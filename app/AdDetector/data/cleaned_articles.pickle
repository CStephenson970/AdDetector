VLast week, Samsung recalled 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. But it seems like every day we\u2019re hearing stories about the defective devices being the potential cause of everything from burning Jeeps in Florida to flaming hotel beds in Australia. Now, authorities are investigating a house fire in Horry County, South Carolina with a possible connection to the infamously combustible device.  The remains of a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 believed to have started a house fire in South Carolina (WMBF News screenshot) Wesley Hartzog plugged in his Galaxy Note 7 to charge inside his garage this past Sunday. He then left to pick up his two daughters, and when he got home, Hartzog, who works as a firefighter himself, found his garage in flames. I spoke with Hartzog over Facebook Messenger, where he explained that he purchased the phone sometime around the 20th of August, right when it was released. Hartzog says he didn\u2019t notice anything weird when he plugged it in on Sunday. Investigators haven\u2019t determined for certain that the phone was the cause of the fire, but they definitely asked Hartzog about it. \u201cThe origin of the fire has not been confirmed yet,\u201d Hartzog told me over Messenger. And with all the recent stories of exploding phones, it\u2019s certainly emerging as a likely suspect. Hartzog didn\u2019t know about the recall and is now living with his family in a hotel. Thankfully, no one was hurt in the blaze. Samsung, as we\u2019ve noted in previous stories here at Gizmodo, didn\u2019t go through proper procedures to make their recall \u201cofficial.\u201d If they had coordinated with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, there would be a coordinated effort to get the Galaxy Note 7 off store shelves and faster guidance from federal agencies about what to do. Now, nearly a week after the recall, the FAA still hasn\u2019t decided whether or not to ban the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from flights. And again, that\u2019s a product of Samsung not going through proper channels to make their recall official. Qantas airlines in Australia has at least prohibited passengers from charging the Galaxy Note 7 on its planes, even if it hasn\u2019t placed an outright ban on bringing them on board. So, best of luck air travellers? Wesley Hartzog walking through his burned out garage where it\u2019s believed his Galaxy Note 7 started a fire (WMBF News screenshot)\u000a[WMBF News]

VKFC\u2019s Wicked Wings have their fair share of fans, and now KFC is trying to reinvent them, presumably to convert even more people to the wing side. The result: the Cola BBQ Wicked Wings, which are deep fried, crispy chicken wings smothered in a sticky cola bbq sauce. No at this point you\u2019re probably in one of two camps \u2014 either you\u2019re wondering what kind of psycho makes a cola sauce for chicken, or you\u2019ve made (or eaten) said cola sauce at home yourself, and you think it\u2019s a perfectly rational idea. In case you\u2019re one of the former: no, cola BBQ sauce isn\u2019t some fast-food abomination that\u2019s been cooked up just by KFC, it\u2019s actually a fairly popular side for ribs or chicken (at least in some parts of the world). Now, down to the actual chicken. The pieces are actually quite good-looking, a crispy golden brown smothered in thick, dark sauce. You can smell the sweetness from the moment the box is opened, and it doesn\u2019t disappoint when it comes to tasting.  The cola sauce is, appropriately, very thick and very sweet. Despite being drenched in it, the wings stayed nice and crunchy, and the texture was one of the highlights. The sauce is what carries this dish, with nothing too special being done to the wings themselves. In fact while they carry the Wicked Wings name, they\u2019re anything but wicked, lacking any sort of spice. While the wings as they are now are definitely tasty, even a little bit moreish, they\u2019re missing something. As a lot of the people who tasted it pointed out, the spice really would have balanced out the sticky sweetness of the cola sauce. Without that, they might as well be a dessert.   Here\u2019s what some of the people around the office think of the wings: Mark Serrels, Managing Editor: \u000aThe chicken was definitely KFC chicken. This is a compliment. KFC chicken is great and I love it. The chicken was definitely wings. Wings are hard work, but worth it.  The cola thing: I definitely tasted it, and wasn\u2019t averse to it. I actually quite enjoyed the sweetness of it, to the point where I\u2019m investigating how I can get that flavour on my own chicken when I cook it.  So yes, great success. I enjoyed it. Would definitely eat more. Amanda Yeo, Early Morning Sub Editor: I was sceptical going in, because my previous experience with cola-sauced chicken wings left me searching for the cola, and my feelings toward sweet meats are often ambivalent at best. However, I was happy to find that the taste of Coke was immediately apparent in the sauce on these wings. I\u2019m not sure I liked the sweetness, but I could definitely identify that it was cola.\u000a br>\u000aMy major gripe was with the wings themselves. They\u2019re touted as Wicked, but they are at the best Mildly Offensive. Though they had the crunch, the wings lacked the heat and spice that I associate with Wicked Wings, and were visibly paler than their tastier elder sibling. Not to say that they weren\u2019t tasty \u2013 they were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and I still ate them up. They just weren\u2019t as tasty as proper Wicked Wings. I also felt that the sauce was almost entirely separate from the wings \u2013 they didn\u2019t complement each other. It felt like the sauce belonged to a different dish altogether. Given the choice, I\u2019d just go with regular ol\u2019 Wicked Wings over their cola-covered counterparts. Rae Johnston, Gizmodo Journalist These wings aren\u2019t very wicked, but they sure are sweet. The cola sauce is actually really nice, and the flavour of the crumb is your stock-standard familiar KFC secret spice mix deal. After the pulled pork incident, I was concerned \u2013 but these wings are great. They have the comforting satisfaction of eating something you know is awful for you, with all the greasy regret. Solid 5/7. Simon Thomsen, Executive Life Editor, Business Insider: If you think fried chicken should be a dessert, KFC has answered your prayers.  Quang Tran, Account Manager:  I have not touched KFC for years so can\u2019t really recall exactly what the original is like. The wings I tried today were pretty good especially the batter, it was crunchy without being too greasy. The sauce however was too sweet for my liking and I would have preferred a chili sauce to compliment it. Joshua Casemore, Sales Executive: The additional of BBQ sauce really bring out a new flavour to KFC chicken\u2026 And it\u2019s definitely a good one! Tegan Jones, Commercial Editor: I was apprehensive about having cola on my wings, but I found the taste to be quite nice! However, as a self-professed Wicked Wing aficionado, I was a bit disappointed by the lack of spice. In my opinion, the Cola BBQ are dessert wings \u2013 something sweet to use as a chaser after smashing about 10 of the originals. Bianca Heuvel, Finance And HR Manager: My initial reaction was \u201coh no this does not look good\u201d. The first bite was not what I expected and initially I did not like it. However, I took another bite and actually enjoyed it. I suppose I was expecting spicy which disappointed me. The crunchiness was great. Nat Sussman, Account Manager: They were nice\u2026 but I feel like the \u2018Cola\u2019 flavour could have been stronger. I\u2019m also very much an advocate of the traditional devil wing, with a kick of spice. Not for me.  Overall the wings were nice, but not a standout. Unlike KFC\u2019s recent, disastrous pulled pork burgers, however, I could see myself actually ordering these if I was in the right mood. If you\u2019re not a fan of the spice of regular Wicked Wings, these may be for you. KFC\u2019s Cola BBQ Wicked Wings are available for a limited time only. Chicken wings are mostly bones, we chuck them in with the compost after we have cooked our own chicken. We then eat the boneless pieces.\u000aWe do not ever eat KFC second-class over-priced food. These are just normal wicked wings with cola flavoured diabetes squirted on them - and even then the coverage on the wings is very hit and miss. Not much cola taste but definitely super sweet. Mmmm finger licking diabetes. just what the doctor ordered.

VBack in May, the US Air Force announced that they had received over 4,600 entries in their crowdsourced naming contest for the new B-21 bomber. The announcement even said that they\u2019d narrowed it down to 15 finalists. So, naturally, I did what any weirdo blogger does: I filed a Freedom of Information Act request to see the list. Today I got a letter from the US Air Force officially denying my request.  Everybody with an internet connection knows that crowdsourcing names for things can be a disaster. Just ask Boaty McBoatface. So when the Air Force decided to crowdsource the name of their latest high-tech B-21 stealth bomber, I was intrigued. Especially since development of the aircraft is believed to be costing somewhere north of $US42 ($55) billion. (The actual price tag is a secret.) Spending billions on the latest high-tech killing machine capable of carrying thermonuclear weapons and then turning over the naming of the thing to \u201cthe crowd\u201d seemed like an odd choice. And I really wanted to know if anyone suggested something like Bomby McBomberface. Granted, participation in the naming contest was only open to members of the US Air Force and their families. But that makes it all the more interesting. Will the 12-year-old daughter of an Airman be naming the Air Force\u2019s new bomber? What are the safeguards to make sure references to dank memes don\u2019t get plastered all over the B-21? The denial letter I received to my FOIA request states that the B-21 Integration and System Management Office \u201cdetermined that the requested records are properly withheld at this time in accordance with 5 U.S.C. §552a Exemption (b)(5), as pre-decisional, deliberative process information.\u201d That\u2019s the exemption that\u2019s sometimes known as the \u201cbecause we can\u201d exemption in FOIA requestor circles. The letter goes on to say that the Air Force \u201cwill release and post a list of the names officially considered by the Air Force\u201d online after a final decision on the bomber has been made. That part about releasing names that were \u201cofficially considered\u201d makes me think that perhaps we\u2019re not going to see the Bomby McBomberfaces and Harambe Fly So Highs that were submitted. But we\u2019ll see, I guess. The letter contained a bit of news I wasn\u2019t expecting. My FOIA request also asked for the list of 15 finalists that were being considered. The Air Force now claims that this list was never made, despite the fact that I got this information from an official Air Force press release. If the Air Force thinks I\u2019m trying to spoil their fun, I\u2019m not. And I can live with waiting a bit longer for the list. The Air Force Association\u2019s Annual National Convention is coming up later this month, and we\u2019re supposed to hear the official name for the B-21 there. But I do think that it\u2019s worth exploring why they decided to crowdsource this naming process in the first place. I also think it\u2019s worth finding out whether the B-21 project has cost $US33 ($43) billion, $US42 ($55) billion, or $US100 ($130) billion (the US Air Force won\u2019t say, and Senator John McCain thinks that\u2019s BS) before these things start zipping through the skies in 2025. I can't imagine Bomby would not have been part of the list. I would have named it Tronald Dump myself Nukey McNukeface? Pssst!  I suggested 'Arku' ;-) its protoindoeuropean for bow and arrow. Need to know...

VOfficially launched at IFA in Berlin, Medion\u2019s first phablet, the Medion X6001 (pictured above), is now available from the Medion UK webshop and through selected online and retail partners for £250. The Medion X6001 features Android\u2122 5.1, Lollipop and boasts a 2.0 GHz octa-core processor and 2 GB of RAM. The slim 7.9 mm phablet has a large 15.24 cm / 6\u2033 HD display with IPS technology and resolution of 1,920 x 1,080pixels. For extra convenience, the Medion X6001 also supports inductive charging without the use of a cable. On board is a 13 MP digital camera with flash, autofocus and digital zoom on the back. The Medion X6001 is also equipped with an 8 MP front camera with flash for selfies and video chatting. The 32 GB internal memory provides plenty of space for movies, music or photos. At IFA, Medion also presented its first 4G high-end smartphone. The £220 Medion X5020 features Android\u2122 5.0, Lollipop andwill be available in black and white. Corning Gorilla Glass protects the front as well as the back against scratches and hits. While the black model comes with a grey metal frame, the white model is available in two versions, either with a silver or with a rose-gold frame. Thanks to the powerful 1.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor as well as 3 GB of RAM the Medion X5020 can, claims the manufacturer, handle even the most demanding apps and games. The large 12.7 cm / 5\u2033 full HD display with IPS technology and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 boasts a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. On the back there\u2019s a13 MP camera with flash, autofocus and digital zoom and on the front a 5 MP front camera for selfies and video chats. The 32 GB internal memory provides enough space for movies, music or photos but it can be expanded to up to 128 GB with a microSD or microSDHC memory card. Medion claims the 2600 mAh Li-ion battery runs for a long talking time of up to 440 minutes and for up to 185 hours in standby. One handy feature is the dual SIM function which allows for two micro-SIM cards, so that two phone numbers can be used in parallel.

VYou know you have to tailor both your resume and your cover letter to every job you apply to, but it\u2019s easy to do so much that they overlap. They should complement one another instead, to tell one story about your skills. Before you send in your application, make sure they fit together nicely.\u000a\u000aImage from bearstache. It\u2019s easy to repeat your work history or skills on your resume when writing your cover letter, as you want to share those things to show why you\u2019re a good fit for the job. But your cover letter should complement your resume, not duplicate it. Before sending in your application, compare the two and make sure they\u2019re a complete story of your skills and background, with one adding to the other, but both standing well alone. Cut out any repetition and use the space in your cover letter to share anecdotes or other specific examples of your skills in your resume that reflect why you\u2019re a strong candidate. How to Cut Down Your Cover Letter to One Page [The Muse] Nobody reads cover letters anymore sorry to say.

p14
VA few days out of Apple\u2019s (almost certain, but not guaranteed) iPhone 7 launch, a last-minute image of a new iPhone colour has surfaced on the \u2018net. And you should forget rose gold: this dark black finish is the new hotness. Coming to us from Macotakara via MacRumours, this picture \u2014 low resolution as it is \u2014 tells you everything you need to know: I don\u2019t know about you, but I think that looks awesome. Five colours in total are rumoured for the iPhone 7, which is largely expected to keep the same design and shape, but add both a dark, matte black finish and a piano black \u2014 remember the iPhone 3GS? coming alongside the usual silver, gold and rose gold. The two blacks will replace the darker space grey, says MacRumours. Beyond that, the current state of rumour is much like what we\u2019ve already heard: a new, faster processor and larger 256GB maximum storage option, as well as the dual-lens camera that we\u2019ve been seeing around the traps \u2014 with one lens for wide-angle shots and one for telephoto and portraits, but using the same image sensor to maintain equal image quality. The iPhone 7 is most likely to appeal to iPhone 6 and older owners, as well as the legions of Android users out there thatare tempted by Apple\u2019s ease of use and top-down ownership of everything from devices to operating systems to apps. Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar, says that iPhone owners generally last two years between upgrades: \u201cThe 6 and 6 Plus were released in 2014, and account for the largest share of Apple\u2019s current installed base. So we would expect those owners to be among the largest group of upgraders to the iPhone 7. \u201cThe potential buyers for the iPhone 7 could be anyone who\u2019s upgrading now, or looking to upgrade in the next six months. iPhone owners who, regardless of whatever model they own, average about 25 months with the same phone. If we think about anyone who bought a 6 or 6 Plus two years ago, or anything older \u2013 which would include the 5S at the time \u2013- they\u2019re about ready now to upgrade to a new phone.\u201d From grey to black? Do I hear an echo? Have I been here before? Does this also mean that the iPod will be coming back? Back to Black. Like the black iPhone 5; I bought it then and regretted it 'cause of the way it'll easily show of age after a few scratches. And you should forget rose gold: this dark black finish is the new hotness.Sorry Campbell but I'm definitely not with you on that one - if the photo is indicative of its actual appearance I think it looks cheap and nasty, almost plasticky. Could just be the photo of course, the resolution is certainly lacking. On the plus side, no one will notice when you put a cheap plastic case on it. But she's got a new hat!! It'll look great for the first six months, until the paint starts chipping off I like it, but I mean, it's an iPhone, it's too thin, it'll get a case. and an ugly official Apple battery case. Do apple even make a battery case? I'll stick with my ugly quadlock case so I can click it onto my handlebars. The ugliest, least-Apple iPhone case is straight out of Cupertino:\u000ahttp://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/MGQM2AM/A/iphone-6s-smart-battery-case-white Geez and $165 too! I thought my S7 Edge case was pricey at $77 but at least it looks nice! Cases and screen protectors are horseshit moneymaking crap to me. Try rawdogging it on your next phone. It's hard I know, but I decided to have no screen protector and no case for my now 2 year old iphone 6. I work in an industrial environment too. Heck, I accidentally left it on top of one of my PA speakers whilst playing a gig and it flew off there when I moved it and landed face down on the pavement. I thought I was fucked. Zero cracks, zero chips, zero scratches. They're tougher than you think. Also, apple go to all the trouble to make a little work of art, a beautiful looking phone, then people cover it up with a gaudy fugly case. Makes no sense. Rawdog it. It'll be just fine. Rawdog is the way forward! It's just scary at first with a $1249 piece of glass lol! Totally agree, I've had mobile phones for the last 15 years, never had a case on any of them. In that time I cracked one screen (Xperia Z3). I like to enjoy my phones, I find a case ruins the aesthetics almost always. With you Campbell....looks awesome! Hope iOS 10 comes with rumoured Dark mode as well! Looks exactly like my 5s...so unless it has a Samsung battery, I can't see the "hot As" aspect! Haha what a burn! (Literally!) Well just returned Note 7 ExplodeY and canceled contract with Optus, no troubles no questions. Good service...hello new iPhone 7 see you soon... wow look at us. Kids staving in Africa and we getting giddy over a new colour iPhone. If you're not interested in anything less important than kids starving in Africa, you may have come to the wrong blog. Kids starving in Australia too, they won't eat my old iPhone though. Guess they aren't THAT hungry. Let me reframe the discussion. Kids are starving in Africa and you're wasting time in the comments section on the internet? As opposed to the black that isn't black? Uhm...

VOklahoma was hit with an earthquake this week, its second 5.0+ quake this year. The increased number of earthquakes have been linked to the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking \u2014 specifically the underground disposal wells where the run off from fracking is stored. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission has taken note of the relationship between the quakes and the wells and has ordered the shutdown of 35 disposal wells.\u000a\u000aImage: J Pat Carter/Getty Images \u201cThis is a mandatory directive,\u201d Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin told CNN. In February, after a large earthquake shook the state in January, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission cut back on the planned number of wells produced via fracking. Clearly that did not seem to do the trick, which is why Fallin and company are instituting this new shut down. Fracking is inextricably linked to Oklahoma, which was the site of the first test of fracking back in 1968. But in the last 20 years fracking has become increasingly common. In 1998 a new fracking technique was developed in North Texas that allowed companies to extract natural gas from shale very cheaply. Since then use of the technique, which shoots water and chemicals into the shale to forcibly move natural gas up and out into containers above ground, has exploded. From Canada to Texas to Australia, it is the preferred method of natural gas extraction. But shooting all that water into the shale makes normally very stable rocks very slippery. And slippery rocks means a lot of movement. That\u2019s where Oklahoma\u2019s recent rash of earthquakes are coming from. [CNN] I'm ambivalent about fracking, but:\u000aIntuitively I'd have thought that releasing that pressure as small quakes is a good thing?\u000aWhat do the quake experts have to say about it? This is from the United States Geological Survey website: "Injecting fluid underground can induce earthquakes, a fact that was established decades ago by USGS scientists. This process increases the fluid pressure within fault zones, essentially loosening the fault zones and making them more likely to fail in an earthquake. When injected with fluids, even faults that have not moved in historical times can be made to slip and cause an earthquake if conditions underground are appropriate." I'll clarify my question:\u000aCan enormous infrequent quakes be avoided by safely inducing small quakes through water injection? Good question. Based on my knowledge of structural integrity (which is admittedly limited) I would say no as water injections basically weaken the rock and plates, but you'd need to talk to a Geologist to see what they think. Actually it looks like the USGS did cover this exact thing: "Seismologists have observed that for every magnitude 6 earthquake it would take 32 magnitude 5's, 1000 magnitude 4's, 32,000 magnitude 3's (and so on for smaller earthquakes) to equal the energy of one magnitude 6 event. So, even though we always record many more small events than large ones there are never enough to eliminate the need for the occasional large earthquake. As for "lubricating" faults with water or some other substance, injecting high pressure fluids deep into the ground is known to be able to trigger earthquakes to occur sooner than would have been the case without the injection. However, this would be a dangerous pursuit in any populated area as one might trigger a damaging earthquake." https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9830/3353 What a word. Fracking. Butttttttt. the Energy companies say fracking is perfectly safe and we dont need to test the chemicals they use! On a more serious note. Super glad fracking/ CSG mining is banned in Vic. At least our State government is sane.

p18
VFor nearly a decade, the iPhone has been the gold standard of mobile photography. No other company has come close to making a phone camera as consistently great as the iPhone\u2019s. Now, Apple has once again established its dominance with the iPhone 7\u2019s new camera.\u000a\u000aThe iPhone 7\u2019s camera can now take DSLR-quality photos, thanks to all of the new components jammed into the phone. The iPhone 7 comes with optical stabilisation that allows for exposures three times longer than previous iPhone models. It also has a larger f/1.8 aperture that lets in 50 per cent more light. Finally, the phone has four LEDs that produce 50 per cent more light when the flash is in use. Those are significant improvements on almost every component. The brains behind the camera \u2014 the image signal processor \u2014 has also been upgraded and makes it really hard for people to take bad photos. The sensor reads the scene and uses machine learning to look for people and objects in the photo. Then, the processor sets focus, exposure, white balance, tone mapping, noise reduction and even takes multiple photos and fuses them into one photo. It basically goes above and beyond to make sure you always come away with a great photo, regardless of the shooting conditions. But all of that pales in comparison to Apple\u2019s biggest camera announcement: The iPhone 7 Plus comes with two lenses, one wide-angle and one telephoto, that are both visible on the back of the phone. The combination of both lenses gives shooters a better chance to play with focal length and zooming in photos. The depth of field capabilities are something that is typically only seen in DSLRs. Apple admits it\u2019s not trying to replace anyone\u2019s DSLR camera, but for most amateur shooters, the new iPhone will be the most powerful camera they have ever owned.

Baiting Android fans can only end badly. "For nearly a decade, the iPhone has been the gold standard of mobile photography. No other company has come close to making a phone camera as consistently great as the iPhone\u2019s." Simply not true.  And this isn't about being a droid fan, the statement is simply not true.  iPhone cameras have been consistantly outpeced on paper and outperformed.  HTC had ultrapixel cameras, sony phones have extremely high megapixel high quality cameras, nokia phones have had high end cameras for years. You can't say "DSLR quality" either, That isn't a measurable metric.  A DSLR image can be excelent or terrible, DSLR refers to the camera set up - digital single lens reflex camera - not to any perticular range of quality.  This is a misconception because professional photographers tend to use DSLR camers, not because DLSR makes them good, but because most or all of the good ones are DSLR. That crazy comment about depth of field only being available on DSLR cameras is totally false as well, that tech and ability has been avilable on cameras since cameras took film. What your describing with the image processor is called HDR, and it's been around for years 0/10 poor puff piece, bad journalism, hope apple paid handsomely for it cause you credibility is shot to peices. Steady on champ. YES, the article is wildly enthusiastic and pretty far from factually correct, but some of the points you're trying to make are pretty out there too. Yes, HTC had Ultrapixels. In one device. They were so bad, they dropped them almost immediately. Sony has branding rights for Zeiss, their cameras are no more advanced or high quality than any other manufacturer.  More megapixels does not necessarily mean better images and can often times, mean worse images. The BIG concern here, is that there's nothing to indicate that the author has actually used and tested the camera in the real world, and is just waxing lyrical about the announced specs. The real test, is when people have the phone in their hands for head-to-head comparisons. As far as real world testing, Samsung has been consistently out-performing rivals when it comes to phone camera. Based not so much on specs, but on the quality of the resulting images. Shame they've started exploding really... (relax guys, kidding).

VThere might be no honour among thieves, but there\u2019s certainly plenty of pride, as a disgruntled malware developer recently proved by reaching out to an IBM security adviser over a \u201ccompletely out of date\u201d blog post.\u000a\u000aPhoto: Getty According to Limor Kessem, who writes for Big Blue\u2019s Security Intelligence blog, the developer apparently took issue with a post from April that described an Android data theft app as \u201ccheaper and less advanced than malware like GM Bot or KNL\u201d. \u201cHello , Im the owner and developer of Bilal Bot malware,\u201d wrote the alleged crimeware maker, who used a \u201cmail.ru\u201d address. \u201cYou are giving false information on your website.\u201d \u201cFirst of all , KNL is not for sale since owner \u2018rashe\u2019 is banned in undergrounds and Ganjaman with GM bot and Mazar banned aswell for scamming,\u201d they continued. \u201cSecondly , You took beta version of my bot \u2018Bilal Bot\u2019. Alot more are improved and changed , so your texts together with price chart are completely out of date.\u201d To her credit, Kessem looked into the new version of Bilal Bot after receiving the email, concluding that it was \u201cpossibly\u201d updated. \u201cAs I sit here still shaking my head at this, I might add that the supposed author offered to give an interview to provide us with the most up to date Bilal Bot information,\u201d wrote Kessem. \u201cWell, sure, Bilal Bot dev, we would be happy to conduct that interview.

(Image: NASA Goddard MODIS Rapid Response Team) Earlier today, a Hurricane Warning was issued along a swath from Cabo San Lazaro to Mulege, including Cabo San Lucas, and from Guaymas to Bahia Kino, Mexico. At 1:00AM AEST, the hurricane was located about 180km northwest of Caba San Lucas and 80km west of La Paz, Mexico.  Newton is expected to produce heavy rainfall over a long distance \u2014 from Baja California, Mexico all the way to the US southwest.

VThe Tesla Model S parked outside the company\u2019s flagship Oxford Street store in London Although I\u2019ve written about electric vehicles (EV) for some time, and test driven quite a few in my time, one has always alluded me. The Tesla Model S. It\u2019s probably not the best known EV on the market, at least among the general public, but it\u2019s generally regarded by experts as the best in breed. And with good reason. While some electric cars can feel a little gimmicky \u2013 like you wouldn\u2019t feel you wouldn\u2019t be taken that seriously driving one \u2013 there is something reassuring about the Model S. It looks and feels like a \u2018proper car\u2019, so much so that it could easily be mistaken for a Lexus or maybe a Jaguar, rather than a state-of-the-art all electric vehicle from South African born tech entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s fast-growing company. For the Tesla test drive we headed down to Tesla\u2019s recently opened London showroom on Oxford Street, opposite the enormous Selfridges store. There we were shown the latest version of the Model S (the first models were launched back in 2012). Although I\u2019ve seen the Model S before at various shows and on display at airports, I\u2019ve never been inside.  It\u2019s certainly a very comfortable car. There\u2019s a lot of leg room although I needed to lower the seat as much as possible as head room isn\u2019t the most generous.   With the Tesla supercharger, above, you can get a range of 170 miles from around 30 minutes of charging Great family car One bonus, especially for those with large families, is that it\u2019s a six seater with two rear facing seats in the boot which are suitable for small children. But although there\u2019s plenty of room for your legs there\u2019s not much headroom at the back either, making it unsuitable for older children or adults. What I really like about the Model S is its attention to detail. It may be a small thing, but I love the handles which are flush to the doors until you press them in and they slowly emerge, like a dampened cassette deck from the early 1980s (yes I am old enough to remember). Inside it\u2019s the same too. It\u2019s a bit like how you imagine Apple will design their EV when it eventually comes \u2013 and it will. In fact the control unit in the centre of the vehicle feels much like a giant iPad with a very similar interface. Just about every aspect of the car can be controlled via an enormous portrait-shaped display screen, measuring 17inches vertically. Obviously this includes the voice activated GPS and a giant map which also shows you the distance you are away from your nearest Tesla Super Charger points (these are free for Tesla owners to use although it\u2019s obviously possible to pay to use other charging points too if you aren\u2019t near one of the Tesla chargers). These rear facing seats are great for younger children and can be folded away neatly if you need the boot space In our central London location there were plenty of charging points marked on the map at places like Westfield and Brent Cross shopping centres and service stations like South Mimms. The Model S promises a range of around 300 miles on a single charge with Superchargers able to provide around 170 miles of range in around 30 minutes. When you are driving the range you have left is clearly shown on the display to help overcome \u2018range anxiety\u2019 \u2013 the fear you are going to be stranded in the middle of nowhere with no way of charging your car. Just about every aspect of the car\u2019s functionality from locking and unlocking the doors, turning the windscreen wipers on and off and adjusting the heating can be controlled by the central display. Even opening the sunroof is controlled from here with the amount the sunroof is open displayed as a percentage on the screen! There\u2019s also a companion app too which allows you to switch the heating on in the car before you get in as well as check where you have parked your car and how much the range you have left before setting off on your journey. Voice activated control is provided too apparently, although we didn\u2019t test this out for ourselves. Updates to the system\u2019s software are provided over the car\u2019s built in 3G connection (soon to be updgraded to 4G) although it will automatically sync with the wi-fi, say if you have parked outside of your house. \u000aLook Mum no hands! While most of this functionality has been around for some time, one brand new feature for the Tesla S is called Autopilot. Essentially what it represents is the first stage towards the much hyped autonomous car, in that it allows you to relinquish some of your control as a driver to the vehicle itself. So how does it work? Using a combination of radar and sonar technology built into the vehicle, along with the car\u2019s built in cameras, the Model S is first of all able to determine where other vehicles and objects, such as pedestrians, are around you. These are even shown on the display by the steering wheel with the possibility for you to set the distance you are away from other cars as well as your speed (by default this is set at speed limit for the road). However, the technology goes one step further in that it will also detect the white lines on the road to keep you in lane and if you indicate will move you into the other lane when it is safe to do so. The extremely large 17inch display can be used to control just about every aspect of the car\u2019s functionality from entertainment to air conditioning For our test drive, we used Autopilot for a short stretch along the Westway A40 by Westfield Shopping Centre in Shepherds Bush which apparently has more distinctive white lines than other areas of central London (don\u2019t worry, if the Autopilot can\u2019t see the lines properly it will tell you!) To switch Autopilot on you simply toggle a button on the left hand side of the steering wheel and the car will do the rest. In the UK at least it is currently illegal to take your hands off the wheel while driving and if you are seen by the police you could be charged with dangerous driving. However, I did test out Autopilot by taking my hands off the wheel but ensuring they were hovering just above if I needed to take control back very quickly. Currently the system is set so if your hands are off the wheel for more than a minute it will tell you to put your hands back on! I tested the system for a maximum period of five minutes along a 40 mile an hour stretch of the A40 and was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. Sure the first few seconds were a little bit hairy as I thought we were heading into the car in the next lane as we rounded a bend. But then I realised that actually the technology worked just fine and the car was making subtle adjustments to the steering to keep us in the correct lane. Would I buy this car for the Autopilot feature though? Probably not. For me driving is about being in control and I can\u2019t imagine driving for more than a few seconds with my hands on the wheel under normal circumstances (maybe if you needed to check the screen for some reason it could be useful though). However, I can certainly see the appeal of the Tesla S. It\u2019s a pretty good looking car, stuffed with loads of features and drives pretty well. It also has ferocious acceleration \u2013 though you don\u2019t really get the benefit of that in central London. Obviously the price is still very high, and the £5000 government subsidy you get for buying one is being reduced to £4500 from March 1st. However, I can definitely see me buying the next generation of Tesla, the Model 3 which is due out in 2017 and which promises to be half the price. Three variants of the Tesla Model S are available. The entry level version (70D) has a 70kWh battery and is priced from £58,000 while the larger capacity 90kWh model (90D) costs £69,300. There\u2019s also a range-topping Performance model (P90D) that uses the 90KWh battery and has a more powerful motor that\u2019s priced at £86,800. The Ludicrous Speed upgrade which reduces 0-60mph acceleration time to 2.8 seconds costs another £8,700. A £4,500 government grant is available to all those buying the Model S (£5,000 until February 28th). To find out more about Tesla visit https://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/.  See the gallery below for more pictures:        Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VSay goodbye to your waistlines, and hello to eating a ridiculous amount of cheeseburgers in an attempt to win, well, more cheeseburgers (also maybe a car). That\u2019s right, McDonald\u2019s Monopoly is back! And this time it has a mobile game to go along with it.   I know, I know, the chances of winning anything substantial (fries don\u2019t count) are pretty minimal, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that McDonald\u2019s has worked out a way to gamify one of the things I am really, really good at \u2014 eating.

This article originally appeared on Gizmodo Australia Back in the 90's I won a nice IBM computer system As long as the system isn't rigged like a couple years ago, then it might be worth a shot this time. Few years ago they printed more car winning tickets then they had available cars, it was first in to claim, and they denied all the others even-though they were winners too, McDonalds even called some of them cheats.

VEvery business generates data but you don\u2019t have to be an big enterprise to make use of it. You might not have data scientists employed to dive into the data but you can still get insight from the information. However, you will need a data strategy first.  Data analytics may be intimidating for small business owners but it can be useful helping them formulate ways to address challenges, find opportunities and to streamline operations. But business owners can\u2019t just jump head first into data analytics. A data strategy is essential to set out just how the company will collect, handle, manage and store the information to ensure customer privacy, according to Jen Cohen Crompton, an entrepreneur for The Neat Company. She wrote in Entrepreneur: \u000a\u201cAs an example, I run a small fitness studio. We collect data through a third-party site and all of the collected data is stored within their platform. However, we have the capability to download reports and export content, such as email addresses and member lists. We do not, however, have the ability to access individuals\u2019 financial information, e.g. credit card numbers, from the platform, which provides a level of security for our members and keeps us removed from that sensitive data.\u000a \u000a\u201cWe have implemented a barebones data strategy, which outlines who has access to member data, which computers can be used for downloading reports and how we use our mobile devices to access data. We also have restrictions on permissions for anyone who can log into our third-party site from the backend.\u000a \u000a\u201cWhile this may seem like overkill for a five-person operation, we want to be careful with our data and know exactly who is interacting with it and how.\u201d\u000a You can read more about what to consider when developing a data strategy for your small business over at Entrepreneur.

V\u000a\u000aGoogle\u2019s I/O developer conference starts this morning in California and we\u2019re expecting some pretty big announcements including Android M 6.0, the breaking out of Google+\u2019s Photos app into a standalone entity, new Android Wear hardware, a new Chromecast, and perhaps some news about Google\u2019s VR initiative. However, the big news that\u2019s broken already is that Google is to introduce a \u201cbuy button\u201d to its search results. The button would give Google Search users the option to purchase products directly from the search giant without needing to visit a separate website. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a buy button. It\u2019s going to be imminent,\u201d said the company\u2019s chief business officer, Omid Kordestani on stage at the Code Conference in California on Wednesday. He said he wanted to reduce \u201cfriction\u201d for users so they buy more things online. Google faces significant competition from Amazon, where many people now begin their search to buy products. The change would make it easier for shoppers to buy products featured in its shopping ads that appear alongside search results. Mr Kordestani also noted that about nine out of 10 purchases are still made offline. He added that the number of location-based searches to help users find something close to them had doubled in the past year. Getting users to buy products as a result of searching is a key revenue earner for Google which currently charges retailers a premium to appear in a prominent position on the results page following a relevant search query. \u201cWith Google Buy set to only be available on mobile devices and the search giant recently changing its algorithm to favour mobile optimised sites, it\u2019s clear Google believes that smartphones and tablets are the way forward for e-commerce,\u201d Kevin Dallas from Worldpay eCommerce told the BBC. More announcements will be made at the Google I/O developer conference which starts today. Last year Google showed off its Cardboard DIY VR project with some analysts predicting that Google may even announce an Oculus Rift competitor and a new part of the app store dedicated to VR.

VSony has another new flagship phone in its X Series line-up. Hot on the heels of the X Performance, the new Xperia XZ makes some iterative changes on Sony\u2019s mid-year models like a better camera, USB Type-C charging and an evolved design. The Xperia XZ is the \u201cfirst X Series flagship\u201d according to Sony, even though we were introduced to the X Performance as exactly that this time last year. The new phone, though, looks like it belongs at the top of the pecking order with 2.5D glass and a \u2018loop surface\u2019 curved edge design that hides the phone\u2019s bezel and makes it more comfortable in the hand. You also get the same fingerprint sensor and dedicated camera button on the XZ\u2019s side. Around the back, that small camera module now integrates an updated 23-megapixel Exmor RS sensor and Bionz image processor, as well as Sony\u2019s G lens, but also adds on what Sony is calling \u201ctriple image sensing technology\u201d \u2014 as well as the actual camera sensor, there\u2019s a laser autofocus sensor and an RGBC-IR sensor for white balance. Most of Sony\u2019s competitors have these functions \u2014 contrast or phase detect autofocus sensing and white balance detection \u2014 on the actual imaging sensor itself. But it\u2019s the Xperia XZ\u2019s design \u2014 not its name, which is a pretty un-subtle mashup of Xperia Z and Xperia X \u2014 that should help get it into the hands of prospective buyers. The new phone\u2019s curves are much more agreeable than the old monolithic Z series, but the XZ still incorporates IP68 waterproofing and hides a decent 2900mAh battery. We\u2019ll know more soon about when the Xperia XZ \u2014 in its various colours \u2014 will come to Australia and how much you\u2019ll pay for it soon. Like your phones a little smaller? Sony also announced a new 4.6-inch Xperia X Compact at IFA \u2014 it\u2019s a continuation of the small form factor and otherwise high-end specs of previous phones in the Compact line-up, updated with the new loop surface design \u2014 but there\u2019s a problem. According to Sony Mobile Australia, \u201cat this stage, Xperia X Compact will not be ranged in the Australian market.\u201d Which is disappointing. [Sony] Biggest issue I have with Sony is the update schedule that has ONLY THIS MORNING updated from 5.1.1 (that's lollipop for those of you on beta testing of NOUGAT).\u000aNever again. Where is the larger screen version of all these phones that have been leaked for the last few years and never make it to market? http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-xa-ultra/ Sadly the specs aren't that great, even though the screen (and phone) are bigger. As for the XZ the article should probably highlight the biggest change in the camera - optical stabilisation. Other previews on the net claim it's brought the image quality pretty on par with it's competitors. Though there are still complaints about it's performance. My main gripes are the weird little panel on the back of the XZ (reminds me of the LG G5) not sure if it's got a purpose or whether it's some weird aesthetic decision. The bigger gripe though, is Sony are notoriously slow for getting handset onto the market. If their follow their track record the XZ won't be available in Australia until Christmas, maybe not even this year :( Side note: I liked their angular, monolith design. I'm not impressed just because they round the edges. What is 2.5D glass? Curved edges, but not a curved screen. It's a nice look that makes the phone seem a little bit slimmer. The X Performance has it too. Had a look in Telstra and didn't really like it. Seems like a gimmick to me. As someone who's owned Sony Phones all their life from Sony Ericssons' Clam Shell to the Z3 I can say without a doubt Sony's dropped the ball here I really hate these X Series. So I moved to the S7 Edge and now happy again. Sony lift your game. \u000a									Last edited September 2, 2016 12:30 pm								 I still like my Z3 I've had for the last year & a half & this is the first phone Sony has put out since with worthwhile improvements, not quite enough to warrant an upgrade but if I needed to replace my current device anytime soon it would be a toss up between the XZ & Note 7.

p34
VSky\u2019s 4K-ready Sky Q set-top boxes are set to launch on February 8th with prices starting from £99 for installation plus £42 per month for the entry level 8-tuner model. Alternatively you will be able to get the flagship Sky Q Silver complete with 12 tuners for £99 upfront and £54 per month after. Without Sky Broadband, Sports or Movies, the box will set you back £249 up front. However you can add Sports or Movies when you buy to get the lower price. Both Q boxes will provide Sky TV in two rooms through the main Sky Q Silver box as well as via a Sky Q Mini box (this doesn\u2019t have to be connected to a dish, providing it has broadband access). Despite the name, the flagship Sky Q Silver comes in silver and black variants. Boasting a 2TB hard drive, enough for 350 hours of High Definition TV,  it measures 330 x 210 x 43mm and weighs 1.7kg. Also on board is wi-fi connectivity and a new interface hub called My Q. This brand new interface has kept the same blue colours as the previous one but has loads more graphics, including movie cover art. Like its rival TiVo from Virgin Media, Sky Q Silver provides suggestions on new shows to watch, based on your viewing history, among other features. Other features include the ability to stream TV on two tablets, take recordings with you through Sky\u2019s app, as well as record up to four shows simultaneously while watching a fifth live. The entry level Sky Q features half the storage (1TB) of its big brother, and allows you to record three live shows while simultaneously watching live TV on up to four screens around your home. It\u2019s physically smaller than the Q Silver and tips the scales at 1.47kg The Sky Q Silver features a whopping 12 tuners Says Ewan Taylor-Gibson, TV expert at uSwitch.com: \u201cSky Q is clearly targeting households prepared to pay premium prices for TV. With an installation cost just shy of £100 it could put off those who have benefited from a highly competitive TV market \u2013 and some cut-price packages \u2013 in recent months. \u201cThe cheapest £42 per month deal doesn\u2019t include the most interesting feature, called \u2018multi-room\u2019, where families can all watch different content, on different devices, in different rooms. \u201cBut being able to download and watch a much wider range of content on the go, even on the most basic Sky Q package, will be a sure fire hit with commuters, and families who fight over the remote.\u201d Adds Ewan Taylor-Gibson: \u201cGiven the average UK household only spends £24 a month on their TV, Sky is clearly limiting itself to the top end of the market. But for those who are already invested in their Sky TV package, upgrading to Sky Q could only cost a few extra pounds per month \u2013 which makes it an appealing offer.\u201d However, it\u2019s a tactic that\u2019s positioning Sky further away from cheap, pay-monthly streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, reckons uSwitch.com and this could be a risky move. \u201cThat said, it is catering to demand for flexible viewing and Sky Q has delivered in creating a wireless TV ecosystem for its users.\u201d   I think live streaming to a tablet or other tv would be a good feature, would be willing to pay 3-4 months of sky equivalent price to purchase such a device connected to freesat. As it is Sky is not a company I would feel clean giving more money to.

VEarlier this year, Microsoft toyed with the idea of buying work messenger app Slack for US$8 billion. Now it\u2019s working on a Slack competitor based on its very own Skype brand. Here are the details.  Collaboration tools are essential to ensure teams can work effectively even when some members are working remotely. In recent years, work chat apps have become increasingly popular and Slack is a big player in that market. Microsoft wants in on the action and instead of forking out billions of dollars to snap up Slack, it is creating an offering called Skype Teams to compete directly against it. That\u2019s according to a report by MSPoweruser. Skype Teams will combine familiar features from Slack and more. Users can directly message each other and chat in different groups within a team. Skype Teams will have Threaded Conversation which lets users reply to a message on a channel to create a thread, similar to how Facebook comments work. This is a feature that Slack doesn\u2019t have at the moment. Naturally, Skype Teams will have video calling functions and Office 365 integration. According to MSPoweruser, Skype Teams is currently being tested internally at Microsoft. There\u2019s no launch date as yet. Head over to MSPoweruser for more information about features in Skype Teams. [Via MSPoweruser] Apparently Office 365 subscribers only... Takes away one of the nicer things about Slack, being able to create teams ad-hoc from multiple organisations, across all sorts of platforms, without needing to pay for anything. Whats the difference to Skype for Business, or Lync, or Communicator...? Given how woefully MS have managed Skype in all its forms, can only assume this will fail too.

VDear Lifehacker, I understand how useful it is to have a mentor, or someone whose experience I can benefit from. Once I\u2019ve found someone though, how do I ask them? Do you just email them and ask, or is there a better way to make your case? Sincerely, Desperately Seeking Senpai  Picture: Pakhnyushcha (Shutterstock) and Michael D Brown (Shutterstock). Additional photos by US Army RDECOM, US Army Corps of Engineers, Sharpshutter (Shutterstock), Ashraful Kadir Dear Desperately, You\u2019re right to ask the question. After all, not everyone has the time or the opportunity to be a good mentor. Landing a great mentor means you have to choose the person you ask carefully, ask them the right way, and then know when to follow up (and when not to follow up, for that matter). Choosing the right person as a mentor is probably the biggest factor to whether they will accept your request. Most people want mentors who exemplify their vision of success \u2014 business leaders, entrepreneurs, recognisable names \u2014 it\u2019s easy to want to have a famous businessperson, developer or activist as your personal mentor. But odds are those people are already busy or unavailable, and while it never hurts to ask, the odds are heavily against you. Remember, your mentor doesn\u2019t have to be a household name to be a good one \u2014 anyone whose experience and wisdom you can learn from would make a great mentor. When you\u2019re looking for someone to be your mentor, look for people who have the title, position or experience you\u2019re trying to get. Don\u2019t set your sights too far off into the future. Think about your next few career goals and look for people who match, preferably people you know personally or could easily meet. If your company has a mentorship program, start there. Participants are looking for people to mentor, so you\u2019ll have an easier time finding someone willing to take you under their wing. If not, consider a manager in your own department or another department in your company that you work closely with. Ask a friend or someone in your professional network to connect you with someone in their company who\u2019s willing to take on a mentor and has the position you\u2019re looking for. Whoever you choose, pick someone you can easily meet and talk to face to face. It may seem like a good idea to aim high and ask someone you\u2019ve never met (but whose work you\u2019re familiar with) to be your mentor, but you\u2019ll have better luck asking someone with whom you already have a personal connection. A far-off face on the internet may be able to trade emails with you from time to time, but they probably won\u2019t be able to pay regular attention to you. Someone who\u2019s personally invested in your success and can check in with you regularly when you need advice \u2014 or when you have a question \u2014 is a much better pick. When you do ask someone to be your mentor, keep in mind that you\u2019re asking them for a favour \u2014 one that will likely require a good bit of energy on their part. You\u2019re not paying them for their time, and they don\u2019t owe you anything. If they\u2019re part of a mentoring program or have been a mentor in the past, they probably know this already. Even so, approach the question with the appropriate care, empathy and lack of self-entitlement. The fastest way to get the old \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have time right now\u201d response is to overconfidently demand your prospective mentor\u2019s time and attention. A few pointers to keep in mind: The more you can make a complete case for what you\u2019re looking for, why you chose them, and how much of an investment you represent, the easier it will be for your potential mentor to say yes. Like we mentioned earlier, your mentor should be engaged \u2014 not just with the idea of mentoring, but with mentoring you specifically. If you ask them to be your mentor and then offer to follow up later, follow up to see how they\u2019re feeling about it. if they waffle, or they give you anything less than a confident answer, then let it go and look for someone else. You\u2019re not going to get the best time and attention from someone who\u2019s going to be annoyed every time you ask them out for coffee, or who felt pressured into being your mentor. If you ever start to get that vibe from your mentor, it\u2019s time to let them off the hook, thank them for everything they have taught you up to that point, and offer to stay in touch. If they\u2019re open to the idea, it\u2019s time to seal the deal and give them an idea of how often you\u2019ll connect with them and when you\u2019ll get in touch. They may take the lead, but don\u2019t expect them to. You can take a load off of their plate by mapping out when you should talk and how you\u2019ll be in touch, especially if you just need advice from time to time. Whatever you agree to, make sure you follow up, meet when you say you\u2019re going to, and drop them a line from time to time just to check in. If there\u2019s ever a doubt, take the initiative. Remember, you\u2019re there to learn and soak up as much as possible from them. Don\u2019t make them work just to get a hold of you. Once you\u2019ve landed a great mentor, do what it takes to keep that relationship strong. Not only do you have someone you can learn from, but you\u2019ll have someone valuable in your professional network who can help you when the chips are down, or you can offer a hand to when you have something to offer. When they give you advice, make sure you take it, and when you\u2019re not sure what you should talk about, ask them what you should be asking them. With luck, the two of you will be able to learn a little from each other, and you\u2019ll have the benefit of a guide with years of experience navigating difficult career and job waters to help you do the same.

VThe cause of the enormous blaze last week that destroyed a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as well as Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $US95 ($124) million internet satellite remains unknown. And it could take SpaceX a long time to solve the mystery, judging from the way Elon Musk has been tweeting this morning.  Image: USLaunchReport/YouTube For the first time since the absolutely insane-looking anomaly (technically, SpaceX still won\u2019t call it an explosion) that incinerated a rocket and maybe a good chunk of that rocket\u2019s launch pad on September 1st, Elon Musk took to twitter to vent about his very, very bad day: Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2016  Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2016  Support & advice from @NASA, @FAA, @AFPAA & others much appreciated.

SpaceX still has not stated how much damage its launch pad incurred, or how last week\u2019s disaster will impact its jam-packed manifest of commercial and government launches. One thing, however, seems clear: SpaceX is going to have to figure this one out before it gains the world\u2019s confidence again.

V  Either you\u2019re an artist or a programmer. Of course, there are multi-talented folk out there that can do both well, but if you only fall into the latter category and wish you could just \u201ccode\u201d pictures to your specifications, then a new, shader-based image editor called Shadron is worth a look.  Created by one Viktor Chlumský, Shadron uses GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shaders to manipulate images \u2014 and a great deal more, going by the program\u2019s description. In basic terms, a shader is a program that runs on your GPU and instructs it on what to do with a pixel (or vertex). It can be as simple as modulating the colour, to sampling adjacent pixels and averaging the result \u2014 blurring, essentially. A great deal of Photoshop\u2019s image filters can be implemented as shaders, so being able to hand-craft such effects is a powerful advantage indeed. If you\u2019re curious about what Shadron can accomplish, the lead video does a good job of showing off its abilities. It goes without saying that if you don\u2019t know the first thing about programming or shaders, then Shadron isn\u2019t going to be of much use to you. But for programmers, particularly budding game developers, Shadron could be the answer to a number of your asset creation woes. The app is available direct, or on Steam if that\u2019s your preference. Shadron [Official website]

VToday, Sony officially unveiled a suped-up upgrade to the PlayStation 4 video game console dubbed the \u2018PS4 Pro\u2019. Packing in a faster CPU, an upgraded graphics processor and a 1TB hard-drive as standard, it has been tailor-made for the next wave of virtual-reality,\u000a4K and HDR content. Here\u2019s a rundown of the specification for the new console, when it will be available and how much it will cost in Australia. Like Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Scorpio, the PlayStation 4 Pro is a minor hardware upgrade to Sony\u2019s existing console. This is not a \u201cnext generation\u201d replacement for the PS4. Instead, it\u2019s compatible with all PlayStation 4 games and will be sold concurrently with its predecessor.  In the words of lead architect Mark Cerny, it\u2019s primary goal is to deliver \u201chigh-fidelity graphical experiences\u201d for so-called hardcore gamers and vidoephiles. This is achieved via some extra grunt beneath the hood. Let\u2019s take a look at the chief specifications:   The most noteworthy addition is the AMD Polaris-derived GPU which provides roughly double the processing power of the original PS4\u2019s graphics chip. This will deliver reliable 4K video, boost the native resolution of games and should also improve virtual-reality experiences with Sony\u2019s incoming PlayStation VR headset. The CPU\u2019s core clockspeed has also received a slight boost. If you\u2019re chiefly interested in 4K video playback, it\u2019s worth noting that the PS4 Pro\u2019s optical drive does not support 4K Blu-Ray discs. Instead, you\u2019ll need to rely on video streaming for your 4K content. This seems pretty miserly of Sony, especially considering that the $399 Xbox One S comes with a 4K Bluray player. People are getting upset \u2014 and we don\u2019t blame them.  The PlayStation 4 Pro will launch in Australia the same day as in the US: the day to mark in your calendars is November 10. That\u2019s a little over two months from now.   The PlayStation 4 Pro will set you back $559.95 in Australia. In the US, it\u2019s priced at a more reasonable sounding $399, but it\u2019s important to factor in the exchange rate, shipping and GST. Compared to the PlayStation 3, the \u201cAustralia tax\u201d isn\u2019t too outrageous this time around. Several video game studios are currently hard at work adding enhancements to new and existing titles. Games that will be ready in time for the console\u2019s launch include Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, Black Ops 3, FIFA 17, Battlefield 1 and Mass Effect: Andromeda. You won\u2019t need to buy special versions of any of these games \u2014 instead, the extra graphics and effects will be delivered via a patch to PS4 Pro owners.   Will you be upgrading to the PS4 Pro? Share your thoughts in the comments!

VCould you tell which sex these chickens are for £40K a year? You could probably give it a go We\u2019re used to wacky surveys coming into our inbox to promote a product you probably don\u2019t need or want, but this one really caught our eye. Apparently three in four people can\u2019t tell the difference between real jobs advertised by the Government and fictional jobs taken from science fiction films such as Mad Max, Hunger Games, Dune and Inception. How do we know this? Because a study, commissioned by fishing oilskins manufacturer Stormline (nope I had no idea either, but apparently they are a New Zealand company who make high quality workwear for a number of industries), told us so. And before you go thinking that these 1000 adults they asked must be away with the fairies then it\u2019s worth having a look at the job titles. For example, as a chicken sexer you could earn yourself £40K a year while as a Shader Writer you get to take home a cool £30K a year. Or how about a sleep physiologist (£28K) or a Matte Painter (a mere £20K)? Almost two of thirds of participants (62%) thought the role of Guild navigator, the dark blue, spice-addicted interstellar humanoids from David Lynch\u2019s Dune, was a Home Office in-demand occupation.  And more than half (52%) thought the role of matte painter, a visual effects specialist with an average salary of more than £20,000, was sci-fi. All jobs mentioned are apparently listed as \u2018in high demand\u2019 by the Home Office, with the exception of rock mechanics engineer and sleep physiologist, which are listed instead by the UK Visa Bureau. The study found that: More than three quarters of participants were unable to correctly identify whether the job titles were real or fictional, getting at least one wrong. In total, almost 1 in 3 answers given were incorrect. Jobs in visual design were the most frequently believed to be science fiction. Roles portrayed in films including Her, Hunger Games and Mad Max were considered more plausible than actual jobs from the Government website. The most frequently misidentified job was shader writer. 66% believed this specialist visual effects role with a salary of almost £30,000 to be fictional. Skills gap or science fiction \u2013 the jobs that caused the most confusion Job title Home Office or Hollywood Average salary Film Percentage who couldn\u2019t tell Shader writer Home Office £30,000 66 Guild Navigator Hollywood Dune 62 Texture artist Home Office £28,000 61 Matte painter Home Office £20,000 52 Chicken sexer Home Office £40,000 48 Writer of personal letters Hollywood Her 41 Organic mechanic Hollywood Mad Max Fury Road 39 Head game maker Hollywood Hunger Games 38 Compositing artist Home Office £21,000 31 Reservoir panel engineer Home Office £31,000 28 Protection engineer Home Office £32,000 24 Main force patrol officer Hollywood Mad Max Fury Road 23 Sleep physiologist Home Office £28,000 18 Rock mechanics engineer Home Office £31,000 14 Face dancer Hollywood Dune 11 Extraction practitioner Hollywood Inception 10 Bio repo Hollywood Repo Men 8 Auror Hollywood Harry Potter 6 Ends Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

V  Everyone knows a magic trick or two \u2014 usually of the card variety. While you probably know the ins and outs of that specific illusion, professional magicians have to master an array of skills and talents do their job well. And it\u2019s not just sleight of hand or misdirection \u2014 there\u2019s a psychological component too, as Mental Floss\u2019 Elliott Morgan explains.  Magicians exploit the human mind in a number of ways, say by introducing comedy into their show to reduce the audience\u2019s ability to think critically and as Morgan mentions, even knowing the odds you\u2019ll pick a particular card: \u000a50 per cent of people pick one of these four cards: ace of spades, queen of hearts, ace of hearts and the king of hearts.\u000a I guess for everyone watching the video, that percentage is going to go through the floor.

VThe good news is that a modern cyclone will probably not directly kill you. The bad news is that there are many ways you can kill yourself when a tropical system comes knocking on your door. Let\u2019s talk about the way people die in cyclones/hurricanes so you can avoid becoming a tragic statistic.\u000a Aside from slightly different wind speeds, there is no difference between a hurricane, a typhoon, and a cyclone. They are all different names for the same kind of intense low pressure system. Around Australia, storms that form are simply called \u201ctropical cyclones\u201d and they\u2019re the responsibility of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Cyclones that form in the southern Pacific Ocean are under the responsibility of New Zealand\u2019s MetService.\u000a Illustration: Jim Cooke, Photo: NASA Our ancestors had to deal with a world that lacked satellites, television news, and Twitter. As such, they tended to die heroically in storms while trying to save orphans from the waves. You are a modern person of some means, and so if you die in a storm there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ll be killed by generators, chainsaws, or electricity in a way that is neither heroic nor unavoidable. I live in the US and have been trained to go door-to-door after a catastrophe to mark houses in a way that indicates if anyone inside is dead. I\u2019d rather stay home and read than find your bloated corpse, so please take the following to heart. Every storm is different, but there\u2019s a lot we can generalize.  There\u2019s that great scene in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid where Paul Newman tries to get Robert Redford to jump into a river to escape the law. Redford refuses to do it, admitting he can\u2019t swim, which leads to Newman delivering one of the best movie lines of all time: \u201cAre you crazy? The fall will probably kill you!\u201d It\u2019s backwards with hurricanes. The brute force of the wind of a tropical system is unlikely to kill you unless you\u2019re outside or unlucky enough to have a tree land on you (hint: avoid trees). If you are killed directly by a storm you\u2019ll probably drown. Approximately 76 per cent of deaths directly related to the impact of storms, according to a recent study from the American Meteorological Society, came from water. Specifically, people die from storm surge, which is when the power of the storm moves water and the power of water inland. It is scary. Hurricane Katrina was the deadliest storm of the modern era and most people died from drowning. When you\u2019re asked to evacuate, it\u2019s often because you\u2019re at risk of drowning, even if you\u2019re fairly far inland. A secondary cause of drowning is the flooding often associated with storms and, often, those are people in cars or trucks trying to drive through the water. Even though this is the most common form of death during a storm, if you evacuate properly you will greatly reduce the odds of dying this way in a storm. The study linked above that examined Katrina deaths determined that you were more likely to die if you were older than 75 years and concludes many people were unwilling or, tragically, unable to evacuate. Again, if you\u2019re reading this, you are probably not going to die that way unless you decide to drive into floodwaters or live somewhere that floods frequently and lack the means or sense to flee. Bottom line: If someone asks you to evacuate, listen. Photo: Stuart Wilson/Getty Images\u000aYou know what sucks? Not having power. I\u2019ve experienced enough storm-related outages to sympathize with anyone who lacks electricity for long periods of time. It becomes unbearably hot and sticky during the day. The suddenly darker nights are punctuated only by the sounds of snapping limbs and chainsaws. Not fun. People often respond to this by burning candles or trying to cook with camping implements. I like candles. A candle provides nice ambience. LED flashlights tend to make my skin look pale and green. Hurricane Opal in 1995 took a similar path to the storm currently in the Gulf, striking Florida near Pensacola in early October. There were a total of 27 people killed by Opal, according to the CDC, and as many people were killed after the storm as during the storm. Three people died in fires, and two of them were caused by candles (the other was caused by a propane cooking device). In Hurricane Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989, no one died before the storm hit and only 13 people were killed during the storm. A whopping 22 people reportedly died due to storm-related traumas after the storm and nine of them died either from smoke inhalation or burns from five different fires caused by candles. Most of the dead were children. Bottom light: Buy a flashlight. Photo: Wathiq Khuzaie/Getty Images\u000aRelated to the candles thing, but worth their own section, are generators. Generators are a great thing if you know what you\u2019re doing. A lot of people think they know what they\u2019re doing. They don\u2019t. Then they die. There may be a reason why you need a generator, whether it\u2019s to run a dialysis machine or to maintain some other kind of life-saving equipment. Otherwise, it may be a convenience that\u2019s not worth the risk. In Hurricane Ike, which struck Houston in 2008, two trees fell on the house I was in and I didn\u2019t die. In this way I was fortunate. A total of 74 deaths were directly linked to the storm and of those, a whopping 13 people were killed by carbon monoxide poisoning. That\u2019s more than people killed by drowning (8) and nearly twice as many deaths from generators than deaths caused by trees falling on people (7). Bottom line: Read the manual. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images\u000aIt\u2019s reasonable to want to prepare by boarding up windows and trimming trees so they don\u2019t fall on your house. Like I said earlier, I was in a house that had two different trees crash through the roof. It wasn\u2019t great. If you\u2019re outside the evacuation zone, the best way to prepare for a storm is to buy water, ice, medicine, non-perishable food, and other things you need to be comfortable and safe. Once that\u2019s done, move anything that might fly through the window (like house plants and furniture) inside. The CDC calls it the \u201cpreimpact\u201d period and there are some really unfortunate ways people die. Before Hurricane Marilyn, a teenager in Puerto Rico died of electrocution while trying to remove a TV antenna from their roof. Seven people were killed preparing for Ike, including a man who electrocuted himself by drilling into a live wire while putting screws in his roof and a 10-year-old boy struck by a tree limb someone else was being cut off a tree presumably to avoid having it kill anyone. Are you a professional or well-trained in home repair and tree trimming? No? Bottom line: Chill and then call a professional. Most of the lessons above apply here. A lot of people die after the storm. Ike, again, is a terrible but telling example here, with most of the deaths in that storm occurring after landfall. If you read enough post-storm mortality reports you\u2019ll see a pattern emerging. Often, professionals removing trees from power lines or repairing roofs are killed. One utility worker was killed during Ike. Four people were electrocuted after Hugo, including a professional working on power lines and one repairing a roof. Chainsaws are great. They\u2019re also deadly, whether you\u2019re operating it or standing near someone operating one. During Hugo, two bystanders were killed by trees that were being removed or trimmed after the storm. One person in that storm killed themselves with their own chainsaw. Worse than that? People with bad hearts trying to clean up. After Hurricane Opal there were three people killed due to heart issues related to cleaning up. In Houston, during Ike, 12 people died from cardiovascular illness, though it\u2019s not clear how many of those people died in cleanup. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, or are in poor health, you may be tempted to run out and make things right again. Bottom line: Be careful and ask for help. Photo: Keystone/Getty Images\u000aAssuming you\u2019ve prepared for the storm and aren\u2019t in any immediate danger from the impact, the best thing you can do is find the safest part of your home and stay there and do nothing. Has the storm passed? Is it all safe and clear? Are you grateful to be alive? Great! The best thing you can do is not nothing but carefully do a few things. Specifically, you should account for your supplies and your immediate family, check on your neighbours, do a quick check of your place if you\u2019re a homeowner, verify there are no limbs hanging by a thread or downed power lines threatening your home, call your insurance company, hire a professional to deal with any issues you can\u2019t safely deal with yourself, and then do nothing. Honestly, the best thing a well-prepared person can do immediately before, during, and after a storm is Netflix and chill but, since Netflix may not be working, just softly bone amid the glow of an LED flashlight.

VEvery year for almost a decade, the most anticipated gadget release has been Apple\u2019s iPhone. And with any iPhone release, there are also swarms of rumours, leaks, hearsay and arguments that begin to paint a convincing picture of what\u2019s coming this week. Although rumours and features are always subject to change, this is most likely the next iPhone.\u000a Image: Nowhereelse.fr iPhone 7, right? But it\u2019s not that simple. Although the iPhone commandment reads something like \u201cthou shalt always be an S, and only an S, inbetwixt two new iPhones,\u201d things might be changing for 2016. A majority of earlier reports say that the new iPhone (all two/three variants) will be called the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Pro (maybe). However, a report from a German gadget blog says the device could be called the iPhone 6SE, a continuation of the moniker that debuted with the 4-inch iPhone SE in March, and the embracing of a major change to the iPhone naming scheme. Number to S to SE. The next rumoured iPhone in 2017 will supposedly come with much bigger changes, including an OLED display and an all-glass design. It\u2019s the kind of update you\u2019d usually expect from a \u201cnew number\u201d iPhone. Which means it could be another year before we see the real iPhone 7. But this September\u2019s phone is probably called the iPhone 7. Image: Nowhereelse.fr This is where Apple is probably going to get the most crap from Android fanboys. (OMG, IT\u2019S THE SAME PHONE. WHATABUNCH OF SHEEPLE.) Right now, all leaks point to the iPhone 7 looking very similar to the iPhone 6s, which looked identical to the iPhone 6 the year before. It\u2019s a weird bubble of hypocrisy where people jab at other companies for not changing up their design year after year yet Apple always gets off scot-free. An all-metal design, LCD display, all-glass front display is what we think is staying the same. But much like the last year\u2019s iPhone 6s, there are some tweaks if you know where to look. The Wall Street Journal reported in June that the new iPhone would be one millimetre thinner, putting it at around 6.1 compared to the 6.3mm we have now. That\u2019s not crazy thin like Motorola\u2019s new 5.2mm Moto Z, but that\u2019s thin enough to possibly force you to invest in a new case. That\u2019s also thin enough to mean that one much beloved port may be axed: The headphone jack. This longstanding iPhone rumour dated all the way back to 2014, when Lightning-based headphones started popping up. The only difference is that this time it\u2019s most likely going to happen. Not only have leaks (for the most part) supported the idea, but The Wall Street Journal also confirmed the (missing) feature. Japanese site Mac Otakara, who kicked off this whole audio jack rumour, reported that Apple won\u2019t be including wireless or Lightning earpods, but the standard 3.5mm Earpods with a converter. Steve Jobs probably would have vomited in his mouth a little bit, but here we are. Image: Tinhte.vn (The dongle is or looks very close to this dongle) Supposedly, Apple will be adding a second speaker in the now abandoned audio jack real estate. However, it will probably not be stereo sound like Apple\u2019s new iPad Pros. Additionally, Mac Otakara reports that the iPhone\u2019s home button, while still taking up an annoying amount of space on that bottom bezel, will actually be flush with the rest of the device instead of slightly dipped like other generations. The home button also won\u2019t click. Instead, it will be Force Touch-sensitive (the same tech Apple uses in its Macbook trackpads). Flipping around to the back side, there are supposedly two visual differences. The first is a simple redesign of the iPhone 6\u2019s antenna lines. In leaked images above, they\u2019re still there, just slightly relocated. The other difference is a slightly modified camera bump, likely due to the iPhone 7\u2019s slimmer frame. So, for the very last time: This is what #iPhone7 rear camera bump looks like. IF NOT = FAKE\u2026 Got it?\u2026 pic.twitter.com/01cNjVTaC7 \u2014 OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) July 5, 2016  Of course, in many of these leaks you do see one big head scratcher: A third iPhone. This is apparently the iPhone 7 Pro. It will likely be the exact same size as the iPhone 7 Plus, but will feature an upgraded dual-lens camera, similar to camera units we\u2019ve seen on LG\u2019s G5. The idea is that another lens will greatly increase the iPhone camera\u2019s field of view, something the iPhone could definitely use. Image: Bastille Post (note the Smart Connector) The other rumoured addition on the Pro model is the Smart Connector feature also featured on the iPad Pro, which lets it charge or connect to a keyboard. However, recent reports suggest that after some initial tests Apple has decided to ditch the idea since it wouldn\u2019t really do anything. Probably a good call. However, there is some debate that the Pro even exists at all. The all-around accurate leaker @evanblass says that there are only two models, but the wealth of leaks surrounding the Pro indicates that Apple has at least thought about it. Right now, the truth is a little hazy. The 2 (two!) 2016 iPhone models are codenamed Sonora and Dos Palos. \u2014 Evan Blass (@evleaks) July 19, 2016  The last bit of big news is that some Chinese blogs report that the iPhone 7 will be waterproof, which isn\u2019t too unlikely since the iPhone 6s was damn near waterproof already. If Apple is able to make a fully waterproof (IP68-rated) iPhone, it will finally catch up to Android makers like Samsung, which launched its own H20-defying smartphone with the S7 earlier this year. Although Apple\u2019s design decisions on the iPhone 7 can be best described as divisive, it could receive a generous spec bump. Once again, Apple is reportedly going with the ARM-based A10 processor, which will be built exclusively by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). This will be the most powerful mobile processor Apple has ever made, outclassing the chipset in the already damn fast iPad Pro. The camera is also getting some love. As previously mentioned the elusive Pro model could have a dual lens system. But according to 9to5Mac, the normal 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models will stick with 12 megapixels. However, the sensors will be bigger than those on the iPhone 6s models. This should significantly help with lowlight photography. And because of this dual lens, Apple might also be upping the RAM in its bigger phones to 3GB for photo processing while the normal iPhone 7 will stick with 2GB. Pretty reliable (not 100% but almost\u2026) source told me #iPhone7 battery = 1960mAh (#iPhone6s = 1715mAh) \u2014 OnLeaks (@OnLeaks) July 13, 2016  As for battery, reliable leaker @Onleaks says that the iPhone 7 could see a 14 per cent increase in battery size. Since the screen technology isn\u2019t changing much and the A10 should be more efficient than previous chips, this can only mean only good things for the iPhone\u2019s battery life. After all, more battery means more Pokemon GO. A weird piece by The Wall Street Journal claims Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 will start with 32GB as its base model. That\u2019s good, because 16GB in 2016 is complete garbage for a phone that costs over $US650 ($855). According to a rumour posted to Weibo, the iPhone 7 will also have a max storage size of 256GB, which is an unholy amount of storage. Most of Apple\u2019s software additions are already in the hands of a ton of iPhone users thanks to Apple\u2019s new public beta program. You can read all about iOS 10 right here, especially all the weird stuff they have added to iMessage. But much like Live Photos and 3D Touch for the iPhone 6s, it\u2019s possible that we might see hardware-specific software (like that dual lens camera, for instance). Also, with the improved home button, Apple might have specific hardware shortcuts or Siri capabilities just for the iPhone 7. Usually history can be a good indicator. In the US the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus start at $US650 and $US750, respectively. In Australia they start at $1079 and $1229. And while discussing the supposed max storage size of 256GB, the Weibo rumour monger suggested a price for the iPhone 7 Pro: $US900 ($1183). Clearly, the Pro is either for people who don\u2019t screw around or people that are stupid. One or the other. As for colours, Apple might offer options: Gold, rose gold, silver, space grey and space black, according to Macotakara. This would match the options available with the Apple Watch. According to leaker @evanblass, the iPhone will go on sale September 16, meaning pre-orders will likely begin the week before. @evenblass recently confirmed his original leak, adding that pre-orders being on September 9. Apple\u2019s iPhone event usually falls very close to the 9th, so Apple could be planning an earlier event or speeding up iPhone pre-order and sales once the phone is announced. Confirmed: Pre-orders start on the 9th. You can extrapolate the launch event date from there. https://t.co/gwoPzIM1dI \u2014 Evan Blass (@evleaks) July 28, 2016  tldr; Its more powerful, bigger, costs more, and has a few 'new' features that android has had for several generations This comment above has been cut and pasted from the top of the comments section of every iPhone announcement ever. What a revelation. At least the fandroids are consistent... I often wonder if they have real jobs, surfing the web for apple articles to troll The reason is because its been so true since the iphone 2 was released. If you say so. Why are people so biased about tech brands? I just dont get it. Ive gone from a nexus to s4 to iPhone 6 and now a note 7. Love swapping and changing and playing with different software. There are things Apple do way better than Android and vice-versa . I'd be surprised if youve ever used an iPhone as your daily driver. Why is innovation so important anyway. The tech is maturing and improving an already good formular seems like a better idea than adding a bunch of half baked features. Emperor's new clothes??? Ive never read the tale can you explain the reference? Perhaps you should do you own research as it will help clear up some of your misconceptions. I do plenty. So what misconceptions are you referring to? Care to elaborate or prefer just trolling? Should Apple include a random exploding feature? Innovation in a post-Jobs world: a slightly faster processor; a slightly better camera; a slightly bigger battery; and, make obsolete many of the accessories you might have. Not convinced the removal of the headphone jack is a good idea, it'll be interesting to see how they sell it and how well it's recieved. It will be funny if like Microsoft and the start menu, they reintroduce it back in a couple years time as a great new feature. home button, while still taking up an annoying amount of space on that bottom bezel I've never been "annoyed" by the amount of space the home button takes up. I think you probably need to put your iphone down and go outside for some fresh air. \u000a									Last edited August 30, 2016 11:04 am								 "Steve Jobs probably would have vomited in his mouth a little bit" Because they are going with the most consumer friendly option, and not exploiting the opportunity to force people to pay for an expensive converter. The consumer friendly option would probably have been to keep the 3.5mm jack.  I think the Jobs' vomit would have been because a converter is an inelegant design choice - I guess the point being Jobs would have preferred to let customers deal with the changes much like they had to do when Apple went from 30pin to lightning connector and all the docks and stands became redundant "the new iPhone would be one millimetre thinner, putting it at around 6.1 compared to the 6.3mm we have now." Um... isn't that 200 microns? 1 millimetre thinner would be 6.3mm down to 5.3mm? Details, details.  It's a new iPhone... It's created the metric system 2.0... A revolution!!!!! This all looks a bit yawn worthy to me.  No headphone socket, tiny battery, and a similar design to previous models.  I'm sure it'll sell millions of units but I wish they would do something a bit bold, like Samsung did with the Edge. Hopefully next year's model will be a bit more exciting. \u000a									Last edited August 31, 2016 8:11 am								 Having  S7 Edge, I hope they don't - it's a gimmick, and Samsung's "throw shit at the wall and see what sticks" approach comes up with a lot of those.  But you're right. I think that in terms of hardware though we've reached a point where things get faster and that's about it. The problem with iPhones is iOS and the reason why I switched - for all is speed it's so restrictive. "Every year for almost a decade, the most anticipated gadget release has been Apple\u2019s iPhone."\u000aYup they sure are extremely good at building anticipation I'll give them that. No headphone jack? No problem. Glad to see it gone. NEVER once had to charge and use headphones at the same time and it's a pain in the arse hole to clean out. Even better, maybe getting some bluetooth earpods thrown in? At worst, a set of wired earpods with the new connector. Love the ear pods too even though most don't. Guess they fit my ears perfectly. Buying for sure. My 6 contract is about to run out, so upgrade is a certainty and this time the Plus size. Also, 256g rumoured? Fucking fuck yes......I'm putting everything on it. All my favourite movies, shows, books, entire life..... Cannot wait. 7 more days till the reveal. 14% battery increase?  So that's like, an extra 30 to 40 minutes!

VSometimes I feel like my entire life is spent commuting \u2014 by train, cab, or on foot. But biking is by far my favourite way to get around in my home town of NYC, except for those minutes I spend huffing over the Manhattan Bridge. That\u2019s where Evelo\u2019s Omni Wheel comes in. The after-market add-on can transform most bikes into an electric-powered commute machine. And it works \u2014 for the most part. AU Editor\u2019s Note: The Evelo Omni isn\u2019t yet available for sale in Australia, but we\u2019ll let you know if that changes. \u2014 Cam  All images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Like most things in life, convenience comes at a price, and in this case, convenience will cost you $US1000. It\u2019s an eye-popping figure, but in the context of electric bikes, it actually seems downright affordable. After all, you might already have a really nice frame you\u2019re not willing to part with. The Omni Wheel is a hub \u2014 about the size of Captain America\u2019s shield \u2014 that fits right into your front wheel frame. The wheel is then hooked up to a handle-mounted display and throttle. The display shows your approximate speed and battery life, and the throttle works as you\u2019d expect. Down is go, up is stop. The charging port, housed on the metal hubcap, uses a proprietary three-pronged charger that you definitely won\u2019t want to lose. When you slap this giant hubcap on to your existing front wheel, it\u2019s best to not think of your ride as a bike anymore. The Omni Wheel adds a lot of weight \u2014 between 9 to 10kg depending on the model. So forget a quick jog up your third floor walk up with your newly motorised bike. And, of course, because the hub is so hefty, it subtly changes how the bike handles. For example, the hub makes your bike front-heavy, which means slower response times when you\u2019re swerving to avoid a car door or spaced-out pedestrian. It\u2019s not a design flaw per se \u2014 it just takes some getting used to. But the biggest problem I experienced with the Omni Wheel is wind. Unless you\u2019re cycling every day you probably don\u2019t think about it much, but outdoor bicycles have spokes to mitigate crosswinds. Seal up all those holes, and suddenly, every gust of wind slams into your bike and forces you to rapidly wrench back control.  In New York City, this is an especially big problem since tall buildings have the tendency to create wind corridors. So when you\u2019re crossing an avenue \u2014 one the worst times to lose control your bike \u2014 you can feel the tug of the wind on your handlebars. That said, I never felt like the Omni Wheel put me in any actual danger. It\u2019s like the disk wheels popular with mid-2000 hipsters. They\u2019re not a danger as much as an annoyance. If you overlook its relatively nitpicky failings, the Omni Wheel\u2019s battery blessing starts to feel almost indispensable. I rode with the Omni Wheel almost 48km, covering all three major Brooklyn-Manhattan bridges, and I have yet to suck the wheel\u2019s battery completely dry. Evelo says the Omni provides 64km on a charge, and I\u2019d venture that\u2019s about right, depending on your riding style. The omni charges via a proprietary port. So hold onto the charger. Regardless of its impressive range, I would still charge the thing every single time you get home. Because you do not, I repeat, do not want to be caught mid-ride with a dead battery \u2014 not unless lugging around an extra 9kg for no reason sounds like fun to you. What will keep the Omni Wheel off every city computer\u2019s bicycle isn\u2019t that weight, its the price. For someone who has a beloved bike that they want to endow with electric powers, it might be worth $US1,000. But for most, you should just spring for an integrated electric bike. Yeah, it\u2019s heavy, but it will still handle like a normal bike for the most part. With that being said, I will miss finally being the cyclist yelling \u201cleft\u201d as a I blaze by on the Brooklyn Bridge. I think the Copenhagen Wheel looks promising https://superpedestrian.com/ that if it is ever freaken turns up. its been in development for ages This product illegal in most states of Australia. Australia has mainly adopted the EU pedelec standards that require electric motor assistance to ONLY be triggered by pedalling. Anything that uses an Mobile App or a Throttle to trigger acceleration is in violation of these rules and would require your "motorbike" to be street legal (with indicators and mirrors) and fully registered before you're allowed to ride it. Except for private property. Fill your boots on your own land folks.\u000aEdit (Removed reference to Copenhagen Wheel also being illegal. The Copenhagen Wheel now has a torque sensor and is a true pedelec under EU law! The 250W model is all good for Australia... in most states anyway) \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 12:08 pm								 My electric skateboard has a wireless throttle.\u000aDoes my skateboard run afoul of the same rule? I think electric skateboards are illegal. Some manufacturers refer to them as "wheeled recreational vehicles" but I think most states limit this label to "human or gravity powered" devices only. That means your electric skateboard is a car which does NOT meet the requirements of vehicle registration and is NOT allowed on roads or footpaths. If you can't ride it on footpaths, can't register it for use on roads then the only place you can use it is on private property. This article  (below) is MISLEADING as it just copies what they tell you on electric skateboard website's. But the comments offer much more accurate insights: http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/11/ask-lh-where-can-i-legally-ride-my-electric-skateboard/ The Copenhagen wheel is triggered by pedaling.... also no one enforces those laws. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 9:37 am								 I'm not worried about a fine. Get in an accident and see how well you're taken care of once they ascertain you were operating illegally. Insurance becomes useless.  Get ready to lose your house when a driver sues you for their pain & suffering and property damage. https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/cyclist-safety/power-assisted-bicycles A motorised bicycle is not classed as a bicycle if:\u000athe motor is the primary source of power\u000athe motor's power output exceeds 200 watts (whether or not the motor is operating). Pedalec:\u000amaximum power of 250 watts, with a safeguard allowing for power assistance only when the bicycle is travelling at less than 25km/h and the rider is pedaling. so as long as the power is under 200w, it's a bike if its over 200w and under 250 but has a safeguard its a Pedalec. anymore power or no safeguard its a motorbike and falls under the same regulation as motorbikes. Copenhagen Wheel:\u000a250 watts for the EU market (and Aus),  350 watts in the USA\u000aonly provides power when peddling (no manual accelerator)\u000aso it falls under the Pedalc rules- ie the same rules as non-power assisted bikes \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 12:33 pm								 Thanks for the extra info. I wasn't aware the Copenhagen Wheel folks had added a torque sensor and therefore, now qualified as a true pedelec solution! This is great news! I've amended my misguided and misinformed original post. I still don't like the idea of powering the front wheel. The windage issue sounds like a potential game-breaker.\u000aIs the windage of a passing heavy truck enough to render this life-threatening? Perhaps if the author has problems getting up the gentle slope of NYC bridges, he could adopt some other ground breaking new bicycle hill climbing technology, like having more than one gear on his bike.

Is it a specific game, such as: Runescape, World of Warcraft, or Eve Online \u2013 in these games there is something for everyone. Or is it a comprehensive browser catalogue with more than one excellent game? Once you lock on a browser catalogue  you like you could be in for hundreds of hours of fun, excitement and new unexplored challenges. Strategy games online are full of fun but also require some thinking and ability. There are many games that stand out from the crowd, but not many games are found in one browser catalogue such as the one Plarium offers. This might explain why these games are such a success online. We are talking about Stormfall: Age of war and Sparta: War of Empires, both of which are well known but what\u2019s less well known is that both games have the some creative source. Recently, Plarium has launched a new game, thus adding more depth and variety to its expansive browser games catalogue. This latest game is called Nords: Heroes of the North. Plarium browser games are strategy player vs player enabled games in which the main idea is to create games where gamers can combine the building and army development options. These are always very well appreciated by players who love strategy, with a compelling story and PvP so that the gaming experience is both exciting and interesting. If you find this catalogue interesting, you can look up the game Total Domination which embeds fully voiced characters, high quality graphics and intricate gameplay. These games don\u2019t just look good either, they provide gaming fun experience which is the result of all the things gamers need to do while playing. For example, the PvP aspect is well developed, each player has the option to form into a guild, create trading or political alliances or just go for all out war. Every move requires preparation and strategy. If you like a futuristic setting and battles Soldiers Inc. might be a good experience for you, but if you prefer the high seas and to search for treasures then Pirates: Tides of Fortune is a good choice for letting your imagination run wild. Plarium has taken the latest technology together with simple but very creative ideas, which  include MMO game strategies, animation of 3D battles, and a wide range of new features that combine GDR with tactical MMORPG and MMORTS. Each MMO game offers a compelling story, good graphics and PvP. While some browser catalogues can give a more comprehensive experience, it is up to each game to give the thrills and excitement each gamer is looking for. The most important aspect is to have fun!

p66
VSmall to medium enterprises (SME) are increasingly relying on commercial credit cards to finance their operations, because payment terms for the businesses they supply are stretching out. But if the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) goes ahead with plans to include commercial cards in the new caps on interchange fees, SMEs will be even more hard pressed to make ends meet. Here\u2019s why.  Steve Worthington is an Adjunct Professor at Swinburne University of Technology These interchange fees are a major component of the Merchant Service Fees that all Merchants pay on accepting payment cards. Commercial cards are however operated on a different business model to consumer credit cards. For example, commercial cards have much higher credit limits than consumer cards and the flow of interchange revenue from spending on these cards, to the card issuers (usually banks) enables them to take more credit risk and hence extend more credit to SME\u2019s. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Kate Carnell has said that, \u201cthe majority of small business failures are by far a result of poor cash flow, with slow payments from customers or clients, a leading factor\u201d. She claimed that \u201cthe big end of town are delaying payments to those that can least afford it; small-to-medium sized enterprises\u201d. One example of this is major food businesses Fonterra and Kellogg\u2019s stretching payment terms for suppliers from 90 days to 120 days. The consequences of this are twofold; firstly the large corporations will hold onto money for longer and get positive returns on that, while the SME\u2019s are forced to use expensive overdrafts at banks to fund their ongoing business. A survey by a UK company MarketInvoice earlier this year, found Australia was the worst offender for late payments, ranking even below countries such as Mexico. Some jurisdictions have however been moving in the other direction; since March 2013 the maximum payment terms in the European Union have been 30 days, unless an agreement is made in writing by both parties, in which case the maximum is 60 days. To overcome the cash flow challenges that go on along with longer payment terms, many SME\u2019s use commercial credit cards to pay their suppliers and hence take advantage of the up to 55 interest free days (all the major Australian banks issue commercial cards and the interest free periods are up to 55 days) on these cards. SME\u2019s are using commercial credit cards for more than just their cash flow. These cards can be used to partly finance payments to suppliers, particularly where an SME has struggled to get finance from a bank. SME\u2019s are hence more likely to rely on commercial cards as a source of finance than are larger businesses, which typically can raise capital through a variety of means like bank loans, share issues or corporate bonds. The reduction in interchange which the RBA is imposing may cause issuers, including banks, to cut costs by reducing credit risk, which would mean less credit extended to SME\u2019s, via commercial cards. Issuers could also find this segment of the credit card market less attractive and hence be less willing to offer this type of credit card to SME\u2019s. The RBA\u2019s reasoning for including commercial cards ín the proposed maximum 0.80% interchange cap, is there\u2019s not enough evidence to suggest that issuers will stop providing these cards under the cap. The RBA however accepts that \u201cthis may involve the introduction of fees on these cards and/or the reduction of the interest free period\u201d. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as of June 2015, the SME sector employed 68% of Australians and it generated 55% of total income from industry. As larger businesses look to increase the number of days before they settle their invoices from SME suppliers and these businesses face pressure to pay their employee\u2019s wages and utility bills on time, the value of commercial payment cards is all the more obvious. Less commercial payment cards; with less credit offered on them, at higher interest rates, could well be another unintended consequence of the RBA\u2019s intervention into the payments system. This article was originally published on The Conversation. If their business model was built around charging high credit card fees, then they should change their model.  From now on build your business model around the goods or services you sell, not what you can gouge.

VFollowing the launch of its 4K network camera, the SNC-VB770, Sony has introduced a new 4K video camera aimed primarily at professional use, including wildlife monitoring and video surveillance. Capable of achieving both high sensitivity and resolution with colour video recording in 4K, the £3869.97 UMC-S3C provides \u2013 according to its manufacturer \u2013 the highest sensitivity in its class. This is possible thanks to the full-frame 35mm Exmor sensor and image processing engine. Sony\u2019s UMC-S3C uses a 35mm full-frame sensor to deliver high sensitivity with high light condensing efficiency, and an image processing engine which enhances noise reduction. With the inclusion of compatible E-mount lenses that are optimised to maximise the performance of the 35mm full-frame 12MP sensor, resolution is \u2013 says Sony \u2013 kept high across the entire image area from the centre to the lens periphery. Long duration video recording is also possible with a memory card slot on the camera body, instead of network cabling feature. For example, with a 64GB memory card, users can record up to 125 minutes of 4K footage with standard quality (30 fps/60 Mbps) The camera also accommodates the XAVC S format, enabling high quality recording with 100Mbps high bit rate. This is a huge advantage to users in challenging environments where cabling or space is a huge limitation. Says Roger Lawrence, Video Security Product Manager at Sony Professional Solutions Europe: \u201cAt Sony, we focus on enhancing high resolution and high sensitivity. With this approach, we have been expanding our current 4K product line-up and are confident that we can tap into new markets with the all-new UMC-S3C. The latest video camera is also a testament of Sony\u2019s relentless efforts to provide our clients with solutions that meet their business requirements.\u201d Weighing approximately 400g, the lightweight UMC-S3C is currently the most compact camera among Sony\u2019s line-up in the full-frame camera market. It will be available during the Summer of 2016, Sony has also introduced a new Network Video Management System for managing, storing and analysing content. This system \u2013 which includes the HAW-E and HAW-S series of network video recorders (NVR) and the SOW-E and SOW-S series of server-based video management software \u2013 is designed for a range of commercial video capture applications, including city surveillance, transportation, financial services and education. The Video Management System  supports a wide variety of IP camera formats, including the newest 4K technologies. Adds Sony\u2019s Roger Lawrence: \u201cThis new VMS platform provides the missing link in the 4K workflow. With support for a wide range of existing camera systems and fully integrated  4K support meeting the growing demand for higher resolution, Sony is delivering a one-stop, end-to-end 4K solution for customers based on our cutting-edge imaging technologies.\u201d   Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VA master of his craft is saying goodbye to the comic book medium. Alan Moore has officially announced that he\u2019s moving on from comics to try new challenges (well, after a few more current projects),\u000a Speaking to The Guardian during press for his upcoming novel Jerusalem, Moore said that with \u201cabout 250 pages of comics left\u201d in him, he was officially retiring from comics: \u000aThere are a couple of issues of an Avatar [Press] book that I am doing at the moment, part of the HP Lovecraft work I\u2019ve been working on recently. Me and Kevin [O\u2019Neil] will be finishing Cinema Purgatorio, and we\u2019ve got about one more book, a final book of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to complete.\u000a \u000aAfter that, although I may do the odd little comics piece at some point in the future, I am pretty much done with comics.\u000a Although Moore\u2019s official retirement from comics is sad news \u2014 the man\u2019s extensive, incredible bibliography speaks for itself. So many iconic pieces of comic book history have his fingerprints all over them. But Moore has been discussing this exit for a while now, and has long expressed a desire to pass the torch to a younger generation of comic book luminaries. As he told The Guardian, he thinks he\u2019s reached his natural end point already: \u000aI think I have done enough for comics. I\u2019ve done all that I can. I think if I were to continue to work in comics, inevitably the ideas would suffer, inevitably you\u2019d start to see me retread old ground and I think both you and I probably deserve something better than that.\u000a While there is that promise that one day he might come back for a project here and there, it\u2019s a little heartbreaking to see the end of an era like this. In my dream he is going to Netflix to work on a Halo Jones series.

VA disturbing new report shows that 1.3 million square miles of the Earth\u2019s wilderness has been lost since the 1990s \u2014 an area half the size of Australia. The researchers say this \u201ccatastrophic loss\u201d highlights the need for an international agreement to protect our planet\u2019s invaluable forests.\u000a Deforestation and subsequent development in Bolivia. (Image: NASA Scientific Visualisation Studios) Our planet has lost a tenth of its global wilderness in just two decades, according to a new Current Biology study authored by researchers from the University of Queensland. In a statement, lead researcher James Watson described his team\u2019s findings as \u201cstaggering and very saddening,\u201d adding that the findings \u201cunderscore an immediate need for international policies to recognise the value of wilderness and to address the unprecedented threats it faces.\u201d Watson says we have about 20 years to \u201cturn this around.\u201d No doubt, further losses to the Earth\u2019s forests could prove disastrous. Wilderness areas perform a number of important functions, such as providing fresh water, food, and medicine. Forests are gigantic carbon sinks, sucking up greenhouse gasses and expelling precious oxygen. They also stave off the effects of erosion, reduce extreme weather, and even work to support many of the planet\u2019s most politically and economically marginalized communities. But as Watson points out, our forests are \u201ccompletely ignored in environmental policy.\u201d For the new study, the researchers mapped wilderness areas around the globe, with \u201cwilderness\u201d being defined as an area with biologically and ecologically intact landscapes free from significant human disturbance. The updated map shows that 11.62 million square miles (30.1 million square kilometers) still remain as wilderness, which is approximately 20 per cent of the world\u2019s land area. The majority of these areas are in North America, North Asia, North Africa, and Australia. But then the researchers compared their new map to one produced by a similar method back in 1993. The researchers saw that about 1.3 million square miles (3.3 million square kilometers) of wilderness has been lost since the early 1990s, with a 30 per cent loss of wilderness in South America, and a 14 per cent loss in Africa. \u201cYou cannot restore wilderness. Once it is gone, the ecological process that underpins these ecosystems are gone, and it never comes back to the state it was,\u201d said Watson. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act soon, it will be all gone, and this is a disaster for conservation, for climate change, and for some of the most vulnerable human communities on the planet.\u201d Leading drivers of deforestation include the conversion of wooded areas to farms, ranches, and urban use, but forest management policies and environmental laws are failing to prevent developers from taking these efforts too far. Tropical forests are currently experiencing the worst levels of deforestation, yet they\u2019re home to more than half of the planet\u2019s land and plant species. Deforestation is clearly a serious problem, but it\u2019s not immediately obvious how or if a global consensus can be reached on the matter. Just look at how difficult it\u2019s proving to get an international agreement on climate change \u2014 a crisis that\u2019s staring us right in the face. [Current Biology] Shocking and sad. The end of consumerism, economic and population growth is nigh. With the world's population growing at a billion a decade or so what else can we expect :-( If a catastrophe happens, and nobody notices, is it still a catastrophe?

Plus, don\u2019t expect an Oliver/Felicity recoupling on Arrow just yet, and new looks at Westworld, Outlander, and Channel Zero. To me, my spoilers!\u000a Here\u2019s a clip from the cool-looking horror movie with a terrible name:  And a new TV spot:  Speaking to Entertainment Weekly recently about the lengths the show has gone to protect the identity of Negan\u2019s victim, Greg Nicotero may have let slip that more than one person could perish at the villain\u2019s hands in the season premiere (emphasis added): \u000aBut I\u2019d say in retrospect, I don\u2019t think we would have changed anything. I would have still supported doing it the way that we did it, because of the fact that the story doesn\u2019t end there. If we would have shown the deaths, then they wouldn\u2019t have felt our characters in season 7 the way they need to. And the thing that I think a lot of people will get out of it is how that moment changes the entire makeup of our universe within a split second. And it\u2019s that moment that launches our entire season 7 into that direction.\u000a It may just be a slip of the tongue or an error in transcription (unlikely since Nicotero pluralizes twice) but if it isn\u2019t, we might be seeing more than one long-time cast member depart the show via Negan\u2019s baseball bat. Following recent rumours, a spokesperson for the Angela Lansbury reached out to EW to confirm she will not be appearing on the show after all. The show\u2019s opening two-parter will deal with Kara\u2019s feelings about her cousin being a more popular superhero, according to Andrew Kreisberg: \u000aWhen Supergirl and Superman walk into the room, everyone gets really quiet about him. And her reaction is, \u201cOh, please\u2026\u201d We sort of liken it to if your brother was a famous rock star, or a famous movie star, all you remember is a lifetime of growing up and fighting over who\u2019s sitting in the backseat, and sharing a bathroom, and he pulled my hair. And then you go to a restaurant, and people are sending him drinks, like, \u2018Oh, right this way\u2026\u2019 and that\u2019s sort of Kara\u2019s interaction. People have asked us how do you make sure that Superman doesn\u2019t overwhelm the lead of your show? Rather than shy away from that, we\u2019re embracing it. It\u2019s kind of the idea like, yeah, he is more popular than she is. How does she deal with that? That\u2019s our take on that dynamic that\u2019s between them.\u000a [IGN] EW has an interview with the cast where Jared Padalecki reveals that he and Jensen Ackles are currently thinking they will want to bring the show to an end after it reaches 300 episodes, but nothing is set in stone: \u000aIf we don\u2019t make it to 300, I think Ackles and I will both be truly bummed. When we get to 300, I think Ackles and I will think it might be time to say bye. There\u2019s a chance that changes, but we certainly do not take it for granted that we\u2019re going to make it to 300.\u000a  Don\u2019t expect a romantic reunion for Oliver and Felicity anytime soon, according to executive producer Wendy Mericle: \u000aThey\u2019re both in crisis mode. Oliver\u2019s got two really big jobs, and [Felicity] is spinning out about Havenrock. Until they have gotten some clarity for themselves, there\u2019s not much room for the relationship side of things.\u000a [TV Line] The show\u2019s final season starts November 15h.

VYou probably think of 3D printers as niche devices for DIY enthusiasts to create plastic objects that are a little rough around the edges. Shapeways is different. They use industrial machines to bring high resolution 3D printing to the masses.\u000a\u000aPeter Weijmarshausen cofounded Shapeways back in 2007 with Robert Schouwenburg and Marleen Vogelaar as a spin-off of Philips, the electronics company. They wanted to create a way for normal customers to create rapid prototypes by submitting CAD files to be printed. Of course, when they launched in 2008, the nascent market for 3D printing was much more limited; it\u2019s since become a common solution for hobbyists and professionals alike to manufacture customised objects, and a variety of free 3D modelling apps have also democratised the process. But it\u2019s not just about prototypes any more \u2014 Shapeways hosts a vibrant marketplace for art, jewellery, toys and mechanical parts among other things that are all manufactured on demand. We spoke with Peter to learn a little about how he rapidly prototypes his workflow, so to speak. Here\u2019s how he works. Google Apps. Enabling me to work anywhere. Reading email and docs on my desktops, laptop, iPad or phone. Slack for real-time interactive chat. I have a regular desk in the office. No closed office or cubicle; I work in an open office with the rest of the team. At home I do have a study with a desk and my computers. Printers on the factory floor. Keep your to-do list short. The most important points are on it and get them done ASAP. The less important things are just that, less important. I don\u2019t really use a to-do list manager. I make extensive notes in a paper notebook. Writing things down serves as a good way to remember. via Shapeways. My iPhone cover. It holds my business cards and train card. It\u2019s 3D-printed and designed by Noesis. And of course 3D printers in general. I do not have one at home, but through Shapeways I have access to the best high quality printers that exist! I don\u2019t like to think I am better at something than everyone else before it is proven. However I do like driving cars and I actually raced them in Europe and still on my computer. None of my friends can seem to get to the same times. I go back and forth between listening to electronic dance music and enjoying silence. My favourite DJs are Armin van Buuren, W&W and Menno de Jong. I\u2019m very interested in astrophysics. A book I would highly recommend is A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking. For leadership I would highly recommend the book Leadership and Self-Deception by the Arbinger Institute. I live outside the city of New York and I recharge by going outside \u2014 whether going for a hike or working in the garden. I also love swimming; if I have a chance you\u2019ll always find me in the water. Sorting miniature prints. I used to be a night owl \u2014 going in late and having trouble getting up. We had a daughter three years ago and since then, I get up a bit earlier and typically go to sleep around midnight. I use my iPhone as an alarm clock. Elon Musk. So many things. But one of them is: Approach problems like elephants push over trees. Don\u2019t rush in and bump your head but slowly walk over, put your head against it and and keep pushing until the problem cracks. My interpretation of life hacking is not accepting status quo. So my advice to readers is to challenge how you do things or how things are being done today, because it might be all wrong. Don\u2019t go for a silver bullet, but try to make a small hack first \u2014 improving it \u2014 and then a second hack. Progress one step at a time.

VExtreme, catastrophic flood events like the one that swamped Louisiana last month are becoming more likely because of climate change, according to a hot-off-the-press analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \u000aLead Image: AP The study found that the record rainfall responsible for last month\u2019s epic floods \u2014 the worst natural disaster to hit the United States since superstorm Sandy \u2014 was made at least 40 per cent more likely by global warming. The researchers arrived at that conclusion by applying a new but increasingly popular statistical approach called \u201cweather attribution.\u201d Details of the analysis, which is currently under peer review, can be found in the open-access journal Hydrology and Earth System Sciences. \u201cWe found human-caused, heat-trapping greenhouse gases can play a measurable role in events such as the August rains that resulted in such devastating floods, affecting so many people,\u201d NOAA geophysicist Karin van der Wiel said in a statement. \u201cWhile we concluded that 40 per cent is the minimum increase in the chances of such rains, we found that the most likely impact of climate change is a near doubling of the odds of such a storm.\u201d The no-name storm began around August 11th when a low-pressure air mass rumbled up the Gulf of Mexico, stalling out over the Louisiana coast for several days. As I explained at the time, a combination of high air and sea surface temperatures fed an incredible amount of moisture into this system \u2014 moisture that was then hauled inland and unleashed over neighbourhoods from Baton Rouge to Livingston. Over several days, the storm dumped three times as much rainfall as Hurricane Katrina, with some locations receiving 51cm of precipitation in just 48 hours. Rivers overflowed and flooding ensued. Image: NOAA By August 17th, flood waters had claimed 13 lives, more than 30,000 people had been rescued, and over 60,000 homes suffered damage. For some, it\u2019s easy to look at an event like this and pinpoint the fingerprints of climate change. After all, records show that the frequency of heavy downpours has increased along the Gulf Coast since the mid-20th century, which makes sense because a warmer atmosphere can hold and dump more water. And yet, the majority of meteorologists are still reticent to discuss climate change in their reporting, due to a combination of cultural and political factors, and the relative novelty of scientific research tying planet-wide changes to weather. That\u2019s why the attribution studies now being done by NOAA and others are so critical. They are building a foundation that legitimises the connection between extreme weather and climate change through statistics. Predicted changes in the number of extreme rainfall days by 2041-2070 over a baseline period if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow unchecked. Image: NOAA In the new study, scientists at NOAA\u2019s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and elsewhere examined the risk of devastating, three-day flood events along the central Gulf Coast from the early 20th century to the present. Observational data told the researchers that the frequency of extreme flooding had indeed increased in this part of the country. Using climate models, they were able to reproduce a similar uptick in flood frequency by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That\u2019s the attribution part. According to NOAA\u2019s models, the odds of a Louisiana-like downpour drenching the central Gulf Coast have increased by at least 40 per cent since 1900. It\u2019s worth noting that changes in the frequency of heavy downpours are unlikely to be limited to the Gulf Coast. Climate models show that while some areas, notably the southwestern United States, are expected to become drier this century, others, including the midwest and Pacific Northwest, will likely see an uptick in the number of extreme rainfall days. The point of doing all this is not to arrive at some arcane statistical conclusion. It\u2019s to help emergency responders, planners, and the public understand how weather risks are changing so that we, as a society, can be better prepared. The planet is changing whether we like it or not, and it\u2019s time to adapt. [NOAA] Yet Donald Trump says it's not happening....

V\u000aThe OnePlus One smartphone was undoubtedly one of the most talked about mobile phones of 2014, becoming the smartphone of choice for those power users who were after a premium Android phone for a fraction of the cost of a Samsung model. However, there was just one problem: getting hold of one. Originally Chinese firm OnePlus used a truly maddening \u201cinvite\u201d system to limit the number of people who could actually buy the phone, although eventually you were able able to pick the phone up from the official website invite free \u2013 in either 16GB white or 64GB sandstone black. On August 11th, however, you\u2019ll be able to get your hands on the new OnePlus 2 model, which takes everything people loved about the first model but promises to be faster, more powerful, and prettier.  At the same time, it promises to maintain its budget-friendly status, with 16GB and 64GB models selling for $329 and $389 SIM free in the US. That\u2019s probably around £239 and £289 in the UK. And yes, the company says it\u2019ll be easier to get your hands on one this time around.  Thankfully the OnePlus 2 now has a metal frame, instead of the OnePlus One\u2019s polycarbonate plastic back. The OnePlus 2 also features a 5.5-inch display with a full-HD (1080×1920 pixel) resolution and 1500:1 contrast ratio. It will be powered by a 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 810 v2.1 SoC clocked at 1.8GHz and coupled with an Adreno 430 GPU alongside 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 64GB internal storage. It will sport dual 4G Nano-SIM cards (dual-SIM dual standby), as well as USB Type-C connectivity (with the cable reversible at both ends). The OnePlus 2 also boasts a 13-megapixel rear camera with a 1.3-micron sensor, laser autofocus, dual-LED flash, f/2.0 aperture, 4K video recording, RAW image support, and OIS. In addition, there\u2019s a 5-megapixel front-facing selfie camera. It runs on a 3300mAh battery, and has a fingerprint sensor that can store up to five prints and unlock in under 0.5 seconds. It weighs 175 grams. Says Rob Kerr, Mobile Expert at uSwitch.com: \u201cAt less than half the cost of Samsung\u2019s flagship S6 handset, it\u2019ll be looking to capture the mass market where decisions are based on price.\u201d \u201cThe company doesn\u2019t have the massive marketing budgets of other manufacturers so, in effect, we\u2019re really seeing the true cost of flagship phone, without everything in tow to sell it. If other mobile makers were to adopt this tack, perhaps we\u2019d see a truer reflection of what we should be spending on a new phone.\u201d You can watch our hands on review of the OnePlus One in the YouTube video below:    Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related). When he\u2019s not writing about the latest developments in the connected home, he\u2019s normally driving his little smart car round town. A passionate swimmer, Chris has his own swimming blog and is a qualified lifeguard.

p86
VIn the grand tradition of the tech elite announcing things on Medium, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz \u2014 briefly portrayed in The Social Network by actor Joseph Mazzallo \u2014 penned a post titled \u201cCompelled to Act\u201d to let the world know he will donate $US20 ($26) million to help defeat Donald Trump.  Image: Getty Moskovitz emphasised that while he and his wife have always been committed \u201cto figuring out how to do the most good [they] can with the resources [they]\u2019ve been given,\u201d they haven\u2019t donated to political campaigns in the past because they are \u201cindependent thinkers who respect candidates and positions from both sides of the aisle.\u201d This election cycle, however, is different because, according to Moskovitz, it calls into question who we want to be as a society. The tech billionaire muses: \u000aWill we be driven by fear, towards tribalism, emphasising the things that divide us? Will we focus on how to advantage those most similar to us while building barriers to separate us from the rest of the world? Or, alternatively, will we continue in the direction of increased tolerance, diversity and interdependence in the name of mutual prosperity?\u000a Linking to a number of articles from Vox and Slate, the Wikipedia page for Malthusianism, and some statistics about global inequality, Moskovitz explains \u201cfor the first time, we are endorsing a candidate and donating.\u201d Specifically he\u2019s donating $US5 ($7) million to the the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund and $US5 ($7) million to For Our Future PAC. The remaining $US10 ($13) million will be split amongst Hillary Victory Fund, the DSCC, the DCCC, MoveOn.org Political Action, Colour Of Change PAC and \u201cseveral nonpartisan voter registration and GOTV efforts.\u201d This election has Silicon Valley leaders piping up about their political beliefs more than ever before. In July, a huge group of tech leaders including major players like Steve Wozniak, David Karp, Ev Williams, Chris Sacca, and Moskovitz himself, signed an open letter on Medium denouncing Trump\u2019s \u201cdivisive candidacy \u2026 [and] poor judgment and ignorance about how technology works.\u201d A Trump presidency, the tech elite concluded, \u201cwould be a disaster for innovation.\u201d Moskovitz left Facebook in 2008 to form his own software company, Asana. In 2011, Forbes narrowly named him the world\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire, due to the fact that he\u2019s eight days younger than his old friend Mark Zuckerberg. But while Zuck really, really loves walls, Moskovitz points to the wall Trump wants to build between the U.S. and Mexico as proof that if Trump is elected, \u201cthe country will fall backward, and become more isolated from the global community.\u201d His endorsement of Hillary Clinton, Moskovitz hopes, will \u201cserve as a signal to the Republican Party that by running this kind of campaign \u2014 one built on fear and hostility \u2014 and supporting this kind of candidate they compel people to act in response.\u201d Moskovitz is compelled. He\u2019s acting in response. While many in Silicon Valley are, at the very least, too embarrassed to donate to the Trump campaign, Peter Thiel, who owns 10.2 per cent of Facebook, has expressed his ardent support for the candidate. Earlier this week, the Washington Post published an op-ed by Thiel, which asserts that since Trump\u2019s Republican competitors vastly outspent him in the primaries, he won because he said \u201cthings that made sense to voters.\u201d \u201cSuccess,\u201d Thiel surmises, \u201ccannot be reduced to the overall size of the budget.\u201d Moskovitz, on the other hand, effectively counters that idea with his $US20 ($26) million investment against Trump. In August, it was reported that Clinton has received $US30 ($39) million from the tech sector. Comparatively Trump\u2019s received about 1 per cent of that amount, a measly $US336,000 ($439,429). Thiel\u2019s spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that he has \u201chas no plans to donate to or raise money for Mr. Trump.\u201d We\u2019ll have to wait until November to see who wins the election, but if we\u2019ve learned anything from Thiel, it\u2019s that you can successfully use large sums of money to amplify the power of your ideological beliefs. That last quote about theil is why nobody respects you anymore. Because your entire argument is that you should have won because you had more money than hulk hogan without theil supporting him. So you wanted to do the exact same thing - push ur ideology with cash (or via one sided News articles). So it's pretty much one of the most hypocritical things anybody has ever said. who are you talking to? The author/Gizmodo/dead gawker in its grave. Political Action Groups what an oxymoron and a waste of money.  Its group inability ti do things or blindly follow that leads to a single moronic loud mouth to grab the spot light. Facebook and Twitter's crusade against conservatives continues. Good. Im def not conservative. But is it good? We don't want our media more bias than it already is. The media has been bias toward conservatives for decades. This isn't bias, this is balance. Ugh, what a terrible view to have.

VTonight, NASA will send a spacecraft on a seven-year long journey to bring us back some dirt from an asteroid \u2014 without ever even landing on it. Watch along with us as it launches at around 9am.  Osiris Rex rolls out (Image: NASA/ULA) In 2023, the dirt the OSIRIS-REx mission scoops up from nearby asteroid Bennu will return to Earth in a special release capsule containing the largest amount of off-world samples NASA has received since the Apollo missions. Researchers are hoping that analysing those samples could reveal that the source that originally got life brewing on our own planet could have come from asteroids like Bennu. Before the researchers can get to those samples, though, the spacecraft will first undergo a harrowing journey. That journey will include several passes around the asteroid as the spacecraft conducts a 2-year-long mapping mission and a particularly difficult manoeuvre in which a 3.05m robotic arm will grab a dirt sample from above the asteroid. The OSIRIS-REx mission will be launched atop one of United Launch Alliance\u2019s powerful Atlas V series rockets \u2014 the same rocket series responsible for sending up both New Horizons and Juno \u2014 in its thirteenth major mission flight for NASA. The launch will take place from Florida\u2019s Cape Canaveral station in a 2-hour window between 9am \u2013 11am. You can watch the whole thing happen live with us right here.  Nice to know a real space program is going, not just the commercial bulshit that's full of promise, but short on achievement. You know that NASA doesn't actually make rockets right? They don't even design them. They pay commercial companies to make them. SpaceX is trying to do it at a lower cost, so that NASA and others can do more with less. When SpaceX said they were going to launch and land vertically everyone said that they would fail. Guess what. The ACHIEVED that.  Have they had failures? Yep. Compared to NASA, they've had next to none. The difference is, when NASA had the bulk off their failures, they were not reported on. SpaceX have welcomed everyone in to watch. If there was as much publicity back in the '60s as there is now, NASA would have been shut down inside it's first year.

V\u000aWant to be able to power your home in the event of a blackout? US electric carmaker Tesla Motors has unveiled batteries that can power homes and businesses as it attempts to expand its business beyond electric cars. Chief executive Elon Musk announced the firm would build batteries that store solar energy and serve as a back-up system for consumers during blackouts. The device, dubbed Tesla Powerwall, would allow consumers to get off a power grid or bring energy to remote areas that are not on a grid. At an event near Los Angeles, Mr Musk explained the company\u2019s strategy of using solar power: \u201cWe have this handy fusion reactor in the sky, called the sun. You don\u2019t have to do anything; it just works.\u201d Tesla plans to start shipping the units to installers in the US by this summer. Musk said the move could help change the  \u201centire energy infrastructure of the world\u201d. \u201cTesla Energy is a critical step in this mission to enable zero emission power generation,\u201d the company said in a statement. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery unit would be built using the same batteries Tesla uses for its electric vehicles. Tesla will sell the 7kWh unit for $3,000 (£1,954), while the 10kWh unit will retail for $3,500 (£2,275) to installers. Mr Musk said the company would partner with SolarCity to install the home batteries, but there would be more companies announced. Want to know what Elon Musk\u2019s ex-wife thinks of him and what made him successful. Read her astonishing rant here.  You can see the YouTube video from the launch below:  Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VChristie\u2019s is hosting an auction of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s personal items later this month online from September 19-28th. And there are some genuinely interesting pieces of history for sale. And some rather goofy ones. On the serious side, take this piece of the Berlin Wall, signed by President Reagan himself. \u000aLead Image: A piece of the Berlin Wall signed by President Ronald Reagan, available for auction later this month (Christie\u2019s) Granted, this artifact of the Cold War isn\u2019t cheap. The Christie\u2019s catalogue currently estimates that the item will go for somewhere between $US10,000 ($13,034) and $US20,000 ($26,068). But it\u2019s kind of amazing that it\u2019s for sale at all. Is the Berlin Wall not your thing? How about this football? A football owned by President Ronald Reagan, available for auction later this month (Christie\u2019s) Yep, that really does say \u201cWin One for the Gipper\u201d on it. And for all you kids out there who might not know what the hell that means, it\u2019s a reference to President Reagan\u2019s 1940 movie Knute Rockne, All American, where the former actor played a football star. Reagan became known as \u201cThe Gipper\u201d during his presidential campaign, helping blur the line between Hollywood and Washington more than once during Reagan\u2019s presidency. Is a football still not your thing? Then why not buy a book owned by President Reagan himself? Two of Ronald Reagan\u2019s books which will go up for auction (Christie\u2019s)\u000aThere are quite a few books to choose from. Like Reagan\u2019s personal copy of Ayn Rand\u2019s 1944 book The Fountainhead, seen on the left. It\u2019s a first edition, and as the auction catalogue notes, Reagan called himself an \u201cadmirer of Ayn Rand\u201d in a 1966 letter he wrote. The Rand book is expected to fetch between $US400 ($521) to $US600 ($782). Or if children\u2019s fantasy books aren\u2019t your cup of tea, how about Reagan\u2019s copy of the 1944 book Night Unto Night, made into a 1949 film starring Reagan and Viveca Landors? It will probably set you back about $US300 ($391) to $US500 ($652). Still not enticed? Well, let me try one last thing that\u2019s up for auction. What if I told you that you could be the proud owner of something that regularly touched Ronald Reagan\u2019s butt? I thought you might be interested. A pair of American \u201cSeniah\u201d armchairs owned by the Reagans, up for auction later this month (Christie\u2019s)\u000aYes, these Seniah chairs, designed by William Haines, were in the White House during Ronald Reagan\u2019s time in office. As you can see from the photo below, President Reagan and Nancy would enjoy a private dinner (with the White House photographer, of course) while sitting on them. The chairs are estimated to go for about $US1,500 ($1,955) as a pair. Which is practically a steal if you\u2019re a diehard Reagan fan. President and Mrs. Reagan having dinner on TV trays while sitting in their Seniah armchairs on November 6, 1981 (Ronald Reagan Library)\u000aThere are hundreds of items that are going up for auction, so feel free to peruse at your leisure, but I must say that if none of the things I selected look interesting to you, don\u2019t waste your time. Buy one for the Gipper.

p94
VDesigned by design entrepreneur Yves Behar from Fuseproject, the new Hive 2 display looks beautiful I\u2019ve had the British Gas heating control system for quite a while now, since April 2013 in fact when it was first introduced. See our review here. Back then it was called simply enough the British Gas remote heating control. It wasn\u2019t particularly pretty but it did the job well enough. Later it was re-branded Hive (no idea why they changed the name) and a new version launched, complete with hot water control. You can see our review here. Unlike the previous unit which looked and felt like an old fashioned heating thermostat, Hive 1 looked much more like a small web tablet, albeit one without a colour display or touch screen controls. Now Hive has been upgraded with a brand new look again. This time it\u2019s much more like the Google Nest system which is its closest rival in the UK. However, unlike the Nest thermostat which is a circular device with a rotary dial on the outside for control, Hive 2 is a neatly styled, square-shaped control unit in a reflective chrome finish. Heating and hot water control are provided by turning the small rotary dial in the middle (this can also be pushed in to confirm selections) and there are three subtly marked buttons at the bottom which light up in when in use for back, menu and confirm options. A colour display is provided which shows the actual temperature as well as the target temperature plus there is a display at the top showing the hot water and central heating schedule. On top of the unit are two \u2018boost\u2019 buttons to switch the central heating and hot water on immediately for up to six hours \u2013 handy if you decide you want to have a bath or shower but haven\u2019t programmed the hot water to come on. The Hive 2 with different coloured side panels. For owners of the original Hive, setting up the Hive 2 is relatively straightforward. You have to take the old thermostat off the wall, making sure you take the batteries out so that when you go through the set up process (see YouTube video below) \u2013 a process taking about 10 minutes or so \u2013 you don\u2019t end up setting the old device up again. You will also need to drill two new holes into the wall on which to mount the Hive 2 because (slightly annoyingly) it is a different size and shape to the former device. Unlike the previous unit which was quite difficult to program, the Hive 2 is much more intuitive thanks to the central rotary dial and the three buttons on the bottom which take you through the various menu options. Indeed, it\u2019s perfectly possible to schedule all of your heating and hot water requirements without resorting to your Hive Home account on the computer or via the smart phone app. However, I prefer to use the computer because I find it slightly easier to use the sliding scales to adjust the heating schedules and change the temperatures. All in all, the Hive 2 is a great bit of kit. It looks lovely and is much easier to use than the previous device. It has also been designed to work in conjunction with a range of other connected home products which are due to launch very soon. These these include Hive Active Plugs (to control appliances remotely via the Hive app), Hive Motion Sensors (to detect movement in your home if you are away), Hive Window and Door Sensors (fairly self explanatory that one) and Hive Active Lights so you can turn lights on and off from wherever you are in the world so that it looks like your home is occupied even if it\u2019s not. We look forward to testing some of these Hive products in due course. The Hive 2 is available to buy for £99 for existing Hive customers. For new Hive customers it costs £249 including installation.  Watch how to upgrade from Hive 1 to Hive 2 in this YouTube video below:  1 thing big missing from the hive, unlike the nest the hive does not show you how much time the heating has been on throughout the day. Yes this is true. I\u2019d also like to see these kinds of services integrate with the provider to give you the actual costs of your heating and hot water on a daily basis. That would be really useful.

VThe iPhone 7 has officially arrived. Earlier today, we got to play around with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus following the company\u2019s big launch event in San Francisco. We also got to try out the new wireless AirPod headphones. Here\u2019s an early, hands-on look at what it\u2019s like to use them. Now, bear in mind that we were only given a few minutes with the new iPhones in a packed room full of noisy journalists and photographers. As such, these are our fleeting first impressions rather than an in-depth hands-on. We\u2019ll be back with a more in-depth take of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in the weeks ahead. First off, let\u2019s talk about the phone\u2019s appearance. We got to try the new Jet Black version. It is super shiny; basically a mirror. As you\u2019d expect it\u2019s a bit of a fingerprint magnet so you\u2019re going to need to keep the wet wipes handy if you prefer a pristine finish. (Either that, or pump for the matte black version.) Apple also warned the journalists in attendance that it scratches easily. Yikes. The iPhone 7 Plus has a dual-lens camera with a telephoto lens. The telephoto lens lets you use optical zoom up to 2x. We zoomed on some random guy\u2019s nose. The optical zoom means the photo won\u2019t get distorted when you zoom in. The iPhone 7 Plus will also let you add this blur effect to the background of portraits. The home button is now pressure sensitive. That means it doesn\u2019t physically press in. Instead, the phone vibrates when you press down. Oh yeah\u2026 and there\u2019s no headphone jack! You\u2019ll have to use special headphones that plug into the Lightning port, wireless headphones, or an adaptor included with the iPhone 7 that works with regular headphones. These are AirPods, the new wireless headphones that go on sale separately for $299 in October. They look just like the wired EarPods, just without the cable on the end. They\u2019re actually really tiny \u2014 it\u2019s easy to see how people will lose them. In addition to transmitting audio to the ear, the AirPods also have a microphone so you can make phone calls. They pair to your iPhone when you flip open the case. We can attest that the process is way easier than pairing by poking through your settings menu. You charge the the AirPods by placing them in their case and plugging in a Lightning cable. Overall, the new iPhones aren\u2019t a big change over last year\u2019s models. We\u2019ll be back with a proper review soon. Watch this space! This story originally appeared on Business Insider. Additional reporting by Chris Jager. What a rort. Charge more for crappy headphones that will easily fall out and get lost. Charge more for flimsy adapter cables so people can use real headphones that don't suck. Yep, situation normal for Apple. Then dont buy it, so much salt over products that you seem to care too much about

VWe\u2019re fans of easy, \u201cset and forget\u201d investing. And that means investing in funds with low fees that don\u2019t eat into your returns. A study from Morningstar found that funds with low fees are generally more successful.\u000a\u000aPhoto by Pictures of Money. We\u2019ve told you all about index funds and how they make investing easy and less scary. Another reason to love them? They\u2019re usually cheap. However, some investors argue that their low fees, or expense ratios, come at a price: You get lower returns over time. But Morningstar\u2019s study found that cheap funds actually perform better than more expensive, actively managed funds. It was enough for them to declare that \u201cfund fees are a strong and dependable predictor of future success\u201d. To gauge a fund\u2019s success, they looked at historical data and how much the fund earned over time. Using that number and several other performance factors, they came up with a success ratio to measure how well the fund did over time and what percentage of those funds survived and outperformed similar investments. Here\u2019s what they found overall: \u000aWe found that the cheapest funds were at least two to three times more likely to succeed than the priciest funds. Strikingly, our finding held across virtually every asset class and time period we examined, which clearly indicates that investors should keep cost in mind no matter what type of fund they are considering.\u000a In one example, the five-year average return for US Equity funds with an expense ratio of 0.65 per cent was almost 11 per cent. Similar funds with a 2.2 per cent expense ratio only yielded 8.8 per cent. Of course, you could make the correlation-causation argument here. Just because a fund is cheaper doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that\u2019s why it\u2019s performing better. However, there\u2019s an important relationship between performance and cost. And Forbes contributor John Wasik breaks it down: \u000aWhy are cheaper funds more likely to succeed? Managers aren\u2019t running up costs trying to (unsuccessfully) time the market in many cases. Their fees aren\u2019t devouring total returns. That\u2019s why I invest in them in my portfolios, including an array of Vanguard funds.\u000a It\u2019s just another reason to go with low-cost fees in your portfolio, rather than actively managed ones. Over time, they earn a solid, steady return. For more detail, check out the press release below, and you can download the study from there.

p100
VAdd this to the growing list of reasons to never go outside again: The human brain is apparently a sponge for toxic magnetic waste found in smog.\u000a\u000aImage: Andy Wong/AP That\u2019s according to research published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, which examined the brain tissue of 37 individuals age three to 92 living in the UK and Mexico City. The study found extraordinarily high levels of magnetite, an iron nanoparticle that has been indirectly linked to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s. While biologically-produced magnetite crystals were also found in the patients\u2019 brains, small, perfectly spherical iron particles outnumbered natural magnetite roughly 100 to one. By carefully examining the particles using electron microscopy, atmospheric scientist Barbara Maher and her colleagues discovered they are precisely the same form of magnetite found in air pollution. It\u2019s the first time this common air-borne pollutant has been directly associated with the human brain. \u201cThese are tiny, tiny little particles \u2014 they\u2019re only about the size of a virus,\u201d study co-author David Allsop, a biologist at Lancaster University told Gizmodo. \u201cIf you breathe them up through your nose, they\u2019re going to bypass the blood brain barrier and enter the brain quite readily.\u201d Magnetite nanoparticles are emitted to the air via car exhaust, power plant smokestacks and pretty much any other industrial, fossil fuel-burning process. \u201cMost fuels will have a bit of iron as an impurity,\u201d Maher explained. \u201cWhen you have enough heat and a source of iron, you get these very distinctive molten droplets. If they cool quickly enough, they keep that shape.\u201d According to Maher, the particles are found everywhere: \u201cI haven\u2019t made any measurements of a roadside where they haven\u2019t shown up,\u201d she put it. And at less than 200 nanometres in diameter, they\u2019re far too small to be filtered by a breathing mask, making it nigh impossible for urban residents to avoid some level of exposure. How much of a danger magnetite nanoparticles pose has yet to be determined, but there is reason to be concerned. They are part of a family of metals that produces reactive oxygen species on contact with organic tissues. \u201cReactive oxygen species damage the brain,\u201d Allsop said. \u201cThere\u2019s already evidence for this specific type of damage in Alzheimer\u2019s, possibly very early in the course of the disease.\u201d Allsop added that some of the young brains examined in the study showed changes that look like the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s, supporting the notion that magnetic nanoparticles can cause cellular damage consistent with what we see in dementia. \u201cThis is not the last word at all, but it does mean we have to progress the research now,\u201d Maher said. Of course, we already knew that air pollution is terrible \u2014 it accounts for some 5.5 million premature deaths each year by contributing to asthma, heart and lung diseases. Whether or not magnetic waste on the brain should be our top concern as far as dirty air goes, the discovery offers a timely reminder that cleaning up our atmosphere won\u2019t just help the planet, it will save lives. [PNAS] i guess cyclists are going to be at more risk should they be in busy high traffic areas.

VAirbnb has long dealt with a problem of racist hosts who discriminate against people for reasons including race, ethnicity, and gender. After facing widespread criticism and class action lawsuits, the burgeoning startup valued at upwards of $US25 ($33) billion is rolling out new rules in an attempt to combat racism.  Airbnb now says it will try to rely less on user photos, which provide an easy way for hosts to discriminate against potential guests. The company will also roll out an \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy. This means that Airbnb will find guests another place if they feel like they have been discriminated against. It remains to be seen whether any of these new polices \u2014 which include a \u201cpermanent, full-time product team to fight bias and promote diversity\u201d \u2014 will actually work to curb discrimination. Airbnb\u2019s 34-page report, detailing research into the discrimination by hosts, claims that the company \u201cgenerally confirmed public reports that minorities struggle more than others to book a listing.\u201d The report also found that Airbnb users who complained of discrimination \u201cdid not receive the timely, compassionate response they expected and deserved.\u201d In some cases, like the ones involving lawsuits, Airbnb completely ignored some users who complained about discrimination. The report also concluded that Airbnb\u2019s own workforce, just like every other tech company in Silicon Valley, is not sufficiently diverse. Accordingly, Airbnb plans to roll out more \u201cInstant Bookings\u201d which allow someone to book a short term rental on the service without receiving prior approval from the host. In the meantime, discrimination is still a real problem for Airbnb. On Thursday, for instance, Gizmodo found a listing on Airbnb in Washington DC that didn\u2019t allow for guests who travelled to the city via bus, which is typically a cheaper travel option than a train or plane ticket. When we reached out to Airbnb about this particular listing, the company said it is \u201cinvestigating this particular situation and will take appropriate action.\u201d We will update this post when we hear back. All that said, these new policies seem like a genuine effort by Airbnb to fix a serious problem. Airbnb needed it, too. It\u2019s hard to become a beloved tech startup that wants to change how people travel, if the service offered is viewed as inherently racist and discriminatory. But again, we\u2019ll have to wait and see if the policies will be effective. [The New York Times] If I was renting my place out, I'd want to see a photo of the person that wants to stay there. Surely it's someone's right to decide who can enter their property, even if their reasoning is discriminatory or based on flawed logic? Does Airbnb own the house? No. They are taking a service provider comission on the renting of one person's home to another. If the owner says no sex, drugs, smoking, alcohol, communal gatherings, pets, children, loud noise...who cares. That listing discriminated against smokers, pets and children and bus ppl. Discrimination is everywhere and it is not AirBnbs job to change it. If i want to discriminate against who can and can't stay in my house, I damn well can.

VA Hungarian-born man is found ranting in the street that he is \u201cking of the Puerto Ricans\u201d. A perfectly healthy woman feels compelled to undergo over a dozen operations. A man in a straightjacket somehow manages to commit suicide while inside a locked psychiatric ward.\u000a\u000a\u201cThe nightmare of schizophrenia is not knowing what\u2019s true.\u201d Russell Crowe as mathematician John Nash struggles with mental illness in A Beautiful Mind. These are just a few of the compelling stories in Mark Rubinstein\u2019s new book, Bedlam\u2019s Door: True Tales of Madness and Hope. Rubinstein is a former practising psychiatrist turned novelist who has drawn on his years of clinical experience to follow in the nonfiction footsteps of Oliver Sacks, shedding light on the complexities of the human mind with real stories about real people. Gizmodo sat down with him to learn more. Gizmodo: What drove you to write this nonfiction book, after years of clinical practice and novel-writing? Mark Rubinstein: It all came down to my wanting to tell the general public a little bit more about mental illness. When someone has a physical illness, people feel some kind of empathy, but they still respond to an obviously disturbed person with fear. It\u2019s not just your heart, lung or liver that\u2019s sick \u2014 it is you. That is very threatening to people. And people don\u2019t really understand the mental health dilemma, and the issues that mental health practitioners face. Gizmodo: You brought a novelist\u2019s sensibility to these stories, with composite characters and reconstructed dialogue. How much is fiction and how much is nonfiction? Rubinstein: It is kind of a combination of fiction superimposed on a nonfictional layer of things that really happened. These were all real people and real cases \u2014 sometimes a composite of more than one person to protect their privacy. Oliver Sacks was accused of unwittingly giving away the identities of some of the people he wrote about in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. I never wanted to be accused of anything like that, so I changed everything: Times, places, people, venues, even races. I didn\u2019t even use a real hospital. Of course, I couldn\u2019t remember all the dialogue from 30 years ago, but I created dialogue consistent with the story line. But these were all real stories and real people from people I had treated. There isn\u2019t a story in there that isn\u2019t true. But the overarching theme running through most of the stories is that even with the most bizarre cases, if time is taken to listen to these people and understand their stories and background, perhaps we can offer them help. It\u2019s all about storytelling. That\u2019s what novelists do, and in a sense that\u2019s what patients do when they come to see a psychiatrist: They tell a story. Gizmodo: I was struck by your statement that even people who suffer from the same diagnosed condition can have very different stories. Rubinstein: [Mental illness] can affect almost anybody, given certain circumstances. Some of the most successful people on the planet have a touch of hypomania. I know physicians and attorneys who don\u2019t have full-blown manic episodes but they are filled with boundless energy. They are restless. They feel bored and unhappy unless they are facing a challenge. And they are highly successful. Take that to a more severe degree, however, and it can be completely disabling. And 100 different people can have 100 different pathways to the same diagnosable psychiatric disorder.\u000a *** Rubinstein: In one case, a police officer was shot while sitting in his patrol car outside a store near Tompkins Square Park in New York City. A bullet smashed through the windshield and hit him in the armpit, ruining his brachial plexus \u2014 a complicated series of nerves that serves the entire arm. He almost bled to death in the ride to the hospital, and he was crippled for the rest of his life. The depression, the PTSD, the pain he felt in his right arm \u2014 the pins and needles and tingling \u2014 was directly related to the psychic impact of that half-second of impact. Then there is the man I call Nathan, found ranting on Delancy Street that he was the king of the Puerto Ricans. He was a carpenter, born in Hungary, and that skill saved his life at Auschwitz. He watched people disappear into the gas chambers \u2014 his family, his entire village. He was the sole survivor. But his PTSD didn\u2019t develop until 40 years later, when he was in America and fell off the ladder while working on a roof, breaking some vertebrae in his back. He could no longer work and began having horrifying nightmares. It\u2019s called delayed onset PTSD. So these two men came by totally different pathways to the same condition. The infamous electroshock scene from One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest (1974). Gizmodo: In both your preface and conclusion, you talk about how mental illness has always been stigmatised throughout history. Is it really any different today? Rubinstein: Well, today we don\u2019t torture people. As recently as the 1950s, they were lobotomising psychotic patients. They removed a good portion of the white matter of the frontal lobes of the cortex, and turned those people into \u2014 for lack of a better term \u2014 the walking dead. They became blunted and unresponsive to most emotional stimuli. It was done to try to improve their lot in life, but it shows how primitive things used to be. When I was in resident psychiatry, the cops would drag a guy in and tell me, \u201cThis guy belongs in the loony bin, doc.\u201d Even if the person was just drunk, they wanted to dump these people off in the psychiatric emergency room rather than take them to the precinct. They didn\u2019t want to be bothered with an agitated, fulminating individual who was obviously disturbed. What\u2019s really changed is there is a much more scientific and compassionate approach. The popular conception of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) still exists from a famous scene in the 1974 movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest \u2014 Jack Nicholson with the bulging eyes and convulsions and coming out of it like a vegetable. But they now use unipolar leads, and very low, slow pulse electricity. They administer muscle relaxants, so there is no convulsion. There is hardly any retrograde amnesia and what little there is resolves with a matter of days. It doesn\u2019t take 12 to 18 sessions any more, it only takes between four and six. Gizmodo: You end on a somewhat surprising note of optimism, given that these are such very sad stories. I am curious about why you see hope for the future. Rubinstein: No matter what kind of progress we make, there will always be people slipping through the cracks. There will always be people who either don\u2019t want to be helped, or can\u2019t be helped for some reason. But transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive new treatment that, so far at least, according to preliminary findings, has tremendously good effects \u2014 with no side effects or ingestion of chemicals. Then there is the promise of gene therapy. At some point in the not too distant future, neuroscience will advance to the point where blood can be taken from a newborn child, and based on that baby\u2019s genome, scientists will be able to predict what mental dysfunctions or illnesses that individual will have a predisposition for. Imagine if you could do that for people with a high risk of schizophrenia or severe bipolar disorder, based on the genome analysis of a two-day-old baby? It would put every psychiatrist out of business. So in the long run, if the human race survives as a species, I think the prognosis medically [for mental illness] is very good. I am not sure that I am optimistic about the survivability of the human species, but I am optimistic in that limited way. Suppose you could sample a person's blood [or saliva], and decide they are predisposed to paranoia.  What if this information was then used to decide who to employ? You'd have the opening premise for the movie Gattaca. Did you know that in South Korea they actually stereotype people based on their Bloodtype.\u000ahttp://www.korea4expats.com/article-blood-types.html In business dealings I have had with Koreans, they even said that Bloodtype was an important thing to list on Resume, because it would determine whether you were suitable as a supervisor role, or more artistic, or PR etc. Can gizmodo do an article on rTMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) which is briefly mentioned in the article? They wirelessly deliver small electric shocks to very specific areas of the brain (smaller than 1cm) without pain. Its very fascinating. Soon my undead lobster army will be assembled, and I shall seize the crown of the potato-people.

VPolaroid has launched two cut price, Ultra High Definition (UHD) or 4K TVs. Available exclusively at Asda, Stuart O\u2019Connor reviews the larger 65inch model and asks whether it is worth the money If you\u2019ve never experienced a big-screen television before, then prepare to be gobsmacked. because the first thing that you notice when you unbox the 65in Polaroid Series 6 TV is that it is BIG. It\u2019s too big for one person to handle, which means that it needs two people to set it up \u2013 for both the actual size of the thing, and the weight (it\u2019s about 22kg). But it\u2019s decently thin at just 38mm. Once you screw the legs on and have the TV sitting on the platform of your choosing, the rest of the setup is pretty easy and straightforward. Tuning in the 27,147 channels available these days (only about five of which you will ever actually watch) is automatic and fast, and once done, setting up a \u201cfavourites\u201d list is a piece of cake thanks to a decent remote and an intuitive menu. But like most of us, you probably won\u2019t be watching anything through the actual TV \u2013 you will probably be using a games console or a set-top box (although the TV does have built-in Freeview HD and Polaroid Smart Portal). And it would be best to do so, as the built-in TV tuner is pretty average \u2013 if watching through an Xbox One, for example, you will notice quite a difference in the picture quality. Great 3D pictures Round the back of the set, connectivity consists of an aerial slot, four HDMI ports (better than many modern TVs, but still not really enough), three USB slots, AV inputs, a Scart socket, a digital optical audio port, a VGA PC input, a CI card slot and a LAN port for an ethernet connection \u2013 the TV can also go online via Wi-Fi. The set also features Bluetooth connectivity and comes with four pairs of quite comfortable 3D glasses. One thing this TV is great at is 3D. Watching 3D films is a joy, with decent colour and brightness and very little ghosting (and any of that is more than likely down to the film itself and not the screen). The picture quality from Blu-ray is also crisp and sharp, as you would expect from a 4K HD screen. Both sizes of the Polaroid Series 6 (it also comes in a 55in model) feature a 3840×2160 display, which again will deliver a clear, sharp image depending on the source material, There is not a lot of content being broadcast in 4K (UHTV) yet, though there is some on BT Sport, Netflix and now Amazon Instant Video. Gaming troubles Where the screen falls down a little is with gaming. When there\u2019s not much action happening on the screen, the image is \u2013 as with films \u2013 excellent quality. But when there is a lot of movement going on, the TV seems to struggle to keep up with the action, which means the picture can get a little blocky \u2013 which is indicative of the processor struggling to keep up. So if you are after a new 4K HD TV to mainly watch films etc on Blu-ray, and not for gaming, then the Polaroid Series 6 is worth a look. The range is available exclusively at Asda and is priced at £699 for the 55in and £1099 for the 65in model. And if you can afford it, then bigger is certainly better.   Stuart is an Australian journalist who has been living in London for the past 11 years, and was formerly the Technology Production Editor for the Guardian newspaper and website.

VOver the past few years, Sony has repositioned itself not as just a middling peddler of TVs and Blu-ray players and home audio gadgets like soundbars and Bluetooth speakers, but also the mass market leader in high resolution, super high quality personal audio devices. It\u2019s something the company has had credentials in since the original \u201970s Walkman, which genuinely revolutionised portable music in a way that wasn\u2019t equaled until the iPod.  Now, in 2016, at the 70th anniversary of Sony, the latest Walkman is the pinnacle of quality. That has culminated in a digital audio player that will cost you $4299 in Australia \u2014 and that\u2019s before you buy an equally high quality and equally expensive pair of headphones. The audiophile\u2019s dream source that we\u2019re talking about here is the NW-WM1Z, something that Sony describes as its \u201cPremium Walkman with High-Resolution Audio\u201d. It\u2019s a 124.2×72.9×19.8mm, 455g lump of metal and glass and leather and silicon, plated with gold, that promises the best personal audio listening experience you\u2019re probably ever likely to have \u2014 the \u201cultimate sound experience\u201d, in fact. And look, I think they\u2019re right. This isn\u2019t even about bit-rates and braided cables and lossless audio paths, though \u2014 though that\u2019s what Sony is selling the NW-WM1Z on, because that\u2019s what audiophiles obsess over. The smallest difference in DACs and capacitors and internal wiring and all that stuff; I\u2019m not too bothered about that beyond an academic level.  What I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s hard to pick up a Walkman, of all pieces of audio equipment, that has been built to the highest standard, designed with the utmost respect, and that promises the most to the listener, and not fall in love a little. I\u2019ve always liked high-quality audio gadgets, and I\u2019ve spent too much money over the years on a succession of new headphones, new sources and high quality music tracks that I rarely if ever listen to. But in the same way that reading a paperback book has that tactile sensation to it, listening to music is an equally tactile and emotional experience \u2014 that\u2019s why vinyl is enjoying an odd resurgence in popularity. It\u2019s not a rational choice, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be buying Beats, we\u2019d all still be wearing white Apple earbuds every day. The Signature Series NW-WM1Z Walkman is the most real and tactile digital audio listening experience that I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s an obscene one in a lot of ways \u2014 it\u2019s plated in gold, it\u2019s excessively large and heavy to the point that it\u2019s barely portable, the interface isn\u2019t especially slick \u2014 but when you select a high quality audio track (FLAC at the very least, but something extremely high resolution and a high bit-rate may be technically superior if you have the ears for it?) and play it, something happens. It doesn\u2019t even have to be music that musicians would think is good. You know, your arty friends that think The Decemberists\u2019 lost demo recordings are the only way to listen to them, and to whom Prince\u2019s locked and sealed archive of (probably mediocre) unreleased tracks is the Holy Grail. One of my favourite albums at the moment is Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989, because it\u2019s so incredibly well mastered and crisp and minutely put together \u2014 for modern pop, at least.  When you select a music track on the NW-WM1Z and put on those big, bulky, solid MDR-Z1R headphones that Sony has just launched at IFA 2016 in Berlin as well \u2014 oh, and those are $2999, by the way \u2014 something happens. You get a special feeling that you don\u2019t get with holding a new expensive smartphone or syncing your offline tracks from Spotify or Apple Music. Sound is something weird, and special, and it does funny things to us as humans. That\u2019s why people will spend huge amounts of money to enjoy it in special ways. That\u2019s what Sony is taking to the bank with the NW-WM1Z, and to be honest, I\u2019m on board with it.  It\u2019s impossible to quantify, and it\u2019s just as hard to translate into words. So rather than talk about soundstage and roll-off and harmonics and all that crap, I\u2019m just not going to. I\u2019m going to say that I really liked listening to music with the NW-WM1Z, and that it felt special in a way that few pieces of technology do any more.  In Australia, the NW-WM1Z Walkman will cost $4299, while the lesser NW-WM1A will set you back just $1349 by comparison \u2014 it only has a single headphone jack rather than balanced connectors, 128GB versus 256GB of memory, and so on. An accompanying pair of MDR-Z1R headphones will cost another $2999. The TA-ZH1ES desktop headphone amplifier, into which you can plug a Signature Series Walkman, is $2899. That\u2019s an obscene amount of money, but if you really like your music, you might be able to justify it to yourself. [Sony] Wow, that's slightly over the top. I'm just trying to put myself in the shoes of one of these rich audiophiles and could imagine that you would have an acoustically sealed room where upon a small table lined with silk, next to a comfy chair, would be the Walkman and its headphones ready to be savored?  Because surely any other inferior environment would make it as effective as a normal phone/music player? The mind boggles. ive never listend to or heard high definition audio, and im kind of scared to do so. in the sense, that i will like it too much and not be satisfied with anything else, thus causing detriment to my financial situation.\u000aall though, i dont suppose you are able to do a price comparison, on a high def audio starter pack, that gets you almost as good sounding audio for much much cheaper (or is that just not a thing with high def audio e.g. cant be done cheaply) It is definitely a thing.... a couple hundred possibly 1k will get you 94.2% of the way there... this shit is ridic. I'm sure it sounds amazing but cost vs benefit is totally not worth it. I have more faith in emerging technologies like Nura over traditional expensive audiophile gear. Don't get me wrong I'm still a firm believer in a quality dac, headphones and amp but you can get very far into the audio world in the bang for buck market.... high end audio like this is a feat of engineering and a status symbol more than a worthwhile purchase. yeah i saw that kickstarter too. it looks nuts. i was going to purchase a set, but couldnt even afford the few hundred bucks for the kickstarter amount. I wanted to do it but didn't..... and then a day later I saw they had a 30 day money back thing if you didn't like it, so I did ! Kind of a win/win. If it's as good as they say then I'm sold, if it sucks then I'll send it back. Bit of a gamble but we'll see. It was hugely expensive though, the $229 was sold out so it was $249, then another $30ish for shipping... then when it charged it was in USD so was about $350 all up. I was annoyed but whatever, the damage is done. We'll see if they're as good as they say in April (hopefully they don't miss their delivery date by too much). sweet. hope we get a write up on giz about these. they look like game changers if they can pull it off. $1,000 would be the max I would fork out for a DAP. I find the Korean brands make very good ones for decent prices. Recently got myself an Astell & Kern ak jr which is around $600 which has awesome audio quality and can play most formats including FLAC. Cowon is also a good brand and I use to own their J3. You mention beats in the same sentence as high quality audio gadgets? Read the sentence again -- I talk about Beats quite separately to high quality audio :) For that price you could get the Samsung "smart" fridge! Not sure what's more of a rip off! I think the magic you might be hearing is confirmation bias. Well that's legitimate, then, isn't it? :) I agree with you, that's a large part of high-end audio -- "I paid a lot of money for this, therefore it must be pretty damn good". a blind test against another high quality device would be nice though, just for shits and giggles :) Some of the copy on the Sony site is bewildering audio homeopathy - for example that the resonances of the exotic case of the device somehow make it sound better, which is totally, absolutely bunk. How does this compare to Neil Young's Pono player? The fact that Sony management gave this project the green light ndicates that they have totally lost the plot.

VActual lab tests have revealed that the commonly-cited five-second rule doesn\u2019t hold up. And yet, they still can\u2019t stop me from eating this piece of floor candy! Who\u2019s in charge now, Science?\u000a Image: Christin Lola/shutterstock The five-second rule \u2014 which says that you can still happily snack on fallen food as long as you scoop it back up within five seconds \u2014 has been the subject of some disagreement among scientists. Previous lab tests have suggested that there might actually have some backing behind it, but although the tests took place in a lab, they didn\u2019t come with an accompanying published study. The only published study on the subject had found that bacteria transfer did indeed start happening from the first moment your food hits the floor. Now, a new study published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology by researchers at the University of Rutgers confirms there is no grace period of five seconds for your food to spend on the floor. More bacteria can get on your food the longer it\u2019s on the floor, but, just like in the previously published study, they found that contamination had already started at initial food-to-floor contact. Researches also found that the type of food that\u2019s fallen down and the type of surface it fell onto matters. Falling on stainless steel may sound like the cleanest option, but carpet was actually the best floor surface to eat off of \u2014 beating steel, ceramic, and wood \u2014 probably because its rough texture minimizes contact with the floor. Additionally, the higher the moisture content of the food, the more quickly it picked up bacteria. Of the foods tested, a watermelon sample picked up the most bacteria, while a gummy candy picked up the least. So, perhaps that floor candy is, if not good-to-eat, better than the other options. [Applied and Environmental Microbiology] Five seconds?  Pfffft. If you wait that long in our house, it's been nabbed by the dog. Of course the 5 second rule doesn't work, ewww.  That's because it has always been a 3 second rule, approx. 40% reduction in contact time!!!  Oh, and it's also 2 min. abs,  60 second abs is just  silly!! To heck with the scientists! 90's arcade games taught me that floor chicken gives me back 100% health!

V You\u2019ve probably guessed that a plastic bag can protect your DSLR camera in the rain or snow. But there\u2019s a proper way to use it, as photographer Benjamin Jaworskyj shows in the video above.\u000a\u000aAll you need is a plastic bag, a rubber band and your lens hood. Make sure you\u2019re using a big enough bag that can completely cover the lens and the camera. First, attach the lens hood. Then drape the bag from the lens down over the camera. Put the rubber band on the lens hood to hold the bag firmly in place. Rip open a hole at the lens, and move the bag back. It\u2019s super easy, as you can see in the video above. Jaworskyj also shows you how to add a hole for your viewfinder. But otherwise, you can pop your head into the bag too to see the monitor.

V Attempts to get a live-action Uncharted off the ground have been in the works for ages. And while a release date was announced and a new writer was brought on only a month ago, we might have to wait longer still with a reports appearing that the movie\u2019s release date has been pulled from Sony\u2019s upcoming release calendar. This article originally appeared on Kotaku Australia According to ComingSoon, Sony Pictures has pulled the Uncharted movie from their release calendar. Uncharted was supposed to be coming out in the United States on June 30 next year, but that is now up in the air. The status of the project was a little shaky before then. Joe Carnahan, the producer and writer of Smokin\u2019 Aces and The A-Team remake in 2010, announced he was joining the project at the end of July.But Carnahan isn\u2019t directing. And so far, nobody else is either. A lead star hasn\u2019t been found either.  ComingSoon\u2019s report was also backed up with this note from senior box office analyst Jeff Bock: Insert Pac-Man dying SFX here. Sony's video game adaptation of UNCHARTED, set for 6/30/17, has been removed from their release calendar. \u2014 Exhibitor Relations (@ERCboxoffice) September 1, 2016  I guess it\u2019s better than hearing that Uncharted has been put on ice permanently. But with the way things are going \u2014 remember, Sony Pictures were pushing out press releases for this movie back in 2010 \u2014 it\u2019s getting difficult to hope.  Eight years. Come on. Surely someone can make this movie a thing. Please?

VThere have been many, many Star Trek books out there. Some have delved into the histories of our main characters, some continued the story where the show left off, and others fleshed out characters and species we\u2019d only glimpsed for a second in the show. How Much for Just the Planet? does none of that, instead trying to be world\u2019s first text-based musical comedy.\u000a You\u2019re probably wondering, \u201cHow can a book be a musical comedy?\u201d It\u2019s a good question. How Much for Just the Planet? is a follow-up, in a way, to the original series episode \u201cErrand of Mercy,\u201d where the powerful Organians forced the Klingons and the Federation into a treaty. A planet in the neutral zone between the two powers has a) been colonised by a group of humans who mostly want to be left the fuck alone and b) has also been found to have a large quantity of dilithium. (If you have ever wondered why every Starfleet captain starts drooling at the mention of dilithium, How Much for Just the Planet? describes an educational short film about that very subject. It\u2019s details like these that make the book a classic.) The colonists of Direidi would mostly like for both the Klingons and the Federation to leave them alone, but they also know that the dilithium deposits make that unlikely. So they enact \u201cPlan C\u201d to drive both groups away. This involves the time-honored tradition of acting as strangely and irrationally as possible in order to drive both groups screaming back into space (or at least soften them up a bit before negotiations). In the process, Kirk ends up involved in Shakespearean nightmare involving star-crossed lovers, Uhura is chained to a Klingon while they live out a Raymond Chandler plot, and Sulu and McCoy are captured by an evil queen who wants to make them her slaves. And best of all, Scotty has a duel with a Klingon, fought the traditional Scottish way: a round of golf. Also there\u2019s a pie fight. I practically expect the announcement from Blazing Saddles to show up in this book:  How Much for Just the Planet? is a singular experience as a tie-in novel. Actually, it\u2019s a singular experience as a book, period. I haven\u2019t experienced a book before or since that contains song parodies (the theme from Rawhide stands out the most), a film strip, and cameos. (Oh yeah, John M. Ford gave other authors walk-on parts in his book. Neil Gaiman is the magician.) The references to other people, songs, movies, books, etc. all come thick and fast, and the ones I know I\u2019m not getting drive me crazy, much like the crew of the Enterprise is driven crazy by everything Ford throws at them. There\u2019s also an inflatable Enterprise copy and a starship which, due to a spilt milkshake, suffers from a nervous condition. The poor crew of that ship has their own parallel adventures, and it\u2019s actually nice to see proof that literally everyone in Starfleet has at least one totally bonkers adventure. How Much for Just the Planet? is weird and funny and perfectly balanced and paced. Farce is hard comedy to write because of the way it has to ramp up. Ford does it perfectly here, while also keeping true to the tone of The Original Series. McCoy explains why he, Sulu, and two Klingons aren\u2019t going to bow to the queen of their captors this way: \u201cYou see, ma\u2019am, these two gentlemen already have a dictator, it\u2019s against Mr. Sulu\u2019s religion\u2026 and I\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d And I can hear DeForest Kelley say that line. Trek is so very rarely good at intentional comedy, and the best it ever got is How Much for Just the Planet?, a book that fills me with joy every time I read it. I own at least three, maybe even five, copies of How Much for Just the Planet? (Several copies are being loaned out.) Every time I see a copy in a bookstore, I buy it. I also own the ebook version. I\u2019m a How Much for Just the Planet? hoarder, and my body will one day be found crushed under a pile of many versions of this single book. I have no regrets.

VLook up #bulletjournal on the social media platform of your choice, and you can feast your eyes on a sea of neatly inked notebook pages designed to track everything from daily to-do lists to inspirational quotes. Go ahead, roll your eyes. But bullet journals are an amazing productivity tool, if you can learn to adapt them to your life. No coloured pens required.  Illustration by Sam Woolley. A bullet journal is just a notebook that accommodates a huge variety of planning schemes. You can create calendars and to-do lists, and you can also use it as a diary, a brainstorming notepad, and more. If you\u2019ve ever bought a planner, but didn\u2019t love the design of the pre-printed pages, the bullet journal is your opportunity to make a planner that fits the way your brain works. The video that launched the bullet journal craze describes a set of conventions that many, but not all, bullet journalers stick to. You create an index to help you find things, a few pages that help you plan the year, and a two-page spread for important dates and tasks for each month. (Many bullet journalers also do a spread for each week.) Then, you write down each day\u2019s plans and events in the form of bulleted lists \u2014 hence the name. As described in that video, most of a bullet journal is just a calendar. The beauty of this hand-written calendar, though, is that you create it as you go, so you always have space for everything else you want to write. Future events go on a long term calendar that comes earlier in the book than today\u2019s page, so every page from today to the end of the book is blank. Here\u2019s how that flexibility pays off. I wrote down my daily list of tasks this morning, and as I was working today, I flipped to the next blank page to brainstorm some ideas for this post. Later in the day, I used the blank page after that to start a checklist for a multi-part project that\u2019s due later this month. Back when I used pre-printed planners, like the PlannerPad, I would have had to grab a second notebook, or a spare sheet of paper, to keep track of these things. The bullet journal approach keeps all my thoughts in one place. The index ties everything together, so you can easily find those notes later. Just leave the first few pages of the notebook blank, and add topics and page numbers for anything you might want to find again. Yes, this may mean hand-numbering the pages, but that\u2019s not a hassle. It only takes a minute to page through the bottom right corner of the notebook and write the odd numbers. Adaptability is another perk to the system: each day doesn\u2019t have to be the same. I plot out my day hour-by-hour if I have a lot of events and appointments that day, but if I just have a few things to get done, I\u2019ll go back to a short bullet list instead.  Another month passed, another tracker filled \U0001f600 You can tell I didn't get much water this month \U0001f605 #bulletjournal #bujo #bujocommunity #bulletjournalcollection #minimalistbujo #planner #monthlyspread #journal #writing #plannerlove #habittracker #bujoinspire A photo posted by Cindy (@refillmyink) on Sep 3, 2016 at 6:51pm PDT  Bullet journalers have expanded this system in hundreds of ways. One popular add-on is a habit tracker, a grid where you can see how often this month you have meditated, or exercised, or flossed. You can also graph your progress toward saving money, make a list of books you want to read, or dedicate a page here and there to doodles. For some people, making the journal beautiful is a hobby. These are the folks who post on Instagram that they\u2019re relaxing with their journal and some coloured pens for a little \u201cme time\u201d at the end of the day.  Today #bulletjournal #bulletjournaljunkies #bujo #bujoaddict #leuchtturm1917 #productivity #coffee #caffeine #storestreetespresso #storestreet #bloomsbury A photo posted by Sian Lewin (@sianlewin) on Sep 8, 2016 at 4:14am PDT  That\u2019s not me. It doesn\u2019t have to be you, either. I use a single, black pen. I don\u2019t take more than about two minutes to set up my page for the day. I sometimes skip a day and don\u2019t feel any guilt about it. And when I asked around, tons of bullet journalers told me that their books are \u201cugly\u201d or \u201cmessy\u201d. Sometimes that means that they\u2019re trying to fill them with pretty art, and judging themselves harshly if they don\u2019t like how it turns out. But many, like me, just have pages of scribbles. What matters is that the scribbles are where we need them, when we need them. I don\u2019t use the yearly calendar from the official instructions. I also forgot to make monthly pages for July and August. But thanks to my daily pages, and the lists and brain dumps I\u2019ve scattered throughout the book, I know exactly what I need to work on today, what\u2019s lingering from last week, and what article ideas I came up with over the last few months that I haven\u2019t written yet. Change the system enough, and some doubters say you aren\u2019t really bullet journaling. If you collect thoughts and memories, maybe it\u2019s really a journal or a commonplace book. If you don\u2019t use the original video\u2019s bullet system, maybe it\u2019s just a DIY planner without a catchy name. In the spirit of adaptability, I\u2019m going to decree that it doesn\u2019t matter what you call it \u2014 you should use the word that helps you the most. If you think of your book as a bullet journal, you\u2019ll look for ideas among bullet journal blogs and communities. Right now, those are a happening place to find inspiration that works for me, so it\u2019s the word I use. On the other hand, if you google \u201cDIY planner\u201d, the ideas that come up are a little bit different: more binders and printables, for example. Use any terms that help you find (and, optionally, share) the ideas you like. If you like keeping track of events and tasks in your phone, there\u2019s no need to stop. In that case, you may wonder what the point of a physical notebook is. In fact, there are tons of reasons why I still swear by a paper journal. First, a paper notebook minimizes distractions. If I pick up my phone to add a note, most of the time I\u2019ll look at my notifications bar, check my email, see if anybody is saying anything interesting on Twitter, look around for pokémon, and then wonder why it was I picked up my phone. If I just need to write down a thought or task, I can do it without distraction in the notebook I keep open on my desk. Handwriting also has its advantages: for example, we may remember things better when we write them rather than type them. It\u2019s also easier to find things sometimes by flipping through recent pages, rather than scrolling endlessly through digital documents. Everyone will have their own preferences here, but I find that I work better, even on the computer, when I have pen and paper at hand. Electronic and paper systems actually complement each other really well. You can write notes in your journal about tasks to do when you\u2019re at a computer (\u201cadd swimming lessons to calendar\u201d) and you can set reminders on your phone to ping you when it\u2019s time to look over your notes and create the next day\u2019s task list. You can also use a system like Evernote to back up your paper journal notes or share them. This is the idea behind the Evernote Moleskine, but you can also just use the app to snap pictures of any old notebook.  Guess who got cute embellishments and cactus erasers for super cheap at Target?! Ugh, I freaking love that store and their one spot where they have super cute stuff for under $5! \U0001f49b\U0001f49b\U0001f49b Also a sneaky peak of my #quoted challenge! I'm trying to write in cursive\u2026 I think my handwriting will forever be obnoxious and just bad\u2026 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 #handwriting #bulletjournal #bujo #target #stationery #stationerylover #super #cute #love #cacti #cactus A photo posted by Nicole (@wannabemage) on Sep 7, 2016 at 3:05pm PDT  Bullet journalers have favourite supplies, which do come in handy but are absolutely not necessary. Here\u2019s what they are, and some alternatives that don\u2019t require you to blow your paycheck at the craft store: A bullet journal doesn\u2019t have to be an art project to be a functional system. That said, it\u2019s totally ok if pretty things motivate you. You\u2019ll want to find your sweet spot, where you don\u2019t feel guilted to decorate, but you still find your planner a handy and happy place to collect your thoughts. And if that means that it\u2019s ugly, enjoy: it works, and it\u2019s all yours.

Image from My Edu Guru Being a student is expensive. You have rent to contend with, tuition fees, textbooks, and then there are all of the freshers\u2019 parties too! All this is made worse by the fact that for a lot of people, this is the first time they will ever have to deal with substantial expenses, and it can be quite a shock to the system. Unfortunately, the picture is even gloomier for international students, as staying in touch with family back home can often be expensive too. Luckily, we are going to provide you with a solution to that problem in this post. While we can\u2019t pay off your student loan, we can make sure keeping in touch with your loved ones is easy and affordable! What options are there for calling overseas? As an international student in the UK, you have various options at your disposal when keeping in touch with your family back home. However, not all of these options are of a good quality. A lot of people keep in touch via Skype, which is great if you\u2019ve got a strong Wi-Fi connection and are at home on the computer. However, it\u2019s not so good when you\u2019re out and about or sharing your network with thousands of other students. Viber is a popular app too, but, unfortunately, ask anyone who has used it regularly and they\u2019ll likely confess that the call quality is not great, and being disconnected every few minutes can become incredibly frustrating, especially when trying to convey important news to your family back home. You then have the option of buying a SIM card that is purpose-built for international calls. You will be able to lock in cheap rates when going down this route, but it can be incredibly frustrating. Do you really want to switch your SIM cards around every time you want to call home? Calling cards are available too, but purchasing them can be a lot more hassle than it\u2019s worth, especially as they are only available in select stores. Instead, you would be much better off going for a call app. The benefits of using a call app With a call app, all you need to do is download it onto your phone, and you can start making international phone calls straight away. You will lock in fantastic rates, just as you would with a call card. However, there is no hassle whatsoever associated with this approach. Once the app is downloaded, you simply follow a few instructions and you are good to go! Moreover, one of the best things about call apps for students is that it is much easier to manage your money. This is because you will top the phone up with credit prior to making a call. When using a SIM card, there is always the chance that you are going to end up with a nasty surprise when your phone bill comes in. The only thing you need to do now is find a quality call app, and luckily you do not need to search far, as FooCall has exactly what you need. With their app, you can make international calls with ease, and their prices are very competitive too. Low costs can often mean low quality with a lot of call apps, but that is not the case with FooCall. This is something you can be sure of because they have a great deal whereby you get your first phone call for free \u2013 you can call anyone, in any location, at any time. This is undoubtedly the best way for students to stay connected with their loved ones. In Association with FooCall Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

p128
V There are a lot of instant messaging apps out there for Android and iOS, none of which differentiate themselves in any hugely significant way. The most interesting is Apple\u2019s revitalised iMessage, set to launch in iOS 10 alongside the new iPhone 7. A new cross-platform app from a Brisbane startup called Amity, though, promises the lion\u2019s share of iMessage\u2019s glossy new features along with real-time features that only activate when two (or more) participants are actively chatting. Amity is brand new, barely a week old. It\u2019s still in beta on Android, with the small eight-person-strong team starting first on iOS and building features into Android as they go. But the bootstrapped team has spent two years developing it, and that\u2019s evident from the diverse set of features it already has.  All the regular unified messaging features are there \u2014 you can have one-on-one or group chats, send photos or video or voice snippets, share your location, and so on. Those aren\u2019t unique, even though the layout makes it easily understandable in the same way that Apple\u2019s iMessage has always boasted. You can even request photos or locations, halfway between a loving thought and MSN Messenger\u2019s goddamn annoying \u2018nudge\u2019  feature from the earlier days of the \u2018net.  But if Amity had a hook, something to draw you in, it would be its various Live Mode extras. When two people are in the same chat window, Amity lets you throw up a high-five that your chat partner can tap to complete \u2014 or they can leave you hanging, if you high-fived without good reason. (You can high-five yourself, though \u2014 which is just about the best thing ever.)  Other Live Mode hooks also take (sometimes heavy) inspiration from various other apps and funnel them into a single app. Like Periscope, you can unleash a stream of live emoji that float to the top of the screen. Like Snapchat\u2019s memories, you can jump through your history to quickly find any link or photo or document that you\u2019ve ever shared. All these work one-on-one or in groups, too.  There\u2019s only one thing that might work against Amity, and that\u2019s the fact that it doesn\u2019t boast any integrated encryption out of the box. With the good work done by Edward Snowden in making people aware of being monitored by the powers that be, and the guys at Open Whisper Systems at providing a chat platform that is secure, it seems like a potential oversight \u2014 but one that\u2019s possible to overcome.  Without the peace of mind that comes from built-in secure messaging features, Amity might quickly become overshadowed by the rising success of from-the-ground-up encrypted apps like Signal, or the massive inertia of mature services like iMessage and Whatsapp. But Amity is new and the team has built an impressive and widely featured app \u2014 we\u2019re excited to see where it might go. [Amity \u2014 iOS / Android]  Problem is iOS users typically just stick with iMessage which is a total pain for others if you aren't in the Apple ecosystem. Not having iMessage access on Android is a pain, not because it is a good messaging app though and it is unlikely to make non Apple users buy an iPhone.\u000aI don't know the backbones of how iMessage message works but I am surprised there isn't a hack to join Android or Windows phones to it. Not sure how they will convince the masses to convert from Whatsapp - it's such a sturdy and easy to use app - I'm sure Whatsapp will incorporate Amity's live chat features anyway if it gets popular enough.

VYeah, we know, your CrossFit gym has completely changed your life, you\u2019ve never looked/felt better, and all other exercise programs pale in comparison. But you may want to ease off the intensive workouts now and then. All that over-exertion can actually impair your immune system, according to a new study just published in Frontiers in Physiology.\u000a CrossFit, for the uninitiated, is a gruelling exercise program combining high-intensity cardio workouts with strength training, organised into circuits. The idea is to complete as many reps as possible in the allotted time, with little to no recovery time, and to vary the workouts constantly so your muscles don\u2019t become too accustomed to any particular exercise. It\u2019s attracted a reasonably sized, extremely vocal and enthusiastic \u2014 and sometimes annoying \u2014 fan base since its introduction in 2000. Even Game of Thrones\u2018 Jon Snow (and world\u2019s worst dinner guest) is a confessed fan: \u201cThe high intensity interval training keeps me in shape for fighting wildlings, while the increased muscle mass helps me defend the seven kingdoms against 16.76m giants.\u201d But there\u2019s a dark side to CrossFit. Too much exercise can be just as harmful to your health as too little. That hardcore culture of \u201cdeplete-endure-repeat\u201d can lead to a rare condition known as Rhabdomyolsis (\u201crhabdo\u201d for short). Basically, extreme exertion can cause muscle cells to explore, leaching proteins into the bloodstream \u2014 a place they really shouldn\u2019t be. The kidneys have to work overtime to remove those proteins, and can become badly damaged. Even if your kidneys recover, your muscles might not ever be the same, because the damaged muscle tissue has been replaced by fatty scar tissue. Do all the military pushups you want, your triceps will still be flabby. Lead author Ramires Tibana doing a CrossFit workout. (Image: Ramires Tibana) The good news is that relatively few CrossFit enthusiasts train hard enough to develop rhabdo. But a team of Brazilian researchers has identified another health risk of over-training: a weakened immune system. The scientists recruited a group of experienced CrossFit enthusiasts to perform two consecutive days of intense workouts, finishing in the fastest time possible. Afterward, they assessed the participants\u2019 muscle power, and levels of metabolic markers and anti-inflammatory proteins produced by white blood cells. They found that too many consecutive CrossFit workouts, with no rest periods, can significantly reduce the number of anti-inflammatory proteins, resulting in a suppressed immune system. On the plus side, the workouts didn\u2019t appear to have much of an adverse effect on overall muscle power. What do these findings mean for your CrossFit habit? \u201cFor non-athlete subjects who want to improve their health and quality of life through CrossFit training, we recommend that they decrease their training volume after two consecutive days of high-intensity training to prevent possible immunosuppression,\u201d lead author Ramires Tibana of the Catholic University of Brasilia said in a statement. \u201cA rest day is important for recovery for subsequent training sessions.\u201d So put down that kettle bell and give yourself a break from your Crossfit regime this weekend. Your body will thank you. And you can hit the gym with renewed gusto the day after. [Frontiers in Physiology] What a bizarre piece of writing. For one thing, it is very common (and old) knowledge that over-training taxes your immune system. It's one of the first things I learned before I joined a gym, and it's why bodybuilders have been taking glutamine since time immemorial. Second thing, why does the author seem to have this strange idea that over-training can only occur via Crossfit? Crossfit is particularly resistant to common, old knowledge about the safest and most efficient ways to train. He targeted crossfit because one of the fundamental tenets of CF is to reject all the knowledge bodybuilders and sports scientists have built up since time immemorial. They regularly eschew proper periodised or even cycled programs for completly randomised 'programs' that overload people's systems.  Yes, people overtrain in other activities. The problem is that crossfit is actively promoting this overtraining attitude and causing injuries.  The one group to benefit from crossfit? Physios. They love the business they get when a CF gym opens up nearby.

VSlogging through an overflowing inbox is one of the hardest parts about returning from vacation, or any time out of the office. Get through your email faster by reading it in \u201clast in, first out\u201d order. Often the issues cluttering your inbox are figured out by the time you return, so reading the most recent emails first helps you see which items still need your immediate attention.\u000a Image from centralasian. Of course, you\u2019ll often need to read a whole thread to get context or other key information, but by checking the last email first, you can see if it is something to address now or save to catch up on later.

V\u000aTech Digest\u2019s Chris Price visited Bosch\u2019s recently opened Research and Development Facility near Stuttgart, Germany to see how the latest sensors are shaping the Internet of Things (iOT) revolution Think Bosch and what comes to mind? Probably one of the company\u2019s dishwashers or maybe its range of popular power tools.\u000aBut actually the German company, founded in 1886 by engineer and philanthropist Dr Robert Bosch, is a huge worldwide organisation with a turnover of nearly \u20ac50 billion, much of it derived from devices you never even see. Take the humble smartphone, for example. Around three quarters of these devices across the world are fitted with one of Bosch\u2019s tiny MEMS (micro-electro mechanical systems) accelerometer sensors. Despite measuring just 2.5mm x 3mm, these sensors work by detecting the earth\u2019s gravity and are responsible for functions such as flipping the mobile phone\u2019s screen from portrait to landscape mode, or for the functions within the device\u2019s pedometer to count the number of steps we take each day. Similarly these tiny sensors not much bigger than the end of a ballpoint pen are also used in fitness trackers, augmented reality glasses and other wearables. Automotive sensors Nor is it just inside consumer electronics devices where the clever little sensors are playing an important role. Nearly two thirds of Bosch\u2019s business is based around the automotive industry, providing sensors primarily to car manufacturers for all the latest ESP (Electronic Safety Program) features. In vehicles, the MEMS sensors can identify potentially dangerous situations, such as the car suddenly braking or rolling over, and will help to keep the vehicle on the road or deploy its airbags. Since the start of production in 1995, Bosch has manufactured an astonishing 6 billion of these tiny devices. However, this is just the beginning. With the Internet of Things (iOT) revolution, virtually every device we own will be connected to the internet. Statistics from Cisco show the number of internet connected devices has already exceeded the number of people on the planet and is expected to reach 25 billion items by the end of this year and 50 billion in 2020! \u201cIn the future, nearly all everyday objects are likely to be equipped with sensors,\u201d says Dr. Franz Lärmer, a Bosch sensor expert who in 2007 won European Inventor of the Year from the European Patent Office for his work on etching silicon which helped pave way for more compact and advanced sensors. \u201cThis is a revolutionary development that will allow almost every object to gather information about itself and its environment. As a result, the potential applications of these objects will increase tremendously.\u201d MEMS sensors coming off the production line. Sinceproduction began in 1995, Bosch has made 5 billion MEMS sensors. Currently 4 million of these sensors are manufactured each day. Connected planet One example is with fitness or medical trackers where several sensors can be combined to provide a complete profile about the user for diagnostics purposes. Using an atmospheric sensor it\u2019s possible to detect what floor the user is on while data sensors attached to the skin monitor can be used to monitor heart rate and movement. By combining this information from the sensors, it\u2019s possible to detect changes in heart frequency when climbing the stairs and use this information for medical diagnostics. \u201cChanges in how people move can be an early sign of dementia or postural defects,\u201d explains Lärmer. \u201cThere is no end in sight to the wide range of possible applications for connected sensors.\u201d Last week saw German Chancellor Angela Merkel open Bosch\u2019s latest R&D facility in Renningen, near Stuttgart where new developments in how these sensors can be used is just one of the major pushes of the company\u2019s research. Costing around \u20ac300 million Euros to build over a period of around two years and creating 1700 jobs, the Renningen facility has been designed as a creative hub along the lines of an American University such as Stanford or Carnegie Mellon. Three thousand experts across the Bosch group are now working on iOT alone and Bosch sees huge business potential in the services that will arise as a result from this connectivity. \u201cIf we do not want to let others seize these opportunities, then we have to be even faster and less risk-averse than before,\u201d Dr Volkmar Denner, Chairman of the Board at Bosch told journalists at the official opening of the facility. \u201cAt an earlier stage than ever before, our engineers have to think like business people. The things that are technically feasible should not only excite our researchers, but our future customers as well.\u201d Grey sky thinking. On the 12th Floor known as \u2018Platform 12\u2019 overlooking Bosch\u2019s test track, employees draw in markers on the windows to express their creativity and hopefully come up with some potential product ideas. Start up mentality To foster this spirit of creativity and entrepreneurship there\u2019s even a special floor at Renningen known as \u2018Platform 12\u2019 where staff are encouraged to come up with new and interesting applications for the technologies they develop within a much more creative environment. Their work will focus on areas such as software engineering, sensor technology, automation, driver assistance systems, and battery technology, as well as on improved automotive powertrain systems.  Bosch has also set up its own incubator platform for new businesses within the campus along the lines of the Silicon Valley model (Bosch also has a R&D facility in Palo Alto in California which is close to companies like Google). At Renningen the plan is that potential new products will be quickly identified with the company looking after the day-to-day tasks such as premises, financing, and other administrative tasks so its founders can focus on building the product and bringing it to market.\u000aIn the spirit of US innovation, Bosch is even prepared for failure, although in true efficient German style the startups should \u201cfail quickly and cheaply\u201d according to Bosch\u2019s Michael Bolle, President, Corporate Research and Development at Bosch. Separately, it has also acquired companies from outside the group to bring into the growing organisation. In August Bosch bought California-based company Seeo Inc which has developed next-generation lithium-ion batteries that could double the range of electric cars. Whereas traditional battery packs use electrochemical energy storage which become less safe or reliable the more powerful they are, Seeo batteries are based on non-reactive solid polymer electrolytes, which are apparently less prone to the flaws that affect current-generation cylindrical and prismatic lithium-ion batteries. \u2018Look Mum, no hands\u2019. Bosch demonstrated automated driving to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Automated vehicles One area that is particularly important for Bosch is automated driving. Bosch was test driving its own highly automated vehicle on the Freeway in Palo Alto just two months after the Google Car and has also been test driving automated cars on the German A81. At first these tests took place in vehicles based on the BMW 3 Series Touring cars but more recently in the Tesla Model S. Says Dr Dirk Hoheisel, member of the board of management at Bosch: \u201cOur engineers have now completed more than 10,000 kilometres of test drives without a hitch.\u201d Indeed it was this same technology which was demonstrated recently to German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the launch of the Renningen R&D facility, although sadly she didn\u2019t get behind the wheel of the car herself (there is also a test track at Renningen.) \u201cWe see automated driving as an important trend in reducing fatal traffic accidents,\u201d says Bosch\u2019s Dr Volkmar Denner. \u201cOver 500 pedestrians died in road traffic accidents in Germany last year.\u201d However, it\u2019s likely to be several years before we will see these fully automated vehicles come to European roads because of regulatory restrictions (see here for more information). In addition to working on completely automated driving technologies, Bosch is also a leading developer in driver assistance systems which are becoming increasingly commonplace especially in high end vehicles. Using these technologies the car will, for example, automatically steer out of the way if a pedestrian steps out into the road or if there\u2019s obstacle blocking the route.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel is shown the Bonirob \u2013 a robot that can sift weeds from plants  Nor is it just driving where automated vehicles and machinery can play a role. One of the first incubation companies within Bosch\u2019s start up environment is Deepfield Robotics which has developed an agricultural robot called the \u2018Bonirob\u2019. About the size of a compact car, the Bonirob is able to combine sensor technology with algorithms and image recognition to automatically get rid of weeds without the need for potentially dangerous herbicides. It works by learning to distinguish between crops and weeds and gets rids of weeds mechanically with the help of a rod. Explains Professor Amos Albert, a robotics expert and general manager at of Deepfield Robotics: \u201cOver time, based on parameters such as leaf colour, shape and size, Bonirob learns to differentiate more and more accurately between the plants we want and the plants we don\u2019t want.\u201d Although still in test phase and very expensive (around \u20ac250,000) it\u2019s expected the Bonirob will go into production in the next few years with the eventual cost to farmers around the same as that of an average tractor (around \u20ac50,000). Until then if it\u2019s robotics you\u2019re after then you\u2019ll have to invest around £1300 on the next best thing: a Bosch Indego robotic lawn mower. It won\u2019t get the weeds out of the ground but it should at least give the grass a nice trim so you can enjoy the garden without having to break your back mowing the lawn!

VMylan Pharmaceuticals, the makers of the EpiPen, spent the past decade making sure that its life-saving allergy product was in as many US public schools as possible. But the company has come under fire in recent weeks for raising the price of the drug from roughly $US57 ($75) in 2007 to about $US600 ($791) today \u2014 all for about $1 worth of medicine. Now the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office is investigating whether Mylan broke antitrust laws in the contracts it made with schools.\u000a\u000a(Photo Illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) At issue is whether Mylan might have \u201cinserted potentially anticompetitive terms\u201d into the contracts it signed with school systems throughout New York state, according to the NY Attorney General. Roughly 65,000 schools across the United States are believed to have contracts with Mylan. Mylan did not immediately return a request for comment. There have been allegations that some contracts signed with Mylan and its free EpiPen distribution program for schools may have included terms that prohibited participating schools from buying the products of competitors in the future. Those allegations have yet to be substantiated but are likely to be investigated by Congress and the FTC soon. For now, the New York Attorney General seems to be the one making the first steps to substantially investigate Mylan\u2019s allegedly anticompetitive practices. \u201cNo child\u2019s life should be put at risk because a parent, school, or healthcare provider cannot afford a simple, life-saving device because of a drug-maker\u2019s anti-competitive practices,\u201d New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said in a statement released today. \u201cIf Mylan engaged in anti-competitive business practices, or violated antitrust laws with the intent and effect of limiting lower cost competition, we will hold them accountable,\u201d Schneiderman continued. \u201cAllergy sufferers have enough concerns to worry about \u2014 the availability of life-saving medical treatment should not be one of them. I will bring the full resources of my office to this critical investigation.\u201d

VTo navigate snowy roads, Ford autonomous vehicles are equipped with high-resolution 3D maps Autonomous vehicles are all very well. But at the moment they are only able to cope with certain weather conditions. Unlike human beings, automated vehicles relying on internet-connected road sensors are unable to see the road or what\u2019s around them when everything is covered in a  blanket of snow. That is until now. Because Ford claims to be the first car maker to test autonomous vehicles in snow-covered environments. In order to navigate its snowy roads, the autonomous vehicles are equipped with high-resolution 3D maps, complete with information about the road and what\u2019s around it. This includes road markings, signs, geography, landmarks and topography. This allows the vehicle to position itself and understand what is around it even when snow is covering the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for a car to drive itself in perfect weather,\u201d said Jim McBride, Ford technical leader for autonomous vehicles. \u201cIt\u2019s quite another to do so when the car\u2019s sensors can\u2019t see the road because it\u2019s covered in snow. Weather isn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re testing autonomous vehicles in wintry conditions \u2013 for the roughly 70 percent of U.S. residents who live in snowy regions.\u201d Taking place in Michigan, including at Mcity (a 32-acre, full-scale simulated real-world urban environment at the University of Michigan), the winter testing uses bespoke, high-resolution 3D maps created especially for Ford. \u201cMaps developed by other companies don\u2019t always work in snow-covered landscapes,\u201d said Ryan Eustice, associate professor at University of Michigan college of engineering. \u201cThe maps we created with Ford contain useful information about the 3D environment around the car, allowing the vehicle to localise even with a blanket of snow covering the ground.\u201d An autonomous vehicle creates the maps while driving the test environment in favorable weather, with technologies automatically annotating features like traffic signs, trees and buildings. However, when the vehicle can\u2019t see the ground, it detects above-ground landmarks to pinpoint itself on the map, and then subsequently uses the map to drive successfully in inclement conditions. \u201cThe vehicle\u2019s normal safety systems, like electronic stability control and traction control, which often are used on slippery winter roads, work in unison with the autonomous driving software,\u201d said McBride. \u201cWe eventually want our autonomous vehicles to detect deteriorating conditions, decide whether it\u2019s safe to keep driving, and if so, for how long.\u201d You can see a video of Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicle test in the snow here:  Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VThe White House has named Gregory Touhill to a new role designed to lead the charge against cyber-threats. Touhill will be the first-ever Chief Information Security Officer, the Obama Administration announced today, and will lead a team \u201cwho have been at the forefront of driving policy and implementation of leading cyber practices across federal agencies.\u201d\u000a After 21 years in the Air Force, Touhill filled other high ranking government positions doing cybersecurity work and eventually landed at the Department of Homeland Security. The addition of Touhill\u2019s new position reflects the Obama administration\u2019s increased focus on cybersecurity, which has become a necessary move as sophisticated hacks by powerful nation states increase. The Obama Administration has definitely beefed up its cybersecurity staff, but that hasn\u2019t stopped devastating hacks in other areas of the federal government, like the Office of Personnel Management and the IRS. This job is a presidential appointment, so this guy could be replaced by a new cybersecurity expert once Donald \u201cCyber Is So Big\u201d Trump or Hillary \u201cExtremely Careless\u201d Clinton takes office. But hey, at least he\u2019s got this badass Facebook cover image. Beautiful choice, Gregory. [Reuters]

VWhen you\u2019re trying to sell your home, you want to squeeze as much value out of it as you can. Some upgrades, like a kitchen remodel, can maximise your value, but they\u2019re also time-consuming and expensive. Here are a few simpler, cheaper upgrades you can make.\u000a Photo by waferboard\u000a Over at Credit.com, writer Sheiresa Ngo lists a number of inexpensive ways to boost your home\u2019s value. Doorknobs, for example, are easy enough to swap out and they can make a big difference (it\u2019s one of the first things I swapped out when I bought my home). That goes for cabinet and drawer handles, too. Ngo offers a suggestion for picking out the right knobs: \u000aHome renovation expert Brittany Cramer said one thing you should keep in mind when updating door knobs is the home\u2019s era. \u201cOne of my favourite pieces of advice to give folks is to consider the era of the home before purchasing and installing accessories. You might be a lover of that wrought iron, Tuscan look, but will that style suit your home?\u201d said Cramer.\u000a Lighting is another area that can make a huge difference, and while light fixtures can get pricey, the payoff might be worth it if your current fixtures are really outdated. Paint, of course, can completely change a room, too. You do, however, want to make sure to pick the right colours. Ngo offers some additional insight, so be sure to check out her full post at the link below. 4 Inexpensive Ways to Boost Your Home\u2019s Value [Credit.com] Or just do a really thorough spring clean.

VNintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto appeared on stage at today\u2019s Apple Event to announce the introduction of Super Mario to the iPhone.\u000a\u000aSuper Mario Run appears to be a Temple Run-style platform game, Nintendo\u2019s first proper game that doesn\u2019t run on one of its console platforms. The company previously announced plans for iOS games back in April. In addition to the single player mode, where players jump and dash to over come obstacles and collect coins, there\u2019s also a battle mode to play against friends and strangers with wins dependent on number of coins collected and turtles \u201cimpressed\u201d. Going with a runner makes sense for Nintendo. It\u2019s known for games that play very well and have great controls, and it\u2019s traditional platformers just do not transfer well to a touch screen, as anyone who has used a SNES or NES emulator can attest. Super Mario Run will be available by the holiday season of 2016, but no date, or specific pricing has been made available.

VIt\u2019s official. Tim Cook himself got up on stage and introduced Phil Schiller who presented the iPhone 7, sans 3.5mm audio jack. In its place we got something much better: freedom.  Of course I don\u2019t mean freedom in a Braveheart sense, or the release-from-prison-after-a-decade-of-incarceration kind of freedom. Instead, Apple has paved the way \u2014 once again \u2014 for the direction that the consumer electronics industry is sure to follow. The lack of headphone jack on the iPhone 7 is met equally with the release of new, wireless AirPods \u2014 with a rated battery life of 24 hours and sound quality that\u2019s said to be as good as the current, wired EarPods that ship with the iPhone 6S.  AirPods is a play on words between the Macbook Air and the EarPods that have been shipping with iPhones for several years. In addition, the wireless AirPods \u2014 powered by a custom-made Apple W1 wireless chip \u2014 include integrated beamforming microphones, so you can use them for phone calls and interact with Siri. The W1 chip appears to be the custom chip that\u2019s been rumoured to be in development by Apple that allows both high fidelity playback and standout power efficiency using the existing Bluetooth standard.  Before you butt in and educate us about all the previously existing wireless headphones on the market, let\u2019s look at previous occasions where Apple has done something similar and the effect it had. Starting in 2007, the iPhone was the first major cell phone release to feature a virtual keyboard rather than fixed-feature physical keyboards which were the norm. The iPhone was met with fanfare and it\u2019s difficult to comprehend a smartphone today without a capacitive virtual keyboard.  In 2011, the iPad was released and many \u2014 if not the majority of \u2014 people declared it a flop and merely \u201can oversized iPod Touch\u201d. After many millions of iPads, Samsung Galaxy Notes and other tablet PCs later, it\u2019s plain to see that the tablet form factor works, it\u2019s popular and it was enough of a disruptor to have most major PC vendors follow up with their own version. Firewire was dropped before USB 3.0 was a thing.  Optical Drives started dropping off when the Macbook Air was announced, followed closely by the desktop iMac after it. Ethernet ports haven\u2019t been seen on Apple laptops for several years. None of these are missed and they\u2019ve allowed features such as Taptic engines, co-processors, bigger batteries and thinner form factors to take their place and rightly so.  Apple is very effective in reducing the clutter in users\u2019 lives, stripping back as much as possible to serve up only what is needed and not necessarily what everyone wants. As thoroughly chronicled, Apple lives by \u2018skating to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been\u2019 and it\u2019s this logic \u2014 this forward-thinking mentality \u2014 that pushes new technologies and fewer distraction onto consumers (and professionals) in ways that may not make sense at the time but come into their own with a little bit of patience.  Lack of optical drives, new Lightning cables, USB Type-C ports, Thunderbolt cables and voice-based assistants a la Siri all came to the mass market with Apple\u2019s help. It can be argued that if Apple didn\u2019t bet the boat on these technologies, they wouldn\u2019t be mainstream today. It\u2019s brave, it\u2019s bold and given its likely success, will push other makers to develop improved wireless headphones themselves and once again give consumers greater buyer power.  It\u2019ll likely be further down the line that the public gains the clarity to see the genius behind these moves and certainly when their favourite PC vendors release a similar product; they\u2019ll have no choice but to agree with the move. The question now is what competitors will bring out to keep up with Apple. To answer the question, Apple\u2019s lightning connector has proven itself more than capable of transmitting power to and from the iPhone for such uses as noise-cancelling earphones, powered speakers and other hardware.  It\u2019s this interface that\u2019s ideally suited to take over the role of a singular, analogue interface, which has been around for too many decades. People are afraid of change and that\u2019s evident in many of the shifts done in the past but there\u2019s a self-correction as time goes on and we, as users will benefit from it overall.  They should have been designed with a tether that can clip on and off so you can connect the 2 together for those of us who find apple earpods fall out constantly. Maybe it will be an aftermarket accessory or something. Seeing all bluetooth-enabled phones could use wireless ear buds removing the jack from the iphone doesn't provide anything new. It just means that the phone cannot easily be backward compatible with generations of existing accessories. Tell Apple me didn't do it to save money on building iphones and then being able to charge more for ear buds. I've always felt that 3.5 Jack has been holding back all technology developers that deal with audio.  And when it's so prevalent it's always going to be hard trying to improve an old technology and still support older technologies.\u000aWhere space is a premium replacing older bulkier technologies should always trump.\u000aThe only reservations with using lightning connector is you can't listen to music while the phone is charging.\u000aWireless earpods would resolve that, but $159 is a pretty steep price for that solution.  I'd be too worried they'd fall out while walking into the street (or into a rainwater grate!). I hope they are robust. Tell me, exactly what new innovations are possible now that the headphone jack is gone? Wireless headphones and audio over lightning were already a thing. "replacing older bulkier technologies"  - with what, a vibrating home button? be still my heart. They moved the DAC & amp out of the phone to save space - but now they just have to be built into every pair of headphones & dongle adapters instead. How is that an improvement?  Why not halve the size of the battery too, make the phone super-slim? People can just carry around a battery pack if they really need that extra juice, right? Someone please make a lightning to 3 button mic to 3.5. Shiz will sell to everyone with a decent set of wired cans. Keep your phone end of cord adapter that'll bulk up my pocket and more likely break from stress away. apple ear pieces are so terribly designed that you have to rely on the cable to not lose them, they fall out and are uncomfortable as hell, now when they fall out you have to shell out... lets be conservative about it ... $100? for replacements? $229 according to the "Apple's AirPods Are The Tiny Wireless Earbuds Of The Future" article!\u000aOh, and they don't come with the iPhone 7, they are just an accessory. Instead you get Lightning EarPods and a Lightning Headphone adapter. So good luck ever seeing AirPods in the wild. \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 8:21 am								 Well fuck that. They seem cool but I'll stick with other bluetooth ones for under 100 LOL, I spat my coffee with your comment!\u000aAccording to Gizmodo $229 is reasonable for headphones, so don't worry if you lose them... just pony up $229 very alternate weekend!  If this was not Apple, it would have been put over the coals for being poorly thought out, poorly implemented, unnecessary additional expense, need to carry a charging case, not as stable as wired phones, too expensive for any practical application.  Eg....  MS Continuum.  Dang I love Gizmodo's fanboiiiiizm.... you really can't take them seriously anymore and accept their posts as opinion pieces only in lieu of tech journalism. "Starting in 2007, the iPhone was the first major cell phone release to feature a virtual keyboard rather than fixed-feature physical keyboards".\u000aReally??? Who wrote this must be a fan boy cause it's just not the truth. Do some research before you sprout this nonsense. It's nonsense of course, but "first major cell phone" just means everyone who isn't Apple isn't major enough. So... can you charge the phone and listen to music via wired (ie good) headphones at the same time? No? This configuration has a loss of functionality that nobody seems to be keen to discuss. By the way, I still use a corded mouse/keyboard on my PC, because I don't like feeding things batteries or the hassle of charging everything I touch every day. Wired Ethernet is faster and more reliable. Wireless gives "freedom" but at a cost - it is not automatically better. I think Apple have made a big mistake here. I still use a corded mouse/keyboard on my PC, because I don't like feeding things batteries or the hassle of charging everything I touch every day This is my thing, too. Me too a rated battery life of 24 hours Gizmodo's other article, "Apple's AirPods Are The Tiny Wireless Earbuds Of The Future" says the AirPod's have 5 hours charge while their charging station has 25 hours. So which is it? Both... kinda.  The airbuds last for 5 hours on a single charge.  However, the case they come with is a portable battery that has 20 hours of battery life.  So, 15 minutes in the box will give you 3 hours battery life.\u000aSo you'll have 25 hours of battery life but it's not continuous usage. Just another adapter I have to use and a new pair of wireless ear buds to go missing (and replaced by apple at a exorbitant cost.)\u000aSeriously the current IPhone already comes with both a WiFi and Bluetooth module, there is no reason they needed to remove the headphone jack to make wireless headphones work with the new device, why could it not just be an option? I still use wired mouse & keyboard. I hate pissfarting around with batteries & chargers. I see a lot of good features and I'm excited for the new bluetooth innovation from 3rd party providers that this will force the market to do but god damn this article reads like the author was actually fondling themself while writing it Well if this article isn't the most ridiculous piece of fanboyism.\u000aAs others have said this move by apple causes a loss of functionality and is done so Apple can price gouge people on wireless headphones.\u000aHeadphones that apple say sound as good as their wired ones? Not hard considering the rubbish quality of the  wired ones.\u000aAlso those ones never stay in my ears and these look like they will be worse.\u000aAnd yeap forget about charging and listening at the same time.\u000aFinally the wireless headphones i have used in the past have issues with interference. Use at the gym or on a run? Fine. Use walking down he street and they barely work.\u000aSo no this isn't some magically awesome move by apple that shows how far ahead of the curve they are.\u000aThis is worse for consumers. Will it cost them sales? Who knows. But I'm definitely not interested in upgrading for a while now. I was going to post the same thing. I cannot see this being a good move for Apple. I have never been so underwhelmed after an Apple iPhone event. In fairness I don't think it's just apple. There has been no phone launch this year that has really got me interested.\u000aHowever, that could be me because Samsung are probably apple's biggest competitor but the problems I had with my S5 really put me off them so I have no real interest in their phones anymore. And yeap forget about charging and listening at the same time. This. Apple is not "innovating" here. It would be innovation if they unveiled wireless iphone charging at the same time. The microsoft lumia 950 already has that, because its unpopular, people dont know that wireless charging and wireless headphones can be used at the same time Giz. simply ignores anything Microsoft and froths at the mouth over the lustful fruit... No news here. I don't often bother saying something, but in this case, come on Chris. Really? Virtual keyboards? Optical drives? USB-C? None of those things happened because of Apple.  Virtual Keyboards have been around since PDAs in the 90s. It took decent, CHEAP Capacitive touchscreens to make them useful. Apple leveraged them first is all. Disc Drives disappeared because the internet sped up. The amount of discs used by Apple Laptop users compared with PC laptops is miniscule and made 0 difference. It was removed from Apple to make stuff thin. That was it. The industry moved to drop disc Drives several years later once they were ready. USB-C was designed as a USB-A replacement which always take several cycles of hardware to flow through. Apple have the advantage of only having 3 pieces of hardware that actually use USB (AirBook, MacBook and Mac) which makes it easy to change hardware. Try doing it with 32 different hardware combinations in a single laptop alone like Dell or Acer. Now they're forcing Bluetooth headphone usage for their phone. Bluetooth headphones which have had a mature market for 3-5 years. They're just removing something because it's something to differentiate. That isn't bad, nor necessarily good. It's just what they've chosen. There is nothing wrong with the 3.5mm jack and its been around decades longer than Apple. Them getting rid of it won't do squat to the industries that use it. Apple have had a large impact on the electronics industry. But they are FAR from the only impact and this is one of those times it'll be a wimper, not a shout. We dont get many Android or Apple fanboi articles that much anymore. But this is, unfortunately, an exception. so true, although we might see less of these articals from apple fanoys as 10 of my friends are apple fanboys and they all say the wireless earphone thing is a shitty move those earphones are going to go missing all the time.... also I bet they will have shit battery life I, for one, welcome our new wireless overlords. Ethernet ports haven\u2019t been seen on Apple laptops for several years. None of these are missed who wrote this lol everyone i know with an apple laptop hates all the dongles required to use the damn thing Agreed. I miss the Ethernet port... Ever try imaging 100+ MacBooks with only 5 dongles.  At our school we need to have enough of each dongle available for borrowing or our IT dept use. Such a pain when yet another one is needed! Apple lives by \u2018skating to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been\u2019 and it\u2019s this logic \u2014 this forward-thinking mentality \u2014 that pushes new technologies and fewer distraction onto consumers (and professionals) in ways that may not make sense at the time but come into their own with a little bit of patience. this is the most ridiculous thing i have read in ages there have been wireless earbuds for ages now and other phones have tried to remove the 3.5mm jack but it didnt change anything and lastly removing the home button its about time they caught up i havent had an actual home button on my phone since my htc nexus 1 in the past yes apple was innovative and doing something no one else did now they just copy everyone else and say its the next big thing yes it might be but your a bit late apple This article was clearly typed by Chris's raging fan boy boner, and the blood loss to his brain shows through. If you seriously think this incremental update and the loss of functionality by removing the headphone jack is "revolutionary" you're a nut job and you shouldn't be writing for a tech blog... probably not even a local news paper tech column. What a joke. i know a fanboy and said he likes wired accesories. fail for apple

p150
VApple announced its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and Watch Series 2 yesterday at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. For most iPhone 6s owners, the improvements will not be compelling enough to prompt an immediate upgrade. What we are increasingly seeing is greater sophistication being brought to the software that runs on mobile devices, rather than the devices themselves. In short, Apple\u2019s new devices confirm we are at \u201cpeak mobile\u201d \u2014 nowadays, it\u2019s the software that counts. What the event confirmed  was that the leaks about the phone and the watch have gotten to the point that there were very few surprises. The new features of the phones can best be seen in Apple\u2019s comparison chart which is interesting from the perspective of how much is the same between the 6S and the 7. For people who have an iPhone 6S, there is little in the new phones that would be compelling enough to upgrade. The phone is slightly faster, the battery will last a little longer (a claimed 2 hours extra) and the camera slightly better. There are a couple of new colours and the phone now comes in a version with more memory (256 GB). The phones are now dustproof and \u201csplashproof\u201d. Physically, the biggest changes are the disappearance of the headphone jack and the replacement of the movable home button with a fixed trackpad-like device with \u201ctaptic\u201d feedback. The new phones will come with earbuds that have a Lightning connector. An adaptor will be included to convert the old jack to the Lightning style and new wireless AirPods will come as an optional accessory item. The bigger changes came with the new Series 2 Apple Watch. Again, not in terms of design or new physical features but that it is now waterproof and can be worn whilst swimming. There is a GPS chip on the Series 2 watch now as well which allows the device to track runs and give directions without needing to use the phone. The new system chip that is available in the Series 2 Watch will be available in the older style Series 1 Watch which will continued to be sold. Again, there are general upgrades for power, graphics, screen, and processor speeds. What we have seen with the new device announcements is the same thing that has happened in the case of tablets and PCs generally. There is very little that will change with the physical appearance of the mobile devices we use from year to year. Each year they will get a little better and if customers happen to be at the point of their device upgrade cycle that warrants a new phone, they will upgrade, but otherwise, there will be little to distinguish one year\u2019s devices from the next. What is happening however is that the capabilities of the software that comes with the phone is continually improving and this is going to be more significant in the end. The bigger step change has come with the new versions of iOS and WatchOS and the features that were announced at the  annual developers conference in June of this year. Enhancements to the capabilities of Siri for example and its availability to app developers is a big step because it will increasingly bring new forms of intelligence and interactivity to apps that we use on our mobile devices. What we are increasingly seeing is greater sophistication being brought to the software that runs on mobile devices that are transforming them into personal health, research, education and financial platforms without the need for new sensors or other hardware. Where hardware in the form of new sensors is needed, they can be added as separate devices rather than needing to be built into a watch of phone. iOS 10 and WatchOS 3 will be available for download and installation on the 16th September. Apple will continue to do well from sales of the new devices. It will do little to stem the diminishing overall market share to Android however as that is being driven by the massive range of capable, and cheaper, smart phones coming out from other manufacturers. From a stock market perspective, the leaks on the new devices had already been \u201cpriced in\u201d to the current share price and so this barely moved on the announcements of the new devices. For people with an iPhone 5 or iPhone 5S, the answer would be a categorical yes. For those with an iPhone 6 or 6S, no, not unless your phones were really in need of replacement. For Apple Watch users, again, probably not worth upgrading unless you are a swimmer and want to wear the watch in a pool, or simply can\u2019t shower unless you have a watch on. Of course, for those that upgrade devices each year, Apple has obliged by providing something new to buy and they can always use the excuse that their old devices will go to another family member or friend. Pre-orders for the phones and watches begins on the 9th September and devices will ship on the 16th September.  David Glance is the Director of UWA Centre for Software Practice at the University of Western Australia. This article was originally published on The Conversation. The Samsung Edge phones show that we haven't reached peak smartphone design yet, there are still ways to get around the stagnant "flat screen slate" design that is so common these days.  Apple are reportedly working on a complete redesign for next year too so it will be exciting to see what they come up with. i'm with @dazzler3622 - just because apple dropped the ball this year, doesn't mean the rest of the manufacturers will slack off. There are advancements being made in battery, screen and storage. Heck 5G is round the corner and VR is upon us. The article should read - with iPhone7, we (Apple) have reached Peak. Just wait till Apple bring out an exploding battery and put a patent on it. would sell well in certain markets. I reckon it's not that we've reached peak mobile - instead we've reached peak Apple mobile. There was no innovation in this generation whatsoever besides water resistance & that's been around for years now. What Apple has done is to force 3rd parties in the industry to innovate & develop newer & better bluetooth products. Apple can reach a higher "peak" by introducing wireless charging and enable connectivity to other devices in a similar manner. I can envision the next "innovation" to do away with lightning adaptor altogether. There are lots of features some phones already have that the iPhone doesn't have, and some that no phone has. All of which at some stage could be added.\u000aWhat they need to do is pack a bunch in the next phone giving it a massive slate of new features. The problem comes with the 12-month release cycle is that if they blow all their ideas in one year, then there is nothing for the next year. - Wireless charging\u000a- 3D display, without glasses.\u000a- 3D video recording and photos\u000a- Totally new battery technology\u000a- No physical buttons, or sockets. totally wireless and sealed.\u000a- OLED\u000a- Flexible\u000a- Environmental sensors\u000a- Health sensors\u000a- Built-in projector\u000a- Face & Iris recognition\u000a- Software sim card\u000a- Digital radio This is a great article and it's spot on. Yeah, the Samsung looks nicer, but that's not what the author is talking about.  The author is commenting on CPU, GPU and hardware features.\u000aApple's response this time around was disappointing. A better camera, waterproofing, better battery life. But, what's new? Nothing really.  What was new in the Samsung s7? Not much, unless you only worry about the look.\u000aThe software will most probably drive most of the innovation for at least the next few years.\u000aJokes about batteries and Apple aesthetics aside, I believe the author to be spot on. Innovative hardware in phones won't be coming thick and fast like it was over the last 10 years.

VDelicious mochi prides itself on being soft and chewy. Making such mochi is normally a laborious, violent, and rather dangerous process. This homemade mochi ice cream recipe doesn\u2019t require any risky pounding or slapping though; just sweet glutinous rice flour, sugar, water, ice cream, and a can-do attitude.  Image by Mr Bronsky. Food52 recommends that you pre-scoop balls of ice cream to later stuff inside the mochi wrapping. The easiest way to ensure uniformity is to take an egg carton, line it with plastic wrap, and place your ice cream scoops in each cradle. About the size of a ping pong ball should be ok. Meanwhile, to make the mochi you add together sweet glutinous rice and sugar, then water, and whisk altogether into a slurry. The next part requires heating up the mixture in the microwave in quick intervals and stirring in-between. The goal is to make it look translucent. And the fun part begins after it\u2019s cooled: it should start to resemble the pinchable softness of mochi, at which point you cut it into circles and get that ice cream up in there. Don\u2019t pop them in your mouth just yet. They need to freeze for a couple of hours and then thawed before bliss happens. Mochi Ice Cream [Food52]

The name is actually the feminine form of Herman, and reached peak popularity at the turn of last century. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration it is pronounced her-MEEN. Hermine has appeared on NOAA\u2019s list of potential storm names since the permanent naming scheme was developed in 1979. The lists of storm names are rotated out every year, with one being repeated on the seventh year. There are six lists total, so Hermine has only been used five times in the last 37 years. If the name isn\u2019t retired this year we\u2019ll be visited again by Hermine in 2022. And hopefully by then NOAA, and the World Meteorological Organisation, which acts as keeper of the name list, will be able to explain why they so badly misspelled Hermione.

If you took one look at that jumble of textiles and saw The King of Pop, I\u2019m here to burst your bubble. Behold, the power of pareidolia. Faces on Mars, Elvis in your potato chips, Jesus on your toast. We see faces everywhere they aren\u2019t, and we have our non-sceptical brains to thank. If life was The X-Files, our brains would be Mulder. Our brains are this guy.  They want to believe. And in this case, it\u2019s in faces. Faces in everything.  When we see an object, our brains try to make sense of it \u2014 quickly. In order to get it done \u2014 fast \u2014 skepticism doesn\u2019t play a big role. Our brains effectively take the path of least resistance, trying to recognise familiar shapes even in unfamiliar objects. It makes perfect sense when you realise that literally everything you see is light patterns patterns falling on your retina. It\u2019s only when what we see is communicated to other parts of the brain we start to try and make sense of it \u2014 and we are more likely to match those patterns up with recognisable objects, things we have seen before.  Our life experiences provide \u201ctemplates\u201d for what we are hard-wired to recognise \u2014 like certain faces. If you worship the Virgin Mary she\u2019s more likely to show up in the rising damp of your apartment wall. An if you\u2019re a fan of Michael Jackson, well, you\u2019re likely following his daughter\u2019s instagram account. Amazingly, pareidolia is not even a human-only trait \u2014 pareidolia has been recreated using Google Maps, tracking down humanoid-like qualities on the surface on the Earth.  Pareidolia also comes in auditory versions \u2014 the whole \u201cwhen you play this tape backwards it has a statantic message\u201d thing \u2014 and has been used as a way to explain ghostly visions. So why are you seeing Michael Jackson in the backseat of Paris\u2019 car? Because you really, really want to. Honestly, it took me a few hard looks to finally kind of see what other people are seeing. And that doesn't look anything like MJ. More like, Pete Burns under a pile of sheets. That's not MJ....that's Philae! =] HOOOORAY!!!  PETE BURNS IS ALIVE!!!!!! Who is Pete Burns? You spin me right round So is that last image meant to be the exact face that people are seeing? Because although I can see the face there, loading the original image into an image editor and playing around with different levels reproduces nothing even remotely similar in shape. Yeah I don't get it either. If you look at the first image, the 'person' is facing straight on or maybe off to the right a bit. The last image is black overlay-ed and almost a profile image to the left.... it completely misses the mark of what people are 'seeing'. That's what i thought, i can see the face but like you said it doesn't match up to what the video shows. Can't see shit. Hoax for the most part I reckon, just to get hype up on the Jackson family.

p166
VLasers are behind so much of our cutting-edge technology. Now scientists at the University of Michigan have successfully shown it is possible to build a working laser with blood, the better to spot tumours in the human body.\u000a A laser is technically defined as any device that creates and amplifies a narrow, focused beam of light whose photos are all travelling in the same direction, rather than in every direction at once, like the light emitted by, say, a flashlight. There are many different types of lasers, from the semiconductor lasers found in laser pointers and DVD players, to CO2 lasers capable of melting through objects. (These were no doubt the type coveted by Dr. Evil when he demanded \u201csharks with frickin\u2019 laser beams\u201d on their heads in the first Austin Powers movie.) Image: Austin Powers n Goldmember (2002) All you need to build a laser is an empty cavity holding two mirrors on either end \u2014 one of which should be half-silvered, so that it reflects some light but lets other light through \u2014 and a lasing medium. The latter medium can be a crystal, like ruby or garnet, or some kind of gas or liquid. Really, almost anything that can be made to emit light will do. Pioneering laser scientists Theodor Hänsch and Arthur Schawlow even created the first edible laser out of Jell-O around 1970, trying out 12 different flavours before finding just the right one. Zap the medium with light or electricity boosts the atoms to higher energy levels \u2014 an \u201cexcited\u201d state. Then photons are pumped into the cavity. If one strikes an excited atom, that atom will drop back down to its ground state, releasing a second photon of the same frequency and direction. These in turn strike other energised atoms, releasing even more photons. The end result is a sudden burst of coherent light \u2014 the laser beam \u2014 as all the atoms discharge in a rapid chain reaction. It\u2019s called stimulated emission, and yes, we\u2019ve heard all the dirty jokes before. In recent years, scientists have figured out how to turn individual cells into functioning lasers, injecting fatty cells in pig skin with fluorescent dye and zapping them with lasers to get them to emit light. In 2011, Harvard scientists built a laser out of a human kidney cell injected with DNA coding for a green fluorescent protein typically found in jellyfish. And the same team of Michigan scientists figured out how to turn the light-sensitive chlorophyll in plants into laser beams earlier this year. Now Xudong Fan and his Ann Arbor colleagues are back with a new study using a fluorescent dye commonly injected into the bloodstream for medical imaging: indocyanine green (ICG). It\u2019s the combination of the dye binding with proteins in blood plasma that results in the blood emitting light \u2014 essentially amplifying the emission and turning your blood into a lasing medium. Because the dye accumulates in blood vessels, and tumours usually have lots of them, the technique should make it easier to spot tumours in the body. Just inject a bit of ICG and shine a laser onto the skin, using an infrared camera to capture any resulting glow. Fan and his colleagues still need to test the concept in animal tissue. But so far, the blood laser seems promising. [New Scientist]

Many people turn to Ebay to sell their wares online. If you want to find out how much your phone is likely to sell for on the online auction website, Ebay has a handy tool that can help you. We also have some expert advice on how to increase the chances of you making a sale.  According to Ebay\u2019s own data, there is a strong demand for second-hand iPhones in Australia. There have been 9.6 million searches for iPhone on Ebay in the past 12 months. An iPhone 6 Plus could fetch up to $1206 on Ebay. There\u2019s a big demand for phones from other major brands as well. There were 4.2 million searches for Samsung smartphones in the last 12 months. Prices for handsets can vary depending on the condition, colour, model, specs and the location of the device. It can be hard to know how much to lists your phone for when you\u2019re trying to sell it online. The good news is Ebay has a tool that can help you with estimating just how much you\u2019ll get for your current handset, aptly called \u2018How Much Is Your Smartphone Worth On Ebay?\u2018 You just have to select the brand, model, storage capacity, colour and condition of your phone and the tool will determine how much your handset will sell for based on past transactions on Ebay. We asked Ebay for some advice on what makes a mobile handset listing stand out. After all, you\u2019ll be competing against a wave of other sellers who are probably also looking to make a quick sale so they can buy the new iPhone. These are the top tips Ebay provided to Lifehacker Australia: One important thing to do before you sell your device is to do delete all the content in it. That way you\u2019ll reduce the risk of your personal data falling into the wrong hands. Are you looking to sell your existing device to buy the iPhone 7? Let us know in the comments.

VThe new 2016 Jaguar XF S. Surprisingly sleek and sporty but somehow lacking the panache of Jags from yesteryear When I was a child I loved Jaguars. There was something quite beautiful about the curved lines and the super long bonnet of models like the Mark II (driven by Inspector Morse) and of course the E-Type. In the early 1970s, a businessman friend of my Dad\u2019s once took me out in his sleek silver E-Type around the Black Country where everyone it seemed drove a Ford Escort. I was hooked. It seemed so, so glamorous in comparison with other cars from the era. Later in the 1980s it was the white Jaguar XJS, driven by The Saint, Simon Templar, with the personalised registration plate ST1. What could be any more glamorous (apart from James Bond in his Aston Martin DB7 I guess). But after that it seemed that Jaguar and I parted company, my head turned by up and coming German models which may not have been so beautiful but lured me in with the promise of both power and ruthless efficiency. Of course a lot has changed in the last 30 years as I found out when attending the launch of a new range of Jaguars at the the Olde Bell Inn in Hurley, near Maidenhead. Design-wise there are still echoes of older models, particularly with the shape of the front grille, but apart from that the current models seem virtually unrecognisable from their forbears. Nevertheless there is definitely still some cachet around the brand, particularly in the US where \u2018Jag-wahs\u2019 as they pronounce are luxury items up there with Rolex watches and Range Rovers (also part of the same stable as Jaguar). Nor is it just the outside of the cars that\u2019s changed. In the past, the biggest interior design consideration seemed to be where to put the ashtray. These days high-end vehicles are stuffed to the gills with technology more akin to an aircraft cockpit (perhaps fittingly the original designer of the E-Type Malcolm Sayer began his career as an aircraft designer). And the all new Jaguar XF S, which I got to drive around The Cotswolds for a few hours, is certainly no exception. As with all executive cars these days having a large screen in the middle of the dashboard seems compulsory. In the new XF it\u2019s a bright 8 inch touch screen called the InControl Touch Pro. Unlike other high end cars we\u2019ve looked at recently (including the new Audi A4) all of the functionality has been built into the display, rather than relying on buttons either side of the screen.  I think this makes it much easier to use especially for passengers. There are also additional non-touch screens in the back to entertain the kids plus a high end Meridian Sound System, complete with 17 speakers and offering 825 Watts of power (sound is extremely good as well as powerful!) Like a smartphone, the home screen of the touch screen display can be customised with your own wallpaper and widgets set to provide shortcuts to your favourite features, much like apps on your phone\u2019s screen. Included as standard is in-car navigation, plus touch screen options for other functions such as the music you are playing and the smartphone you\u2019ve paired with the car (Bluetooth is of course included as standard). The interior of the Jaguar XF S is exceedingly luxurious, complete with 8inch touchscreen display in the centre In addition to the touch screen panel there\u2019s also the option of a £1200 laser head-up display so you can view your speed, gear shift indication and navigation instructions which are projected directly in front of your eyes. This means you don\u2019t have to look down and take your eyes off the road to take in all the important information needed when driving. Massage chair As with most cars these days, there\u2019s no shortage of inputs including an Aux input and single USB socket for hooking up a smart phone. There is also a whole host of safety features (lane departure warning, pedestrian contact sensing and autonomous emergency braking) designed to help prevent accidents. Ironically I tend to switch most of these off when I get in a car because I find them extremely distracting and more likely to cause accidents. More useful, though quite expensive, is the £1600 advanced parking assist. Using an array of cameras around the vehicle in conjunction with the large centre panel display you can see the space you are reversing into complete with red lines indicating the width of the vehicle you are reversing . You can see our gallery of the Jaguar XF S below. Open the thumbnail to view full size  However for me the most exciting feature is the built in massage facility which really does give your back a good pummeling \u2013 certainly beats those old fashioned beads you used to get for the back of your seat. Another great optional extra is Cabin Pre-heat which comes with a timer and remote and will heat your car and de-ice the windscreens for you at the desired time using a little fuel fired heater (the engine doesn\u2019t need to be on so there isn\u2019t any security risk). It\u2019s a lovely optional extra feature, but will set you back nearly £1000 so is really probably only worth investing in if you live somewhere very cold and remote and have to make a lot of early starts in the winter. The Jaguar XF S from the rear. Nice lines but I\u2019d be hard pushed to tell it\u2019s a Jag without the telltale Jag badge Smooth drive For my test drive I took out a sporty 3 litre Jaguar XF 3.0 V6 in Italian Racing Red (a very similar white model is pictured above). In terms of looks, it\u2019s everything you expect an executive car to be like. There are maybe some echoes of the past in the grille design, but if I\u2019m being honest it\u2019s virtually unrecognisable from the classic Jaguars of the 1960s and 1970s. There\u2019s also little to distinguish this model from other executive cars. If it wasn\u2019t for the Jaguar marque you might well think it\u2019s an Audi, but that\u2019s maybe no bad thing these days. Price wise the XF starts at a fairly reasonable £32,300. However the Jaguar XF S that I drove had a base price of £49,945 and with all the optional extras on board (including head up display, cabin pre-heat, adaptive LED headlamps) it\u2019s a hefty £60,805.00. Certainly not cheap. Inside the Jag the leather interior feels very luxurious and exceedingly comfortable. Nor is it just the driver who is comfortable. Jaguar claims the row-two occupants have gained 15mm more legroom, 24mm more kneeroom and 27mm more headroom too. But what was it like to drive I hear you ask? Well not bad. Driving around the edge of the Cotswolds along winding country roads in wet and muddy conditions and on the M40 Motorway, the Jaguar handled very well. An eight speed automatic, it certainly doesn\u2019t lack in power either, reaching 0-60 in a little over 5 seconds and with a top speed of 155 miles per hour \u2013 not as if I got anywhere near that speed of course. But somehow it didn\u2019t excite me. There\u2019s certainly nothing wrong with the XF \u2013 as executive cars go it does its job very well. It\u2019s just that I felt myself longing to drive something a little more challenging like an old E-Type. Sadly I think those days are long gone.

VWhen the most recent film in the Divergent series, Allegiant, didn\u2019t perform up to expectations, Lionsgate had a surprising reaction. The company said it would like to finish out the series on television. If it does that, it may have to do it without the franchise\u2019s star.\u000a Shailene Woodley, who plays the main character in the series, Tris, was recently asked by Screen Rant what she thought of the situation and it wasn\u2019t very positive. \u000aLast I heard they were trying to make it into a television show. I didn\u2019t sign up to be in a television show. Out of respect to the studio and everyone in involved, they may have changed their mind and may be doing something different, but I\u2019m not necessarily interested in doing a television show.\u000a That\u2019s not her saying she won\u2019t do it, just that she\u2019s \u201cnot necessarily interested.\u201d The timing of this quote is actually pretty funny because it came on the same day legendary actress Meryl Streep agreed to be on a television show. TV or film actress isn\u2019t really a distinction anymore, so I\u2019m curious why Woodley \u2014 who herself became a star on the TV show The Secret Life of the American Teenager \u2014 feels this way. Maybe it\u2019s because Lionsgate took the final book of the series and split it into two films, thinking Divergent could command that kind of fervor Twilight or Harry Potter did. Obviously, that didn\u2019t happen. Maybe it\u2019s just time to cut and run. Still, you have to think the company wouldn\u2019t have split the book without making sure the actress was contractually obligated to do it. This should be a fun story to follow. [Screen Rant]

VNASA\u2019s asteroid-skimming spacecraft just blasted off into space without a hitch, completing the first step in a seven-year journey that will eventually bring us back several spoonfuls worth of dirt from an asteroid.  With lift-off taking place in Cape Canaveral, not too far from the site of SpaceX\u2019s exploded rocket, there was some concern that residual damage from the destroyed rocket could delay OSIRIS-REx\u2019s trip up today. But after a review, NASA pronounced the capsule ready and capable of launching on schedule. The Atlas V rocket carrying the craft blasted off seamlessly at the very end of its two-hour launch window, which you can watch right here.  LIFTOFF! @OSIRISREx spacecraft begins its journey to asteroid Bennu and back! Keep watching: https://t.co/KX5g7zfYQe pic.twitter.com/IK8jc5mMc7 \u2014 NASA (@NASA) September 8, 2016 \u000a With a successful lift-off behind it, the journey is still far from over. We\u2019ve got seven more years to wait before the return capsule brings back a few scoops of asteroid dirt \u2014 and, perhaps, some answers to our questions about how life started here on Earth. Until then, there will be quite a bit to tide us over, including the results of a 2-year long mapping mission, which NASA scientists say will give us such a high-resolution map that we would be able to spot a penny on the asteroid. We\u2019ll update you on its progress as the craft continues outward on its journey. Yeh! Super glad this baby got up. Now all we have to do is hope it grabs some good sample. Oh, and actually makes it back. ;)

p178
VIf you use Google Docs, you probably work on a lot of documents with other people. However, there are some smaller and lesser-known options you might not know about that can take your productivity to the next level. Here are four easy tricks you can use to be more productive in Google Docs.\u000a Docs includes a web clipboard, which sends anything you cut or copy to a clipboard stored in the cloud rather than one on your local machine. As a result, you can store multiple items and take the same clipboard with you when you switch between computers. There\u2019s also the option to paste text as plain text or HTML as needed. To use it, highlight a block of text or an image, then rather than hitting Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C) go to Edit, Web clipboard and pick Copy selection to web clipboard. When you\u2019re ready to paste something, select Edit and Web clipboard again and a list of items recently copied to the cloud clipboard appears. How fast is your typing? As fast as speaking something? Docs has a rather impressive voice dictation facility included which you can activate by choosing Tools and then Voice typing from the menu. Alternatively you can activate it with a keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+S (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+S (macOS machines). It may seem a little odd talking to your computer but you\u2019ll soon get used to it and might find your word count going up as a result. There are a host of special voice commands you need to know about, but Google has listed them all \u2014 you can select and format text, move around the document, and even add in tables. Google Docs is a simple enough web program and doesn\u2019t need much in the way of configuration, so you might not have noticed the automatic text shortcut feature hidden away behind the Preferences option under Tools. Some example shortcuts are already included, like turning \u201c(c)\u201d into the copyright symbol. These shortcuts can save you a lot of typing if, for example, you replace \u201c1/4\u201d with a proper fraction symbol, complete with superscript and subscript formatting. There are no restrictions on how you can use these substitutions or how many you can have, so feel free to adapt the feature to suit your own needs. No matter how carefully you try to avoid them, typos can slip into your work every now and again, but Google Docs makes it easier to jump between them with a couple of keyboard shortcuts: use Ctrl+\u2019 or Ctrl+; (switch Ctrl for Cmd on a Mac) to jump to the next or the previous misspelled word in your document. It takes the cursor to the words underlined in red, so unfortunately it might not catch everything if you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s spelled correctly but in the wrong order. Keyboard shortcuts in general can be great productivity aids of course \u2014 there\u2019s a full list of them up on the Google Docs help pages. I like those, thanks!

VEvery dog has his day \u2014 even the clumsy ones. Samsung is currently replacing and refunding all Galaxy Note7 smartphones in Australia due to a dangerous battery fault. Now this is the bit that concerns the aforementioned clumsy types \u2014 you are entitled to a remedy from Samsung even if you broke your phone in some other way. Smashed display? No problem. Busted USB port? S\u2019all good. In short, you can score a replacement or refund regardless of the state your phone is in. Hurrah! Usually, any phone injury that is deemed to be the fault of the user is not covered under consumer warranty. There are exceptions, but by and large, if you drop your phone and crack the screen, it\u2019s considered tough luck.  But there\u2019s some good news for butter-fingered Galaxy Note7 owners \u2014 the global safety recall is providing a rare opportunity to have your phone replaced or refunded; no questions asked. If you recently busted your Samsung Galaxy Note7 through you\u2019re own stupidity, don\u2019t toss it away.  Instead, head to Samsung\u2019s Note7 recall page and fill out the online form. You can also nominate whether you want a replacement or a refund and you don\u2019t have to provide any specifics about the condition of your device. Like we said, it\u2019s your lucky day. Samsung has also confirmed that customers who received a free 256G SD card as a part of the pre-sales order get to keep the accessory. We imagine an unscrupulous person might remove the SD card from the device and then claim they didn\u2019t to score a \u201creplacement\u201d. This is called fraud and you shouldn\u2019t do it.  News today suggests one exploded and caught fire in a Perth hotel overnight.

VVideo: Hey. Wanna see something so embarrassing for everyone involved that will make you break out in hives?\u000a\u000aImage: Star Trek: Voyager, \u201cDeadlock\u201d via Trek Core In 1996, Star Trek turned 30 and had the requisite birthday party where the subject tries desperately to recapture the fun of his or her 20s. Unfortunately, Paramount and CBS decided to do that with the special Star Trek: 30 Years and Beyond. And so, the cast of Frasier (minus Frasier) joined Voyager (minus the crew, save a game Kate Mulgrew) for a sketch with the literal premise of \u201cFrasier, but in space!\u201d If you look into Mulgrew\u2019s eyes at the end, you can see her crying for help.  That was so terrible that it was amazing. As a spoof sketch obviously part of a larger "tribute" show I don't think it's that bad for what it is and certainly on par with most sketch comedy I see of a similar vein coming from American mainstream TV. They're obviously all taking the piss out of themselves.

p184
VMost of us don\u2019t have a healthy relationship with money. We think of it as enemy \u2014 something that constantly gets in our way, or we think of it as a goal, something that will solve all of our problems. In reality, money is just a tool. Realising this changed my habits in some interesting ways.\u000a Illustration by Sam Woolley. It\u2019s easy to say \u201cmoney is just a tool\u201d when you have a lot of it, though. When you don\u2019t, it feels impossible to look at money this way because so many of our problems are money problems, and those problems are big: you can\u2019t afford rent, you can\u2019t afford to leave your terrible job, you can\u2019t afford to travel outside of your neighbourhood. It\u2019s impossible to see money as a tool because money is an enemy. Or, like me, you see money as a goal, a solution, and you allow it to run your life. Money is not the enemy or the goal, though. It\u2019s just a thing you use on your priorities. Sometimes your priority is just keeping your head above water and paying rent. You depend on money in this case, but it\u2019s still a tool. The truth is, though, those problems don\u2019t magically go away just because you say, \u201cok, money\u2019s a tool.\u201d You still have the same problems, you still have to pay rent, but this perspective is crucial for one big reason: it helps you feel in control. It chips away at fear and makes room for you to shift into the driver\u2019s seat. Even if the process is gradual, that shift is what changes your situation. Here are some examples of how that works. It\u2019s hard to make money plans when you\u2019re afraid of money. You don\u2019t bother budgeting your spending because looking at your bank account gives you anxiety. You don\u2019t bother crunching the numbers because they never add up, and even if they do, it\u2019s impossible to stick to. You chalk it all up to being impossible. When you think of money as a tool, you can focus on solutions over emotions, because there are clear ways to best use that tool. This post from author Carl Richards changed my perspective, and in it, he explains: \u000aThis shift in thinking is definitely subtle, but it changes our feelings about saving and spending. We no longer need to think in terms of good and bad, positive or negative. We\u2019re focused on the outcome of our actions.\u000a Richards really says it well here \u2014 it\u2019s just a mindset shift, but it\u2019s a mindset shift that\u2019s focused on action, and when it comes to personal finance, that\u2019s everything. It starts with a meaningful goal. Money itself is not the goal. You have to know how you plan to use that money. Is it to feed your family? Pay down debt, or outstanding medical bills? Travel? Either way, when you know the end goal, you can work on your strategy for using money to reach that goal. Your plan might be: When you think of money as a resource or a tool, that implies it\u2019s to be used, so in a way, you give yourself permission to use it. Yes, it takes a lot of work, and it\u2019s not exactly easy to use, but it\u2019s a lot easier to come up with a plan when you think of money in these terms instead of as a roadblock, even if it feels that way. We all know that it often pays to splurge on quality. For example, a University of Michigan study tracked toilet paper purchases of more than 100,000 American households for seven years. The study found that high income households bought toilet paper on sale 39% of the time, compared to 28% for low income households. High income households also bought more rolls on average compared to low income households. Overall, low income households paid about 6% extra per sheet. Here\u2019s what the study concluded: \u000athe inability to buy in bulk inhibits the ability to time purchases to take advantage of sales, and the inability to accelerate purchase timing to buy on sale inhibits the ability to buy in bulk. We find that the financial losses low income households incur due to underutilisation of these strategies can be as large as half of the savings they accrue by purchasing cheaper brands.\u000a To be fair, when you\u2019re living hand to mouth, you can\u2019t always afford to buy quality. Even when you can afford it, though, some of us still have a hard time paying the extra cash. For a long time, I had a problem with this. I\u2019ve always been afraid of spending money because I\u2019m afraid of not having it. I feel guilty for spending more than I have to spend, even if it\u2019s on something as simple as toilet paper. Again, Richards says it really well: \u000aTools are meant to be used. They\u2019re not meant to sit on a shelf and collect dust. Instead of thinking in terms of saving and spending money, I started to think of using it\u2026.Money is meant to be used, to be in motion. It circulates from us to other people then back to us again. Even when we save money, we\u2019re simply storing it for use later. When we use money today, we\u2019re not spending it or blowing it. We\u2019re using the best tool available to get the job done\u2026\u000a I realised I had a bad habit of idealising money, which made me feel guilty for spending it. I realised I could be frugal and still spend lavishly because frugality isn\u2019t about saving money: it\u2019s about using money, as a tool, efficiently. Sometimes buying quality is just an efficient way of using that tool. Since learning to look at money as a tool, I\u2019ve also noticed that it\u2019s much easier to resist impulsive spending. We\u2019ve talked about prioritising your spending before, but sometimes it\u2019s still hard to resist, even though you know that phone upgrade isn\u2019t a priority. I\u2019m aware that there\u2019s a wrong way to use this tool and I\u2019m aware it can screw up the way I use it in other areas: it\u2019s a limited resource. This practical awareness makes it a lot easier to resist. To increase the amount of cash in your bank account, you can save more of what you already make, or you can earn more cash. For a long time, I thought of the two as mutually exclusive \u2014 do I save more or do I earn more? When money is the goal, it\u2019s natural to think in these terms. When my mindset shifted, though, I realised saving more and earning more were just methods I could use to reach my larger, more meaningful goals: to support a family, to travel more, and to have more time to work on my own creative projects. I could save more and earn more to facilitate my goals. I could also pinpoint when saving more and earning more became counterproductive. Sometimes, these methods actually hurt rather than helped my goals. For example, some money saving habits were a complete waste of my time. My goal was to have more free time to work on my own projects, so this became counterproductive. Sometimes I\u2019d take on work I didn\u2019t enjoy just for the extra cash. That was counterproductive, too, because I had less time to spend on my projects. In short, viewing money as a tool helped me prioritise my goals and weed out the inefficient ways of using that tool to accomplish those goals. Personal finance has everything and nothing to do with money. It\u2019s about learning how to use money in the best way possible to live the life you want. Of course, \u201cthink of money as a tool\u201d is a lot easier said than done. Even now, after being fully inspired by Richards\u2019 post, I struggle not to idealize money. A few things have helped keep my brain in check, though. Breaking up your goals into smaller milestones can make them a little less overwhelming. When you\u2019re focused on action, you\u2019re more likely to take action and feel in control. It makes it a lot easier to see money as a practical tool rather than some scary milestone. For most of us, money is symbolic of something much larger than it actually is. It reminds us that we don\u2019t have enough. It reminds of the things we can\u2019t afford to do. At its core, though, money really is just a tool. It can be a powerful one, especially when you don\u2019t have enough of it. A simple shift in mindset isn\u2019t going to change your financial situation overnight, but it\u2019s a necessary step in getting your finances under control. Money is an enabler. A telephone is an enabler. A computer is an enabler. They allow us to do\u000aThings we otherwise couldn't do. When I was a poor student with almost no money, I could easily budget and buy in bulk. What I needed to do was separate essential from desirable and to think ahead. These are skills my brother still has not mastered, which is why he doesn't have a cent to his name, despite earning excellent money. I shared accommodation to save money. I lived on packet noodles and fruit to save money. I postponed buying a car. I skipped the overseas trips. I lived like a pauper until I was 30.  Why?  Because the sooner I saved for retirement, the better. I bought indexed assets along the way. I researched my assets while I was saving for them so that I knew what to buy and how much to pay.  I calculated likely living costs per year and used that to determine the income that my assets needed to generate. Again, the trick is to separate what I like vs what I need. Also, to think ahead. I'm yet to come across a single person who couldn't buy toilet paper in bulk. The only people I know/knew who made that statement bought several packs of cigarettes a week (and/or loads of alcohol) and then told others they couldn't afford food. Maybe, the US is different. I've never met a person (or family) who were so desperate that buying a few groceries in bulk was not an option. I know unemployed single parents, struggling low income parents, etc and they can ALL afford cigarettes and/or alcohol and/or bulk groceries. My brother once said that when he was being a loser, he always knew it. He also said that he always knew right from wrong. I think these were some of the wisest words he ever said to me. If I had to guess, I would put mental health issues as a bigger problem for saving than availability of money. Depression, stress, anxiety. These things stop people being able to make rational decisions.  They can also demotivate people's want for a better life. They also lead people to seeking an escape (cigarettes, alcohol, drugs). A budget is a tool. A plan is a tool. Sometimes, we need help to enable our use of those tools.

Three card slots are provided \u2013 one nano-SIM, one micro-SIM and one microSD slot \u2013 for full flexibility and keeping roaming costs down by using a local SIM. \u201cThe Honor 5X is a no-nonsense smartphone that delivers all the essentials digital natives want and need in a device,\u201d said George Zhao, president of Honor. \u201cWe designed the Honor 5X to be an extension of the personalities of its users \u2013 cool, stylish and iconic \u2013 and integrated innovative technology to give a superior connected experience, all at an affordable price.\u201d \u201cSince its founding two years ago, the Honor brand has seen extraordinary growth by focusing on the online market and bringing digital natives devices that suit their digital lifestyles,\u201d said Zhao. \u201cThat success led to expansion beyond China and we are thrilled that the Honor 5X will be available in Europe, the Americas and Asia/Pacific.\u201d Also due to launch in March is the premium version of the Honor 7 with more in-built memory. Other specifications remain unchanged with fast octa-core processor, fingerprint-sensor to protect your data, 20 MP camera and fast charger. Finally Honor presents the Honor hybrid earphones AM175. Provided are inline controls to play music, to change volume or to answer incoming phone calls. The headphones are compatible with a range of Android phones and designed to complement Honor smartphones, including the Honor 5X. The AM175 will be released starting from March 2016 in a range of different colours, including black and white.

VeasyJet has been working with students to develop a hybrid plane that uses a hydrogen fuel cell stowed in the aircraft\u2019s hold Budget airline easyJet is probably best known for its gaudy orange livery and cheap flights to holiday destinations than for being a technology pioneer. But all that could be about to change. The no frills airline has taken inspiration from students at Cranfield University \u2013 a global leader in education and research in technology and management \u2013 who were asked to develop ideas for what air travel might look like in twenty years\u2019 time, as part of a competition to celebrate easyJet\u2019s 20th birthday. easyJet will now work with its industry partners and suppliers to apply the cutting edge technology much sooner (but don\u2019t expect it to be in place on your next holiday!) The hybrid plane concept utilises a hydrogen fuel cell stowed in the aircraft\u2019s hold. This innovative zero-emissions system allows energy to be captured as the aircraft brakes on landing and is used to charge the system\u2019s lightweight batteries. This is much like the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) found in Formula 1 cars.

VSell by, best if used by, expires on, display until; the shelf life of food seems like it\u2019s a well regulated, concrete affair, but it\u2019s not: It differs by region and type of food. In the end, those labels mean almost nothing, which leads to both food waste and an assumption of safety.\u000a\u000aIllustration by Sam Woolley. The origin of expiration dates is a classic life hack. By the 1970s, Americans had moved away from buying food from farms and small grocers and purchasing the bulk of their edibles from grocery stores. At the time, manufacturers started using special codes like the one above that told supermarkets when to rotate stock. As you\u2019d expect, someone deciphered these codes and released a small book, called Blind Dates: How to Break the Codes on the Foods You Buy. As the name suggests, the book walked consumers through how the codes worked so they could buy the freshest food. For a taste of how it all worked back then, this article published in 1978 from the Deseret News walks you through what the process was like. As more and more consumers cracked the codes, more people started asking for some type of freshness label on their food. As they did, supermarkets and food suppliers voluntarily started including sell by dates on their food. As time went on, sell by dates became common, but consistency didn\u2019t. In Australia, manufacturers were legally required to date mark their food from 1978, following the US\u2019 introduction of the practice in the mid-\u201970s, and since then the requirements for labelling have evolved and been amended. As of 1 March 2016, food labelling in Australia is regulated by the revised Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. We have different terminology that all means different things. In most cases, those labels describe food quality and have nothing to do with food safety. As an example, let\u2019s break down some of the most common terms a defined by the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code Standard 1.2.5: For most packaged foods, these dates are usually left up to the food producer\u2019s discretion. They usually work with third-party companies who perform tests to see how long it takes food to spoil and how shelf-stable packaged food really is. For example, they will leave food out on a shelf for weeks and create a rating system to describe its quality over time. Or sometimes, it\u2019s just a taste test. Other times, it\u2019s more about how the food looks, and has nothing to do with taste or nutritional value. In any case, it\u2019s not particularly scientific or indicative of the actual safety of food, and it\u2019s all highly subjective. NPR dug into exactly how this process works: \u000aThe experts give the food grades, in numbers. The numbers go down as the food gets older. Bread gets stale. Salad dressings can start to taste rancid.\u000a\u000aJohn Ruff, president of the Institute of Food Technologists in Chicago, says the companies that sell this food take a look at those grades and decide where they will draw the line, to protect the reputation of their products.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf the product was designed, let\u2019s say, to be a 7 when it was fresh, you may choose that at 6.2, it\u2019s gotten to the point where [you] don\u2019t want it to be on the market anymore,\u201d he says.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf it\u2019s 6.0, would most people still find it reasonably good? Absolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cBut companies want people to taste their products as best they can at the optimum, because that\u2019s how they maintain their business and their market shares.\u201d\u000a The process in Australia is not all that different \u2013 companies conduct their own testing to determine whether their own food is suitable for consumption. Which all goes to say that most expiration dates, regardless of the terminology used, are mostly about the \u201cquality\u201d of food, as determined by the manufacturer. They rarely have anything to do with the safety of that food or eventual spoilage. We like to think there\u2019s a quantifiable date that will tell us when food will go bad, but there are too many variables for something so simple. That\u2019s the real problem with food expiration dates. How long food sits on a truck waiting to be unloaded at a grocery store, how long it\u2019s in your car on the drive home, how long it\u2019s on your counter before you put it away and more all factor into the timeline for food spoilage. It can even come down to your refrigerator\u2019s temperature (which should be at 4C or below), or even where you store the food in your fridge. More importantly though, \u201cexpired food\u201d isn\u2019t guaranteed to make you sick. It just means that food doesn\u2019t taste as good. What usually makes you sick are foodborne pathogens like Salmonella or E. coli, which can live in your food before you buy it, or even persist after you cook it if you don\u2019t cook it properly. There\u2019s no label or timeline that guarantees your food is free from bacteria that may make you sick. Bacterial growth is time and temperature dependent, so proper food handling is more important than a printed date. This is also why food tends to last longer in the freezer than it does in your fridge \u2014 the freezer may not kill all bacteria, but it does slow them down a bit, and halts bacterial growth. Either way, spoiled food might taste gross (and there\u2019s no reason to eat it if you don\u2019t have to,) but that alone doesn\u2019t make it unsafe to eat. So, if the dates are mostly arbitrary, what can you do? Well, the sniff test is still your best option. If it smells bad, it will taste bad. Your eyes can also tell you a lot. If food looks spoiled, it probably is. Likewise, certain meats, like chicken, tend to get a slimy texture and dull colour when they spoil. We all have the innate ability to tell when food is appetising or pungent and rotten. Trust your senses. Beyond that, there are some other basic guidelines that can help. The USDA\u2019s chart above is a helpful starting guide. If you want to want to dig into the longevity of specific packaged and opened foods, sites like StillTasty and Eat By Date feature a ton of tips about how long food tends to last in the fridge or frozen. More importantly, both sites give you tips on identifying when food spoils, so it\u2019s useful when you\u2019re doing the sniff test and you\u2019re not sure if what you smell is as bad as it seems. Finally, your best bet is to store your food properly so that it actually lasts as long as it\u2019s supposed to. When food\u2019s mishandled, say, by defrosting frozen chicken wings at room temperature for six hours, that alters the safety more than anything else, so make sure you follow the basic rules for defrosting. Keep a sharp eye for mould or other signs of spoilage, and cook your food thoroughly and properly to avoid contamination. The fact is, the expiration dates, regardless of the language they use, mean little. While they\u2019re worth a glance when you\u2019re standing in the grocery store, they\u2019re worthless beyond that point, and certainly not worth the faith most of us put in them. We can do much better with our eyes and noses. Or if you buy your food from Coles run by bad branch managers, every town has one. Then expiration dates don't mean anything outright. Mould on fruit and vedge 1 hour after it's come out of the freezer. Milk that's off even though it has a use by 2 weeks later date. Eggs that are cracked open in every box you check, and bread that's stale after just a few hours even though it says it's been baked on the day. Food can taste and smell fine but still give you food poisoning so don't rely on the sniff test. Keep leftovers and sliced deli meats for up to 3 days in the fridge then either use or freeze. Read instructions on the label e.g. refrigerate after opening and use within 7 days. Aways use food by its use by date, best before dates can be used after that date but may have lost some quality see more advice at http://www.foodsafety.asn.au To say that you can rely on the 'sniff test' is dangerously inaccurate. Food that looks OK, smells OK and has 'normal' texture can still be off, and the risk of the food being off after a use by date is much, much higher.\u000aFood poisoning is mainly caused by bacteria which can cause food to spoil. Most Food poisoning bacteria do not change the smell, taste or appearance of the food. These bacteria include Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, certain strains of E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. All of which can make you sick at best and at worst be life threatening.\u000aMore information on food poisoning can be found here: http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/safety/foodpoison/Pages/default.aspx\u000aMore information on used by and best before dates can be found here: http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/labelling/dates/Pages/default.aspx \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 4:38 pm

V Most of us have learned the hard way that there\u2019s a certain technique to pouring our beer without making it overflow and ruin everything. You have to strategically tilt the glass as you pour to prevent a massive buildup of foam. Why? Because beer chemistry.\u000a The foam is due to all of the carbon dioxide in the beer bottle or can. As SciShow explains, when you crack open a beer, that satisfying kychuk sound indicates some carbon dioxide has escaped, but most of it is still inside the can. As you waterfall the beer, tilting the glass helps you avoid trapped air pockets called nucleation sites that would help the rest of the carbon dioxide escape. When the escaped gas combines with proteins from the beer\u2019s grains, you get the bubbly foam, otherwise known as head. Everyone\u2019s got their own beer to head ratio. Check the rest of the video for the best technique to pour your perfect beer (which also works for champagne). What\u2019s the Best Way to Pour Beer? [SciShow] as any bar staff will tell you it's not just about the tilt.\u000aTemperature and gas can also affect the beer. As can a new keg.\u000aAnd its even more complex with dark ales or stouts like Guinness, you can use the back of a spoon or buy a special thing that looks like an upside-down collander.

VFoxtel\u2019s subscription TV service, Foxtel Play, is getting a pricing makeover \u201cdesigned to make it competitive\u201d with rivals Netflix and Stan. Foxtel also signed a new long-term agreement with HBO starting January 2017, increasing the broadcasting of HBO content by five times, and allowing you to access the entire HBO library on-demand, forever. Hmmm. A \u201cbring your own device\u201d and \u201cbring your own bandwidth\u201d approach to Foxtel Play will be launched in December, with five different entry level tiers between $9 and $15 a month. There will be two options for drama plus one option for Lifestyle, one for Documentary and one for Kids. There\u2019s also a Sports tier and a Movies tier. You will have access to all channels in the tier you choose, along with all of the on-demand, catch up and library content available to that tier \u2014 plus mobile access via Foxtel Go. With the new pricing, Foxtel says it is now providing everything from a low cost, low commitment entry point, through to the premium, high end of the subscription TV spectrum via full service cable/satellite set top boxes. In terms of new content, on top of the HBO deal Foxtel are also creating six new Australasian productions as part of including a a $125 million investment in local content \u2014 the first to be announced is a remake of Picnic at hanging rock.  There\u2019s the Binge channel launching 1 October, and also a Stars Wars channel in the works \u2014 we can expect that one before Rogue One. But where does all this leave Presto, Foxtel\u2019s on SVOD baby with Seven West Media? Nothing has been confirmed as yet, but we do know the service hasn\u2019t exactly made headway against its major rivals. Time will tell.  This article originally appeared on Gizmodo Australia. Will it come with *endless* funeral insurance ads. I think that was the clincher some 5 or 6 years back when I stopped paying them $130 a month. I was tired of hearing whiney kids going on about their dead grandma, who could have been buried for less than a price of a cup of coffee a day. No thanks. Foxtel has done it's dash in my home. Just recently cancelled foxtel satellite but would consider looking at it again if they can get the plans right. Foxtel play also has issues that need resolving as well, primarily picture quality and resolution.

V\u000a\u000aHopefully you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about running out of juice at this year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival as EE has signed up for its third year as the official technology and communications partner with what it promises is the world\u2019s largest festival mobile phone charging operation. EE is providing two Power Bar Exchange points on site this year, able to accommodate over 200,000 Power Bar swaps during the festival weekend. The EE Power Bar \u2013 an portable phone charger \u2013 was launched at Glastonbury last year as an alternative to traditional charging. Users charge their phone on the go with the bar and then, once it runs out of juice, simply swap it for a fully charged one at the designated Exchange sites. Spencer McHugh, Director of Brand at EE, said: \u201cOur Power Bar phone charging initiative began at Glastonbury in 2014 and proved so popular that we launched it last month as a year-round loyalty scheme for all customers.  We received over a million requests in just four days, so to say there is huge demand for this simple charging solution is an understatement, and at festivals the need for a fully-charged phone is even greater. \u201cLast year, we know customers uploaded the equivalent of 1.5 million pictures during the festival and downloaded 2.5 terabytes of data, which is the same as 650,000 headlining tracks. To meet this demand we are rolling out the EE Power Bar swap scheme on an unprecedented scale.\u201d This year, anyone wishing to take advantage of the swapping system on-site must have an official 2015 EE Power Bar and will need to register for a special wristband by the 7th June.  The wristband allows each user one swap per day. EE Power Bars are available (subject to stock availability) at no charge to all EE, Orange or T-Mobile customers. Non-EE customers can pay £20 to take part in the scheme. All Glastonbury-goers will be contacted directly on May 26th to confirm the details of this process. Traditional charging in the EE Recharge tent \u2013 which is free to all \u2013 will also be available on site from EE ensuring as many festival-goers as possible can stay powered up. This year EE is promising a superfast 4G network \u2013 complete with six mobile masts \u2013 enabling guests at the festival to upload pictures and videos in record time. EE is also working alongside Glastonbury Festival to update the official Glastonbury app with a new look and exciting new features for 2015. The upgraded app will be available in June and allow those on site to stay better connected with friends than ever before.

VApple has just announced the highly-anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Here\u2019s a rundown of the specification for both of the new phones, when they\u2019ll be available and how much they will cost in Australia.  We compare all the available iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus plans from Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and Virgin right here. The iPhone 7 shares a similar design to the iPhone 6 but with a few notable changes. It has a sleeker look to it now that the antenna line on the back of the phone is gone. The home button has been updated to a Force Touch pressure-sensitive input. Apple has also changed the way its CPUs work. It now uses two high performance cores and two high efficiency cores, known as the \u2018big little\u2019 design used by ARM and Qualcomm. It means that you can rely on the two efficient cores for smaller tasks without having to wake up the high performance cores. This makes the devices more power efficient. One of the major changes is the lack of a headphone jack. Yes, the 3.5mm headphone jack is no more. Now there\u2019s only one single Lightning port on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. You\u2019ll be charging the devices and listening to audio all from the same port. Apple has included a new Lightning-based headset and an adaptor in the box to appease those who protested against getting rid of the 3.5mm jack. Here\u2019s a look at the chief specifications: The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be shipped on Friday, September 16 and customers can start ordering the devices on Friday, September 9. Pre-orders can be done through the Apple Store online. The outright cost of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus varies depending on how much storage you want. For iPhone 7: As for the iPhone 7 Plus: Australian telcos have not released their own pricing of the phone on their contracted plans yet but we\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for them. UPDATE: Here\u2019s the full list of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus plans from Vodafone.  Stay tuned for plan comparisons for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Storage	32GB (+ MicroSD card slot)	   are you sure?? Sorry! I had used the table template for a different different device. No, iPhone doesn't have an microSD slot. Fixed now! Thanks for flagging this! As an OUTRIGHT price for a 32GB iP7 that is reasonable considering I got my 16GB iP6 for $100 less outright. Shame I will keep using my iP6 until Apple no longer supports it, or if there is a Special Anniversary edition next year as it will be 10 years since the iPhone was released to the public. Pity they didn't develop it further as my 2 IT savvy sons advise that their Sony Z5 phone is still vastly superior for less than half the price. Looking at some of the following features it would appear that they are probably right.. No wonder my boys have a dislike of my Apple Crap!\u000aSony z5 screen size is bigger than the IPhone 7, has a much better camera at 23Mb versus 7's\u000a12Mb. and has 4K with resolution of 1920 X 1080 and 32 Mb of memory and all for around $500.\u000aMaybe time for all of us old Apple supporters to try a Sony smart phone.\u000aHave a look, do a comparison and then maybe forget the over prices and under developed IPhone 7. Robh, the iPhone isn't popular because people don't realize there are cheaper phones.  Many people will pay a premium for subtle things like Apples build quality, warranty & service for example.  More tangible things you may be interested to know are iPhone CPU's have been the top performers for the last 4-5 years, handily outperforming the Xperia range.  iOS is also known to be generally a more secure OS not to mention a more streamlined and user friendly interface.  There is much more going on that your boys aren't telling you ;) The iphone is popular because Apple are masters at marketing, not because they make better products. They have managed to brand themselves as a "premium" tech supplier whilst putting some of the cheapest/ageing technology into their devices to keep manufacturing costs right down. It is seriously masterful on their behalf they have managed to convince so many people of this and to have them rusted on as die hard supporters no matter what they release and of what quality. I don't know where you are pulling your claims from but here is a spec sheet side by side http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=7536&idPhone2=7243 Apple make inferior phones the specs don't lie yet they charge an absolute premium for it. They are great at making pretty looking phones and putting yesterday's technology in it and claiming it to be a breakthrough. iOS being more secure is becoming an absolute myth these days it was true 10-15 years ago when the apple ecosystem was tiny. Apple dropped the claim quietly in 2012 that "macs don't get viruses" but they had been pedaling that line for over a decade so it is still a myth that they are somehow more "secure" and simply refuses to die.  There really isn't much more going on in iOS especially these days other than being fleeced for overpriced goods.  Just to clarify I use both platforms on a daily basis windows/linux/mac/android and iphones I look at the facts rather than the spin. Give them some credit. Last time I checked, Apple invented smart phones. They made the first mass market appeal smart phone. They didn't invent smart phones another myth. As I said Apple are master marketers and the blatant lies they have marketed for many years is hard to dispel. IPhone 7 plus has 3GB of RAM

p202
VFor the better part of a decade, the most fascinating narrative about the Avatar sequels was their release dates. Now that we think that\u2019s settled, director James Cameron has finally begun to reveal what the actual narrative will be about: Family.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to Variety, Cameron revealed for the first time what the Avatar sequels will be about in terms of story: \u000aThe storyline in the sequels really follows Jake and Neytiri and their children. It\u2019s more of a family saga about the struggle with the humans.\u000a A \u201cfamily saga\u201d makes sense, considering Cameron is promising not just one, but four sequels. To see Jake and Neytiri grow old, pass the torch to their children, maybe die and get a real sense of history would fit well into a five-film saga. Not to mention, take up less of Zoe Saldana\u2019s time. The first of those sequels is still on track for Christmas 2018 but Cameron admitted that he\u2019s OK with changing it again if he must. (It was originally scheduled for release in 2014.) \u201cWe haven\u2019t moved that target yet, but we will if we need to,\u201d the director told Variety. \u201cThe important thing for me is not when the first one comes out but the cadence of the release pattern. I want them to be released as close together as possible. If it\u2019s an annual appointment to show up at Christmas, I want to make sure that we\u2019re able to fulfil on that promise.\u201d At the moment, the films are scheduled a few years apart. Avatar 2 will be released Christmas 2018. Avatar 3 will follow on Christmas 2020, Avatar 4 on Christmas 2022 and finally Avatar 5 on Christmas 2023. [Variety via /Film] Dunno if we'll get tired of them by then. I was tired of The Hobbit and Hunger Games by the final films. Yes, but to be fair, that's because The Hobbit was half a film stretched into three, and done pretty badly at that. The Hunger Games was the same film twice and then two dull films back to back. Hopefully Avatar can maintain a decent storyline. Based on the first film, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, at least til the first one is screened. That is true. LOTR kept me till the end but that was probably the first big trilogy that came out with regularity and had a great story that kept me till the end. I even have the extended trilogy on DVD! I ask myself, if my only ability in life was that I was very good at killing others ie an exceptionally remorseless and brutal soldier, what chance do I have to create and maintain healthy family relationships? BTW I have respect for our military. I'm talking about psycho Hollywood creations. Ugh, family saga. Yeah I was thinking the same thing. Common Cameron, how about we see them stumble across a crashed Sulaco, it has an egg inside and the Na'vi Aliens turn into...well...Aliens. Now thats originality! yea but so is Star Wars yeah true, the family aspect will only be core, important granted, as it was in Star Wars, its a tried old formula, and its still not giving away much. Hope he (Cameron) gives us some great story to go with it. Or how about the humans come back, drop a load of chemical/bio weapons from orbit, wipe out the Na'vi, and strip the planet/moon bare? hmmm, we could look into it i suppose. Nuke them from orbit, it's the only way to be sure.

Oh and there\u2019s a Red Dwarf game coming out too, but it looks utterly pants.  We heard about two new seasons last year, of course, but a game is kind of left-field. As the official Red Dwarf website notes, there have been other attempts at games based on show, but they\u2019re entirely forgettable. The game, developed by GameDigits and imaginatively titled \u201cRed Dwarf XI\u201d, will be available on both iOS and Android platforms. Its launch will \u201ccoincide with the new series\u201d and feature Starbug navigating a \u201cwide range of minigames\u201d. Here\u2019s a screenshot: I know, I know, you don\u2019t have to say it. \u201cSmeg points\u201d? Oh dear. I will give them one thing \u2014 the game will be updated with extra, show-related content as each episode airs, which is kind of neat. As for season 11 itself \u2014 I couldn\u2019t track down any information regarding local air dates, or even if the ABC will pick it up at all. That said, I realise this is a completely irrelevant detail for anyone with even the most basic knowledge of how the internet works.

VWe tend to think of dips as white, creamy liquids with flecks of herbs or other greenery hanging out in there, but Serious Eats has a recipe for one that is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever dipped a carrot in, and it contains pork, miso and walnuts.\u000a\u000aPhoto by Vicky Wasik. A meat-based dip may seem a little strange at first blush but, when paired with miso and and toasted walnuts, you get something truly delicious and substantial to dip your veggies in. Beyond those three ingredients, you\u2019ll also need mirin (rice wine), sugar, dashi and diced onion. The onion is cooked until translucent, at which point to pork is added and browned. Next, toasted, ground walnuts are stirred in, followed by a mixture of miso, dashi, mirin and sugar. All of this is reduced until you have a thick paste, which is then ready to be served with raw vegetables, lettuce cups or some sort of chip or flatbread. Bored With Ranch?

VIt seems after helming Midnight Special, Jeff Nichols has still got a taste for science fiction. He\u2019s just signed on to Alien Nation, a remake of the 1988 film turned TV series about a cop who teams with an alien in the city of Los Angeles.\u000a A still from 1988\u2019s Alien Nation. Image: Fox Deadline broke the news of the deal, which will see Nichols write and direct the film. The original starred James Caan as the human cop, forced to team up with an alien (Homeland\u2018s Mandy Patinkin), who is struggling to assimilate to Earth. Using that relationship the film, and subsequent TV show, explored social issues such as racism. Though Midnight Special is the biggest film Nichols has done, he\u2019s best known for his smaller stuff. He made Mud with Matthew McConaughey, Take Shelter with Michael Shannon, and has an Oscar contender this year with Loving, starring Preacher\u2018s Ruth Negga. Alien Nation is a brand that\u2019s mostly faded away from the public conscious, but the idea remains incredibly timely: A group of aliens crash lands on Earth and do their best to peacefully join human society, but face a great deal of prejudice and fear. It\u2019s no wonder Fox has been trying to resurrect it for a few years now. Happily, in Nichols they found a filmmaker perfect to delicately explore that with a modern spin.

VAn adventurous young girl sets out with a demi-god to solve the mystery of her people in Moana, the upcoming film from Disney Animation. It sounds like a simple story, but as directors Ron Clements and John Musker can tell you, putting it on-screen is anything but simple.\u000a\u000aMaui and Moana are about to go on an adventure in Moana. All Images: Disney Earlier this winter, we visited Disney and talked to Clements and Musker about the history of Moana, the incredibly complex process of making it and the challenges of bringing the culture and the folklore of the South Pacific to life \u2014 along with the dumbest Disney character ever. Moto Nui, the island created for Moana. \u201cIn order to know where you\u2019re going, you need to know where you come from.\u201d It was a sentiment the people of the South Pacific impressed upon the filmmakers and is also echoed in Disney culture itself. Research and preparation are everything. So, various teams who\u2019d be working on the film took three trips to islands like Fiji, Bora Bora, Tahiti, Samoa and others to soak up as much as possible. The first trip was a general one in October 2011. Music and culture were the focus of a March 2014 trip, and then visuals were the focus of a third trip in November 2014. The directors meet with some local experts. \u201cIn Tahiti, one of the elders said \u2018We\u2019ve been swallowed by your culture. One time, can you be swallowed by our culture?'\u201d explained Clements. \u201cWe took that very seriously.\u201d To make sure their film was bound to history and culture, the filmmakers recruited a team of local experts nicknamed \u201cThe Oceanic Story Trust\u201d. The group advised on the story, names, dialogue and cultural references, and made sure Moana was staying true to the ideals and customs of the South Pacific. \u201cThey know so much and we felt a responsibility to them,\u201d said Musker. \u201c[We kept] them involved so we can keep this right.\u201d A storyboard from Moana. Moana is set 2000 years ago. At that time in actual history, the people of the South Pacific were the greatest explorers on Earth. Using only stars and currents, they accomplished some of the greatest feats of exploration and migration in history. Then, one day, it stopped for 1000 years. No one knows why. Clements and Musker thought coming up with a story to explain why the exploration stopped would be fertile, and the idea of finding your way mirrored the journey of the young girl at the centre of their story. Young Moana meets the ocean for the first time. The hero of the story is Moana, a young girl voiced by newcomer Auli\u2019i Cravalho. We meet Moana as a young child, where her sense of adventure instantly makes her an ally and friend of the ocean, which is literally a character in the film. It plays with her, interacts with her, cradles her, becomes familiar shapes and helps her as she grows into a teenager and sets off on her journey. It\u2019s much like the water alien in The Abyss, but a bit more heart-warming. By the way, Moana actually means \u201cocean\u201d in Maori. Maui and his magic fish hook. The second lead of the film is Maui, a demigod voiced by Dwayne Johnson. Like Cravalho and all the leads of the film, Johnson has Pacific Island roots. As for Maui, he\u2019s an actual legend of a powerful god who carries a magical fish hook that helped raise the islands of the South Pacific from the ocean. Clements and Musker took a bunch of the ancient mythology about who Maui was, and created the Disney amalgamation. Te Vaka performs at the D23 Expo in 2015. Much like Little Mermaid and Aladdin before it, Ron Clements and John Musker wanted Moana to be a musical. And so it is, with music by Opetaia Foa\u2019i, the founder of the popular contemporary Pacific band Te Vaka, Mark Mancina (Speed, Bad Boys, Lion King) and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the latter being the award-winning creator and star of Hamilton. What\u2019s interesting about Miranda\u2019s inclusion, though, is he came on very early in the process, long before Hamilton became a cultural phenomenon. But by the time it did, he would Skype into Disney from backstage on Broadway, sometimes in full costume. Taika Waititi in What We Do In the Shadows. He wrote the first draft of Moana. Disney Animated films go through dozens and dozens of versions before you see them on screen. But they have to start somewhere, and for Moana, the filmmakers turned to New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi for the first draft. Waititi is best known for starring in and directing What We Do in the Shadows, and he\u2019s currently directing Thor: Ragnarok. While much of his dialogue is no longer in the film, the directors admitted some of his major beats and ideas were kept in. The filmmakers expect Hei Hei, a sidekick rooster character, to be one of the breakouts from the film. But he was almost cut out. After several story meetings, the producers and directors didn\u2019t think Hei Hei added to the story. So John Lasseter gave the writers 48 hours to figure out how to save him, or he was out. The result was taking a character that was kind of macho and dropping his IQ exponentially. They now surmise Hei Hei is literally the dumbest character in Disney history, and because of that, he\u2019s not just a friend of Moana, he\u2019s a complication. And that kept him in the movie. Another sure to be breakout character in the film is dubbed Mini Maui. It\u2019s one of Maui\u2019s tattoos, of himself, and the character serves as the real Maui\u2019s conscience. He runs around Maui\u2019s body, communicates with him non-verbally, and was created with traditional 2D animation. He was hand-drawn, then imported into the computer so he\u2019d fit into the world but have a standout look. Concept art of Maui Besides just Mini Maui, all of Maui\u2019s tattoos are an important part of the story and character. They immortalise his exploits, as each tattoo tells a part of Maui\u2019s backstory, with Mini Maui at the centre. Visually, this looks very cool but technically, the animators found it extremely difficult because they were animating on skin, which itself is also a moving, breathing surface. Sketch of Maui as a hawk. Besides the magic fish hook and moving tattoos, Maui has another power. He transforms. He becomes a hawk, a shark and a bug, making him quite a formidable ally for Moana on her quest to solve the mystery of her people. Again, though, animating a human who seamlessly morphs into an animal was a challenge for Disney Animation, as it\u2019s not something they usually do. A quick TV glimpse of Teka Looking like a blend of Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy and the Balrog from Lord of the Rings, the lava guardian Teka is one of the villains of Moana. He\u2019s an ancient being who is after the Heart of the Ocean, a crucial piece of the story which Maui stole centuries ago and Moana must find again. Each time Teka is in a shot, there are about 10 layers of animation happening simultaneously: Fire, smoke and water splashes. A ton of costume options for Moana. When you\u2019re making a Disney Animation movie, the process starts slow but then gets very, very fast. The story team said that at times later in the production, they found themselves only a few hours ahead of animation. Meaning, they were finishing dialogue and story that would then immediately go to animation. The shortest window they could recall was five hours between the departments. At one point in the film, Moana and Maui encounter the Kakamora, a creepy group of characters who are kind of like walking coconuts. They travel on massive, massive boats and chase Maui and Moana. The visual effect of the characters hanging all over them, in a chase scene, was absolutely inspired by the visuals and actions of Mad Max: Fury Road, according to Clements and Musker. One of the most impressive things about Disney Animation is how every movie they make couldn\u2019t have been made a few years before. As software and hardware advances, the production is constantly pushing what\u2019s available to its absolute limit. For example, Moana is 80 per cent visual effects shots. Compare that to the recent Big Hero 6, which was less than 50 per cent. Most of those effects are water, one of the hardest things there is to animate, and the effects team admitted this movie could not have been processed five years ago. Technologically, it just couldn\u2019t happen. Moana will premiere on December 26. For example, Moana is 80 per cent visual effects shots Given that it's animated, isn't it all visual effects shots?

V In a deeply regrettable attempt to cash in on human tragedy using viral video magic, a company called Miracle Mattress decided to film and post a bizarre commercial promoting its \u201cTwin Tower sale.\u201d Welp!\u000a The 21-second spot was originally posted to Facebook, but it\u2019s since been taken down. Nevertheless, a copy was captured and uploaded to YouTube, where it\u2019s now been viewed more than 700,000 times. It features three chirpy people hyping up the company\u2019s new Twin Tower sale, and it goes about as well as you would expect. \u201cWhat better way to remember 9/11 than with a Twin Tower sale?\u201d the woman asks, punctuating the last three words with slight pauses, presumably so the audience has time to fully register what they\u2019re hearing. At the end, the woman throws her arms back, pretending to push her two male companions into the two towers of stacked mattresses behind them. Then they actually fall down, bringing the mattresses with them. She screams. Then she says, \u201cWe\u2019ll never forget.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what, exactly, the creators were thinking, but it seems plausible that this was an entirely misguided attempt at mining a few minutes of fame from the internet content mines. Of course, the video has gone viral, just not in the way its creators probably hoped. Angry commenters have flocked to Miracle Mattress\u2019s Facebook page to decry the ad, and the company itself has posted an apology. Currently, Miracle Mattress has over two thousand one-star ratings on Facebook, and its Yelp rating sits at a lowly one-and-a-half stars.

p214
VDrought and bark beetle infestations have not been kind to US forests in recent years. California alone has an estimated 66 million dead trees speckling its landscapes and waiting to become wildfire fuel. To prevent that from happening, a pair of scientists has put forth an intriguing, potentially disastrous proposal: burning those trees for energy.  A view from Mt. Fraser, Wyoming, shows thousands of dead and dying trees that have succumbed to bark beetle infestations. Image: Wikimedia Yes, it sounds more than a little dystopian to wean ourselves off fossil fuels by torching our nation\u2019s dying forests, whose plight is due, at least in part, to climate change. But according to a new University of Wyoming-led study published in Energy Policy, this might make economic and environmental sense, because it would give the Forest Service a leg up on the task of clearing out dead fuel to prevent catastrophic wildfires. Other experts, however, think the idea is ludicrous and I\u2019m inclined to agree. Over the years, people have tried to argue that biomass burning is a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, because the fuel source itself (typically, wood) pulls carbon out of the atmosphere as it regenerates. Numerous scientists, however, have spoken out loudly and vehemently against this idea. \u201cWood does not burn clean\u201d, Scott Goetz, deputy director of the the Woods Hole Research Center told Gizmodo. \u201cIn some cases, it\u2019s dirtier than coal. And it takes a long time to grow back the carbon that\u2019s being combusted and emitted.\u201d In other words, biomass fuels are still adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere on a timescale relevant to hitting emissions reduction targets and tackling climate change. And of course, the long-term offset of torching wood for power depends on that wood actually being regrown. If developers put a strip mall where that patch of forest used to be, no dice. Biomass fuels are not going to deliver us a carbon-free future. But in the case of turning the west\u2019s already-dead forest stands into energy, there are a few other factors to consider. For one, this is wood that\u2019s already destined to decompose and release its carbon into the air. And probably rather quickly, either through digestion by voracious bark beetles, or during a wildfire. Which brings us to a second important point: Dead forest stands fuel large, catastrophic fires. By letting thousands of acres of desiccated wood sit on the landscape, we\u2019re opening ourselves up to a much bigger carbon problem, not to mention an enormous risk to humans and property. That\u2019s why the US Forest Service devotes several hundred million dollars a year to prescribed burning, thinning, and other hazardous fuel reduction activities. In other words, we\u2019re already paying money to torch these trees \u2014 we just aren\u2019t reaping any energy benefits. That\u2019s the crux of the argument Erica Belmont and Emily Beagle of the University of Wyoming make in their new paper. Essentially, their analysis shows that while it wouldn\u2019t make financial sense for power companies to go around looting the forest for dead trees just to do it, the economics start to become favourable when you consider the fact that removing dead wood could effectively subsidise wildfire prevention. What\u2019s more, the researchers say, existing power plants could co-fire woody biomass with coal. Doing so might help them meet new energy targets stipulated by Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which if enacted, will require states to reduce power plant carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. This is where the authors start to lose me. Their argument assumes the regulatory framework of the Clean Power Plan would allow power companies to substitute one dirty energy source for another dirty energy source \u2026 with the potential for a long-term carbon offset. It\u2019s basically assuming the atmosphere will right itself the future, which is already our MO when it comes to climate change, and it hasn\u2019t been working out so well. Goetz brought up one other pretty serious problem with this idea: removing dead trees is disruptive. If requires lots of heavy machinery and service roads. It compacts soil, raises a hell of a racket, and removes nutrients that would otherwise be recycled into the Earth. Doing so might actually make it harder for dead forest stands to regenerate in the future. So, at the end of the day, while the potential to reduce hazardous fuels is certainly food for thought, I\u2019m going to say the ecological rewards of hauling millions of trees out of the woods probably don\u2019t outweigh the risks. We\u2019ve reached out to the study authors for comment and will update if we hear back. Finally, it\u2019s important to bear in mind that from an energy perspective, this is at best a stop-gap solution that doesn\u2019t address the underlying problem: we need to get off carbon-based fuels if we\u2019re to prevent catastrophic climate change. [The Washington Post] When in a hole, stop digging. Those trees are dangerous.  Time to get rid of them all for the safety of our children and a prosperous future for the planet. Noone is ever going to make all the cleanies happy, one goal achieved, they just shift the goalposts.  Better send the envirofascists to mars (and the remnant trees), we can watch and see how permaculture works on a virgin-global scale.

Far too many members of our society are simply not capable of working out why their culture is better than cultures which would see them destroyed.  Worse yet, our SJWs are hellbent on convincing them that other cultures are just as good, despite the fact many other cultures are loathsome!

V It can be a bummer when gorgeous weather beckons you to go outside and you suddenly find your adventurous spirit hampered by your one true enemy: allergies. Why is it that harmless plants seem to attack our senses? And why are only some of us affected?\u000a In this TED-Ed lesson by Eleanor Nelson, we learn that our immune systems basically just confuse harmless pollen and mould spores with something potentially dangerous like bacteria, and the unpleasant allergic reaction we experience is our body on the defence. Allergies tend to run in families, so there might be a genetic component as to which allergens affect you, and where you grow up also plays a factor. Being exposed to allergens as a baby makes you less likely to develop an allergy to it later on (but that doesn\u2019t mean you should send your baby out rolling in the weeds). The hygiene hypothesis posits that a lack of childhood exposure to microorganisms and parasites causes the immune system to over-eagerly attack harmless substances. The simplest way to combat your allergies are antihistamines, which diminish the inflammation response. Apparently hook worms also can be used to treat allergies (which also might be why allergies are less common in developing countries where hook worms are more prevalent), but you probably shouldn\u2019t trade your allergies for worms just yet. Why do people have seasonal allergies? [TED-Ed]

p222
VThe latest episode of Fear the Walking Dead gave the TWD universe yet another term for the mindless, deceased, flesh-eating monsters that have brought civilisation to its knees: The Wasted. It\u2019s pretty good, but is it the best term used to describe zombies in these shows? Not quite.\u000a\u000a1) Rotters If you were forced to boil zombies down to a single, defining characteristic, chances are it would be the fact that they\u2019re dead. Thus \u201cRotters\u201d is a simple and elegant term for them, but one that is still distinctly evocative of the fact that you\u2019re dealing with a corpse. 2) Biters Also simple and elegant, just not as rich as \u201cRotters\u201d. Given that both pets and children with temper issues can and have often been similarly described robs this description of some of its power. 3) Creepers Compared to rotting and biting, creeping seems almost benign in comparison\u2026 almost. But creeping is still intrinsically sinister, and what it fails in adequately describing zombies\u2019 truest proclivities it makes up for in letting people know they should watch out for them. 4) The Wasted As mentioned above, this is the newest addition to zombie nomenclature, given to us by the latest episode of Fear the Walking Dead. While there\u2019s a chance that others may think you\u2019re talking about people being drunk, at least it\u2019s poetic. 5) Skin Eaters Sure, zombies rarely stop at the skin when eating a person, so this term isn\u2019t terribly accurate. Still, it does warn people that these things will eat at least a portion of your flesh if given a chance. 6) Lurkers Lurking is the lamer, less sinister version of creeping. Still, better \u201clurkers\u201d than \u201cskulkers\u201d or \u201cloiterers\u201d, I suppose. 7) Geeks Daryl calls zombies this once in season two, presumably hearkening back to the term\u2019s original meaning of a circus freak who ate live animals. Unfortunately, the modern world has long since left that definition behind, instead using it for pop culture-obsessed nerds. Now that civilisation has collapsed, Daryl is trying to bring it back, but I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to win this battle. 8) Dead Ones I suppose it stands to reason that someone without a sliver of imagination survived the zombie apocalypse. But can\u2019t you at least call them \u201cthe dead\u201d? Why \u201cthe dead ones\u201d? Literally no one is going to be confused is you just refer to them as \u201cthe dead\u201d. 9) Walkers The preferred term for zombies, courtesy of one Rick Grimes. I understand that it\u2019s tied to the title of the TV show, but walking is hardly the most interesting aspect of these undead creatures that want to eat human flesh, Rick. Also, walkers are what you call those rolly-seat-things that toddlers use to get used to walking, which is really hard to forget once you remember it. 11) Roamers Guys. Zombies aren\u2019t hobos riding the rails, searching for a warm meal and a place to bed down for the night. You should at least try to make them sound a little scary. 12) Lamebrains Actually, if The Walking Dead\u2018s zombies specifically ate brains, like the titular creatures of Return of the Living Dead, I think this term would have a certain ironic zest. But they don\u2019t, so it isn\u2019t. 13) Cold Bodies Apparently this is what the inhabitants of Terminus called zombies \u2014 basically, their \u201ccold lunches\u201d as opposed to the \u201chot lunches\u201d of the living. It may have worked for their cannibalistic town, but it\u2019s still a dumb, dumb name for zombies. 14) Floaters If you\u2019re living in the zombie apocalypse and have lost loved ones to the undead plague, then I can see hating zombies with every fibre of your being. But still, that doesn\u2019t mean you should be OK with calling zombies names that are also used to describe certain types of poop. It\u2019s far more embarrassing to you than to them. [H/t Mental Floss] 12) Lamebrains Actually, if The Walking Dead\u2018s zombies specifically ate brains, like the titular creatures of Return of the Living Dead, I think this term would have a certain ironic zest. But they don\u2019t, so it isn\u2019t. Lamebrain is a bit of an oldschool word for stupid. Basically if you were calling someone a Lamebrain you were calling them an idiot. Which seems to suit zombies fine as they are more or less mindless and only fixated on one thing. that geeks one is very interesting. i had no idea it was an olden-times term. Indeed. You learn something new every day. But then the author re-defines 'geek' as a subset of 'nerd'. Blasphemy! where does 'poindexter' fall in the mentioned categories and subsets?

When I started climbing I was overweight, bored and perennially grumpy. Climbing helped change all that. I lost weight, changed my diet \u2014 I became a better person. Climbing gave me something important: a meaningful distraction from every day life.  Bad day at work: climbing. Argument with wife: climbing. Existential crises: climbing. Part of the appeal: the brute exertion, the endorphin release that comes from intense exercise. But of most benefit? Time spent connected to the present moment. Climbing demands your complete focus: it\u2019s physical but cerebral. Where is my foot? How should my body be positioned? Where should my hips be? What movement should I be making next? Climbing is forced meditation and I\u2019ve been reaping the benefits of that for the past five years. Back to that goal I mentioned. Not long after I started climbing, a friend of mine told me about a route \u2014 \u2018Seventh Day Ascentist\u2019, a climb buried in a reserve in Baulkham Hills in NSW, ten minutes from my house. A clever play on words \u2014 it was brought up as a joke. I consider myself agnostic, but my wife \u2013 she\u2019s an actual practicing Seventh Day Adventist. The friends I started climbing with, they were also Seventh Day Adventists I\u2019d met through my wife.  We had a right old laugh about the route. Seventh Day Ascentist. Good one. \u201cMaybe one day we\u2019ll be able to climb it,\u201d we said. We laughed even harder. That was an even bigger joke. At that point in time we were novices and Seventh Day Ascentist was a climb graded at V9. In layman\u2019s terms: really fucking hard. The idea that we might actually be able to climb a route so difficult was literally hilarious at the time.  But the climb stuck with me. Partly because of the pun, mostly because I thought it might be funny to arrive home after a Saturday spent climbing to tell my wife \u2014 who goes to church on a Saturday \u2014 that I just climbed a route called Seventh Day Ascentist. Yeah, nah. A V9? Forget about it. I was struggling to get up V3s in the gym. An outdoor V9 seemed like fantasy. I kept climbing. My friends stopped, but I didn\u2019t. I made new friends at my climbing gym and quickly became obsessed with getting better, stronger, more accomplished. I trained constantly. I changed the way I ate. I read training manuals. I bored my family and friends to death. I thought about climbing constantly. My life became one long drawn out Rocky montage.  And I saw the results. I went from pushing 80kgs to around 67kgs. I slowly moved up the climbing grades. By the middle of 2015 I\u2019d climbed a handful of V7s and a few soft V8s.  In the back of my mind I started saying to myself, \u201chey, maybe Seventh Day Ascentist is possible?\u201d I gave Seventh Day Ascentist a quick try in August 2015 and it was a big fat fail. Hilariously, Seventh Day Ascentist was about as far removed from my style as you could possibly imagine. My strengths: strong fingers, an ability to move powerfully on small holds. My weaknesses: core strength and flexibility. I suck at roof climbing. I can barely touch my toes on a good day.  And surprise surprise: Seventh Day Ascentist has a roof section that requires a strong core and some seriously dexterous hip flexors. Bollocks. But regardless, at the beginning of 2016, I set a little goal for myself. In winter, during climbing season, I\u2019d dedicate a sustained amount of time. I\u2019d train specifically for this route and give Seventh Day Ascentist my best goddamn shot.  Looking back it\u2019s almost silly how seriously I took it. I trained constantly. I trained my core for particular movements: front levers to give myself a decent shot at the roof section, therabands for the rotation required to twist my body and then hold tension. I was constantly doing hip flexor stretches, just so I could find it easier to complete one singular move on the wall.  I lost weight. Like even more weight. To the point where my wife started drawing the line. \u201cGo under 65kgs and we\u2019re getting a divorce,\u201d she said. For a good couple of weeks I was sitting at 64kg or below. I didn\u2019t mention this to my wife. I fell off Seventh Day Ascentist a lot. Like a lot a lot. I estimate I must have fallen off this route hundreds of times, and 70% of those falls were on one specific move. It was shocking to me how many times I fell. A small part of me expected it to be easy. I was in the best climbing shape of my life, I had trained specifically for this route. I fully expected to walk up to the route on the first day, fall off a couple of times as I re-learned the moves, and then climb it with relative ease. That didn\u2019t happen. Not even close.  I didn\u2019t climb Seventh Day Ascentist on the first day as planned. I didn\u2019t send the route on the second day either. Or the third or the fourth or the fifth. No, I climbed Seventh Day Ascentist on the seventh day. Because of course I did. On that day I made two slight adjustments \u2013 that was all it took. I changed one foot position. I changed one open hand to a full crimp. Suddenly a move that seemed impossible was now absolutely possible.  Then, just like that, I finally climbed Seventh Day Ascentist. It seems silly, and I\u2019m embarrassed to type it, but at the top, after swearing and screaming for a couple of minutes, I almost started sobbing.  I finished Seventh Day Ascentist on what was almost certainly my last attempt at the climb that day \u2013 and possibly my last attempt for a month or two. On my successful attempt, I actually came precariously close to slipping off \u2013 a slipped foot \u2014 pure nerves really. The sheer relief was overwhelming. And it\u2019s almost hard to explain why. I was hardly the first to climb Seventh Day Ascentist. Most likely, hundreds have climbed this route. There was nothing special about my ascent. When I posted the above video on Facebook, my Dad\u2019s comment: \u201cit\u2019s hardly the north face of the Eiger.\u201d  That about summed it up really.  But it was my own stupid, personal investment \u2014 that\u2019s what mattered. I what I believed was an impossible goal and actually achieved it.  I\u2019d gone through a terrible week at work the day I finally climbed Seventh Day Ascentist. I remember the walk home. I remember this overwhelming feeling: I could achieve anything I set my mind to (within reason). A second, perhaps more important realisation: work didn\u2019t define me as a person.  A meaningless achievement. It didn\u2019t matter, but in the grand scheme, what does matter? After months and months of struggle I\u2019d made this pointless goal a reality. That felt powerful. It\u2019s a feeling I\u2019ve tried to apply to all aspects of my life. If I could drag my shitty 35-year-old body up that slab of rock, what else could I achieve?  I walked home. A good 30 minute walk. As I strode up the hill back home, my wife drove past, waving excitedly. She was on her way to church. It was Saturday. According to Adventists, Saturday is the day of rest. According to Adventists, Saturday is the seventh day. I wish I loved something as much as you love porri- I mean rock climbing, Mark Haha, that toe catch halfway through. So close. Love it - I wish more people found something to be passionate about instead of watching reality television and hurling insults at those who pursue their hobbies come passions. Many people, interestingly, find this level of commitment and passion in individual physical pursuits like climbing, weightlifting, crossfit, etc, and it's transformative. I can certainly relate. Keep up the great work. Congratulations on your achievement! There is no point to any hobby apart from making you happy. Thus, there is no need to dig deeper to look for philosopical or logical reasons as to why hobbies are good. I am into some obscure sports such as squash and long distance running. They make me happy. That is all I need to know.

VOn Thursday, federal regulators announced that they were slapping Wells Fargo with a $US100 ($131) million penalty after discovering employees created hundreds of thousands of bank accounts and credit cards in customers\u2019 names without their knowledge, costing account holders an estimated $US2.5 ($3) million in fees.  Photo: AP According to the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 5,300 Wells Fargo employees have been fired for using \u201cimproper sales practices,\u201d which included transferring customers\u2019 funds into newly created, unauthorised accounts to meet incentivized sales goals. In other cases, employees secretly applied for credit cards, signed up for online banking and activated debit cards in customers\u2019 names. In a 2013 L.A. Times story credited with first uncovering the scheme, former Wells Fargo employees claimed that managers coached workers on how to artificially raise sales numbers to meet the \u201crelentless pressure\u201d of sales quotas: \u000a\u201cThey\u2019d just tell the customers: \u2018You\u2019re getting a credit card,'\u201d [former banker Erick] Estrada said. He admitted to opening unneeded accounts, though never without a customer\u2019s knowledge, he said.\u000a \u000aWhen customers complained about the unwanted credit cards, the branch manager would blame a computer glitch or say the card had been requested by someone with a similar name, Estrada said.\u000a \u000aOne former branch manager who worked in the Pacific Northwest described her dismay at discovering that employees had talked a homeless woman into opening six checking and savings accounts with fees totaling $US39 ($51) a month.\u000a \u000a\u201cIt\u2019s all manipulation. We are taught exactly how to sell multiple accounts,\u201d the former manager said. \u201cIt sounds good, but in reality it doesn\u2019t benefit most customers.\u201d\u000a \u201cThis widespread practice gave the employees credit for opening the new accounts, allowing them to earn additional compensation and to meet the bank\u2019s sales goals,\u201d said the CFPB in a press release. \u201cConsumers, in turn, were sometimes harmed because the bank charged them for insufficient funds or overdraft fees because the money was not in their original accounts.\u201d An analysis commissioned by Wells Fargo found that some 1,534,280 deposit accounts and 565,443 credit card applications may have been created without customers\u2019 knowledge since 2011. In addition to the $US100 ($131) million fine \u2014 the largest handed out by the CFPB since it was created after the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 Wells Fargo has agreed to conduct a comprehensive, independent review of sales practices and pay refunds to all affected customers, who will not be required to take action. At least one former financial regulator, however, questioned whether the penalty was large enough for a bank worth over $US250 ($327) billion. \u201cIt sounds like a big number, but for a bank the size of Wells Fargo, it isn\u2019t really,\u201d David Vladeck, the former director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, told CNN. In a statement on Thursday, Wells Fargo said it has set aside $US5 ($7) million for refunds to customers, 100,000 of whom have already been repaid. \u201cWells Fargo is committed to putting our customers\u2019 interests first 100% of the time, and we regret and take responsibility for any instances where customers may have received a product that they did not request,\u201d said the bank.

p230
VBy the mercy of some higher power, the giant panda \u2014 an oversized mashup between a raccoon and a sloth whose offspring can\u2019t poop on their own \u2014 is no longer endangered. At a meeting of the World Conservation Congress in Hawaii this weekend, experts took giant pandas off the IUCN\u2019s official Red List, citing a population rebound in China.\u000a\u000aImage: National Geographic/YouTube That\u2019s right: Thanks to a concerted effort on the part of the Chinese government to prevent its national icon from dying, the population of giant pandas in the wild has increased some 17 per cent in recent years, reaching over 2000 individuals for the first time in decades. The rebound, which has now seen pandas officially reclassified as \u201cvulnerable\u201d, can be attributed to an increase in the amount of bamboo forest, and stricter anti-poaching measures. \u201cJust by restoring the panda\u2019s habitat, that\u2019s given them back their space and made food available to them,\u201d Craig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN Red List, told the BBC. But the future for giant pandas is by no means secure. As the Washington Post noted last autumn, while the amount of panda-friendly bamboo forest has indeed increased, new habitats are patchy, isolated and can only support a few dozen individuals each. Of the 33 separate panda populations that existed in China as of 2015, 18 had fewer than 10 individuals and faced a \u201chigh risk of extinction\u201d. China is attempting to solve this problem with new wildlife reserves, but its own panda experts aren\u2019t sure that they have made enough progress yet to merit a reclassification. What\u2019s more, as climate change progresses, roughly a third of the potential bamboo habitat available for pandas is expected to disappear. Still, any conservation success stories ought to be applauded this day and age, if only to remind us that human beings do have the capacity to effect positive change in the natural world. And while some have argued that we should just let pandas die already, I\u2019d like to submit this video, of Chinese zookeepers donning dollar store panda onesies and spraying them with actual panda urine, as proof that love don\u2019t come easy, and that anybody who wants to give up on the animal behind world\u2019s most adorable sushi roll is a monster.  [BBC] They're lovely creatures, but I'd like to raise a question:\u000aPandas have some terrible genetic disadvantages.\u000ae.g.\u000aThey suck at mating.\u000aTheir young die of constipation if they aren't forced to defecate.\u000aThe crap they eat has almost no nutritional value. Should we look at genetically addressing some of their issues? Lol. That's exactly what I was thinking. They suck at Life. These are only challenges for captive breeders not for the species itself. As a species they're perfectly ok, they did well enough to survive for hundreds of thousands of years. But against humans destroying their habitat and poaching them they die off just the same as most creatures. So, you'd accept that as an argument against fixing Alzheimer's-inducing genes in humans? That's false equivalence. As I said; those issue are only problems with captive breeding. If they don't need that anymore they they're not issues and these genetic engineering suggestions are pointless. The issues then go back to habitat protection and poaching.\u000aWhereas Alzheimer's is always an issue with humans. 1: All three issues I raised are problems in the wild. 2: I raised Alzheimers to make the point that arguments about the success of the species do not exhaust the arguments for helping a species.  Alzheimers has negligible impact on the success of the human species, most sufferers are well past the age of procreation, but you presumably still think it should be genetically fixed. But how do they taste? Probably like over cooked chicken KFP? I hear that China is a great place for startups, you should defs give it a go :) I don't know, but if your sexual proclivities take you in that direction I hope you and your panda lover enjoy yourselves. I'm not sure how you eat food but if you equate tasting to "sexual proclivities" then I worry for your lover (human, panda or otherwise) and suggest you decline invitations to wine or food tastings. Sure man, go "taste" your panda ;) The other other other other white meat I heard the chinese are breeding pandas for consumption.

VIn their first interview since taking over the DC Films, the men put in charge of righting the ship after Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad admitted that the tone of the previous films has been wrong \u2014 and as a result, many changes are being made.\u000a Those men are Geoff Johns and Jon Berg, the DC Comics chief creative officer and Warner Bros. executive, respectively, who are now in charge of the DC Films slate, which includes Justice League, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman and many others. \u201c[I]n the past, I think the studio has said, \u2018Oh, DC films are gritty and dark and that\u2019s what makes them different.\u2019 That couldn\u2019t be more wrong,\u201d Johns told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s a hopeful and optimistic view of life. Even Batman has a glimmer of that in him. If he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d make tomorrow better, he\u2019d stop.\u201d The pair admitted many of those changes are first going to be first seen in Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League, which is almost done filming for a November 2017 release. Berg admitted after seeing the reactions to Batman v Superman, they \u201caccelerated the [Justice League] story to get to the hope and optimism a little faster.\u201d That film will also \u201cdirectly address Batman\u2019s extreme actions in [Batman v Superman], such as torturing criminals and nearly killing the Man of Steel, rather than accept them as par for the course.\u201d That\u2019s similar to what happened in Batman v Superman, which addressed Superman\u2019s inadvertent destruction of the city of Metropolis during Man of Steel for its first act. In addition to overseeing all the films, Johns is working more directly on a few of them. We already knew he was writing the Batman solo film for Ben Affleck to star and direct, but he also did a rewrite on Patty Jenkins\u2019 Wonder Woman film, which will be the next one out. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take a really hard look at everything to make sure we stay true to the characters and tell stories that celebrate them,\u201d Johns said. Wonder Woman is out June 2, 2017. Justice League (which will now not be a two-part story) is out November 17, 2017. [Wall Street Journal] They were just really shit movies. Lex Luthor acting like Sheldon from big bang theory was pretty hilarious to watch though. I really enjoyed them First time I saw it, I would fully agree, but in followup viewings, when I was prepared for Luthor werent so bad.  Dont know why, its a terrible performance and Eisenberg seemed to be channeling his inner Joker rather than Luthor, but it was more palatable the second time around. BvS isnt brilliant, not by a long shot, but most of its problems are from people expecting DC to be as good as Marvel right from the start.  Marvel got lucky with Iron Man being so good, but people forget Hulk being pretty terrible, and are very forgiving of a fairly ordinary Thor and Capt America because of the good will built up.  DC doesnt get that same luxury. Made worse by Civil War effectively telling the same story so much better... "DC doesn't get that same luxury" because they haven't yet made enjoyable films in their universe. The Thor's and Hulks and slow/nonsensical plot points in the marvel universe are largely forgotten or brushed aside because the vast majority of the MCU has been enjoyable. If Wonder Woman and Justice League become massive hits and return to making the characters we love (like a batman that doesn't just shoot his enemies with a sniper rifle) we will all quickly forget the sins of the past, and happily forgive future missteps as well. Just as we have with the MCU. Well when the only good DC crossover is on TV in a year when you had a BvS movie, you need to change something. Definitely encouraging. I hated BvS in the cinema but actually like the Ultimate cut a lot, but it still has major flaws. Johns is definitely right in his approach, going by his time writing and his recent Rebirth stuff, he's more than likely the kick up the arse WB and the DCEU needs.

VThe eFOLDI scooter is now looking for funding on Kickstarter We write a lot about personal transport. About hoverboards, about electric bikes and electric scooters to name but a few. There are some really great products out there, but many of them fail to make it into the mainstream for whatever reason \u2013 either because they are too expensive or because of legislation that prevents their use on UK roads. But here\u2019s a product that looks genuinely interesting and innovative. It\u2019s the eFOLDI multi-functional e-scooter. \u000aOK it\u2019s perhaps not the prettiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen, looking like a bit like a disability scooter (maybe a few different colours would be nice). But I can see how it could catch on \u2013 primarily as an electric vehicle of course, though it could also be used for storage or as a chair at, say, a sporting event such as kid\u2019s football match etc. The brainchild of a father and daughter team with a combined 66 years of engineering experience, the eFOLDi is battery powered, relatively lightweight at 19kg, has USB ports and a top speed of 20 km/h. At the front is one 12inch tyre while at the rear are two 10inch wheels. Features include LED indicators at the front and brake lights at the rear. The winner of British Invention 2016 at Gadget Show Live last week, the eFOLDI is currently looking to crowdfund production on Kickstarter here. At the time of writing it has raised just over £13,000 of its £90,000 target with each scooter costing £699 (full retail price is expected to be £1599 with launch in October).   The electric mobility scooters have done wonders for various people. but could you tell me which is the best for people with disability? A wheelchair or electric mobility scooter.

Geoff Johns confirmed the casting as well as Deathstroke\u2019s role in the Batman movie, first reported by The Wrap, to the Wall Street Journal in an interview today.

Manganiello was rumoured for the role almost immediately after Affleck first revealed the footage, thanks to the actor\u2019s presence in London (and, of course, because he followed director Zack Snyder on Twitter).

VWhen Arrow got its hands on Task Force X, fans were excited to see part of DC comics lore on the show. Then the Suicide Squad movie got announced, and Arrow very quickly had to stop using the characters. Fans have long assumed the movie killed Arrow\u2018s plans for the team, but apparently the movie was responsible for their appearance in the first place.\u000a Another part of Greg Berlanti\u2019s extensive Vulture interview released this week saw the producer discuss how the TV shows can be a proving grounds for the movies and for comics characters to be considered for live-action. According to Berlanti, Task Force X was brought onto the show at Warner Bros.\u2019 request, in order to familiarise people with the characters before the movie began: \u000aTo what extent are the comics R&D for the TV and movie properties? Does DC Comics president Geoff Johns come to you and say, \u201cHey, here\u2019s something we tried out in a comic. Let\u2019s try it here\u201d?\u000a \u000aSometimes, or he has other executives mention that to us. They said to us a year and a half before they started developing Suicide Squad, \u201cWill you guys put [a version of] the Suicide Squad in your show? Because we want to have it as a film at some point.\u201d\u000a \u000aIt also happened with Geoff when Geoff and Andrew [Kreisberg] and I were creating Flash.They were both really huge fans of Cisco Ramon, [also known as] Vibe, and had written a Vibe comic [in 2013] to try and bring him back. They said, \u201cCould we please have Vibe on the show?\u201d\u000a This is somewhat unexpected, given how much WB/DC has made it clear they want to keep their show and movie universe very separate. But it\u2019s interesting that they were only really added as a test run for what ended up being a radically different take on Task Force X. I guess if a DC character suddenly appears on Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, or Legends of Tomorrow only to just as quickly vanish, you can expect them to get a DC movie in the not so distant future.

VIt\u2019s no fun to lose power for hours or days, especially if you end up having to throw out the food in your fridge. If you know a big storm is coming, you can keep food safe longer by filling your freezer with jugs of water.\u000a\u000aPhoto via Visual hunt. A full freezer stays cold for 48 hours, while a half-empty freezer can only be trusted for about 24. (Don\u2019t completely pack the freezer, though: make sure there\u2019s a little space for air to circulate.) A refrigerator only keeps its temperature for about four hours, and that\u2019s assuming you don\u2019t open the doors. Before the storm comes, you can use items from your refrigerator to fill your freezer. That preserves those items a little longer while also helping to keep the freezer cold. Containers of water are your best bet to use up the rest of the space: they\u2019re bigger and cheaper than gel ice packs, and they can be a backup source of drinking water. While you\u2019re preparing, pick up a refrigerator thermometer to keep tabs on the temperature: freezers should stay below -17.7 degrees, and a safe refrigerator is 4.4 or below.

V People are always looking for the best way to keep their produce fresh longer, and some companies make plastic storage containers that claim to do that. But they aren\u2019t cheap. And while they technically work, you\u2019re probably better off saving the $US50 ($65) you\u2019d likely spend on a full set.\u000a Consumer Reports tested seven different produce storage containers that claim to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables \u2014 including the popular Oxo Good Grips Greensaver and Rubbermaid Fresh Works containers \u2014 to see if they really keep things fresh longer. As it turns out, they\u2019re about as effective as any other container out there. In fact, as Bernie Dietrick explains in the video above from the Consumer Reports YouTube channel, the plastic clam shells your produce usually comes pre-packed in works equally as well. That said, if you buy in bulk and want to keep a large quantity of a certain fruit or vegetable together in one container, these products may still warrant a purchase. Otherwise, just use what you get for free. Besides, according to Consumer Reports\u2019 Ellen Klosz, what matters most is actually your refrigerator, its settings, and where you store things inside of it.

VWhen there\u2019s nothing on TV, and it\u2019s raining outside, and you\u2019re bored of your toys, every kid always has one reliable way to entertain themselves: Pretend the floor is lava and do anything you can to cross a room without stepping on it. It used to require a healthy imagination, until someone turned the idea into a video game.\u000a\u000aHot Lava, coming soon to the Steam store, takes the traditional first person shooter in a new direction. Instead of shooting your way through a level, you need to carefully navigate between obstacles, like coffee tables, sofas and other furniture, that are all precariously floating atop a lava flow.  From the looks of it, Hot Lava will require lightning fast reflexes, both when it comes to sticking your landings, but also when it comes to hitting the quick-save key so you\u2019re not constantly restarting from the beginning every time you land in the lava.

VThe heat can make your usual workout a lot more difficult. It also puts you at risk of heatstroke if you\u2019re not careful. If you want to get your sweat on when it\u2019s burning up outside, adjusting your intervals can make it a little easier and safer.\u000a Photo by Luisen Rodrigo. If possible, Brad Stulberg at Outside suggests you do your workout when it\u2019s cooler out and sunlight isn\u2019t as prominent. But sometimes you can only sneak a run in at lunch, so Stulberg recommends adjusting your work-rest cycles, or implementing some if you don\u2019t have any to begin with. For example, if you do two 20-minute intervals with a five minute rest in between, switch it up to four 10-minute intervals with eight minute rests in between. If you normally go for a half hour run, consider changing it to two 15 minute runs with a 10-minute rest period in between. Get in the shade and give yourself some time to cool down. And don\u2019t worry about not getting a good workout because of the rest periods. The heat is making your body work harder than normal, so you\u2019re still doing plenty. This is especially helpful if you\u2019re trying to adapt your body to the heat of the summer, or you just moved to a warmer location. It takes time to build up your heat resistance, so don\u2019t push yourself too hard. Your Body In Extreme Heat [Outside Online]

VA blue-ribbon panel commissioned by the Obama administration has released a report describing 10 transformative research strategies designed to increase the speed at which cancer research is conducted \u2014 but it\u2019s not clear if US Congress will commit the necessary funds.\u000a\u000aVice President Joseph Biden speaks at the Cancer Moonshot Summit at Howard University in Washington on 29 June 2016. (Image: AP) The 28-member Blue Ribbon panel presented its report to the National Cancer Advisory Board earlier today. To come up with its recommendations, the committee organised several working groups involving some 150 experts, who focused on such topics as paediatric cancer, improved data sharing and clinical trials.  In total, the panel made 10 recommendations which it believes represents the \u201cmost compelling\u201d opportunities available to speed progress against the disease; the ultimate goal of the Cancer Moonshot initiative is to make \u201ca decade\u2019s worth of research progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment in just five years\u201d and to \u201cbring the most promising science and clinical developments to cancer patients in the near term\u201d. The 10 recommendations are as follows (a full description of each item can be found here, along with accompanying summary videos): It\u2019s a diversified strategy, one that recognises the need to merge science, technology, advocacy, social science and big data. Vice President Joseph Biden, who lost a son to brain cancer more than a year ago, is leading this campaign, pledging, \u201cI plan to do two things: increase resources \u2014 both private and public \u2014 to fight cancer, and break down silos and bring all the cancer fighters together \u2014 to work together, share information, and end cancer as we know it.\u201d Importantly, the recommendations stress the need to create a clinical trial network dedicated to immunotherapy \u2014 a revolutionary new line of research that leverages the body\u2019s own immune system to to fight cancer. The proposal to increase testing for hereditary cancer syndromes is likewise prudent, as these conditions are known to increase risk for breast, colon and other cancers. The proposals are appropriately ambitious given that cancer claims 45,700 Australian lives and 600,000 American lives each year, but as the Washington Post makes clear, the recommendations come at an uncertain time: \u000aMany of the ideas would require millions \u2014 if not hundreds of millions \u2014 of dollars in additional funding, but Congress has not yet approved any extra spending for the moonshot effort. And within the cancer community itself, federal officials are still struggling to overcome scepticism that the moonshot will result in breakthroughs against [the disease]\u2026.\u000a And with the US election just a few months away, time is ticking on the Obama administration to put these recommendations in action, lest it drop the ball on its promise to make a meaningful and lasting impact on the war against cancer.

VA lot of times in Star Trek, we tend to focus on the captains. After all, it\u2019s their ship, right? Everyone else is just following orders. But I think it\u2019s high time the second-in-commands got their day in the captain\u2019s chair \u2014 after all, the heroine of the newest Star Trek TV series will be among their ranks.\u000a\u000aStar Trek: Discovery showrunner Bryan Fuller appeared on Nerd World Report last week and said the protagonist of the next Star Trek series would be called \u201cNumber One\u201d. This confirmed what we already knew about the main character, that she would be a commanding officer but not the captain of her ship. Number One was originally a moniker adopted by the Royal Navy to describe a first officer or second-in-command on a ship. (It\u2019s also one of Captain Picard\u2019s favourite things to yell out as he\u2019s entering or leaving a room.) Fuller said the name choice is actually an homage to Star Trek\u2018s original Number One from the unaired pilot. However, every single Star Trek series has had a dynamic second-in-command, each with their own story and perspective. Star Trek: The Original Series unaired pilot, \u201cThe Cage\u201d\u000aPlayed by: Majel Barrett Number One, the unnamed character from \u201cThe Cage\u201d, was Pike\u2019s first lieutenant who defied her alien captors and helmed the ship in the captain\u2019s absence. She was calm, cool-headed and didn\u2019t let her emotions get in the of her duty. According to creator Gene Roddenberry, NBC didn\u2019t like that. They felt it would be best not to have a woman in a leadership role on a starship, because it would make audiences uncomfortable. Producer Herbert Solow denied it in his book, Star Trek: The Real Story, saying it was actually because Roddenberry and Barrett were having an affair. However, NBC still insisted Roddenberry give the role to a man. Roddenberry ended up using a lot of Number One\u2019s traits for Spock\u2019s character, and Barrett stayed on as a vital part of the Star Trek franchise. She voiced the computer for most of the Star Trek series and films. She also played Nurse (later Doctor) Christine Chapel on The Original Series and Ambassador Lwaxana Troi, Deanna Troi\u2019s mother, on The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. Footage of Barrett\u2019s role as Number One was later used in the \u201cMenagerie\u201d episode of The Original Series. Star Trek: The Original Series\u000aPlayed by: Leonard Nimoy / Zachary Quinto Spock was the only recurring character to transition from the unaired pilot to Star Trek: The Original Series. The half-Vulcan, half-human science officer is one of the most distinguished members of the federation. Working alongside Captain James T. Kirk, we saw Spock (whose first name is apparently impossible for humans to pronounce) settle into a role as the calm and logical one, to balance out Kirk\u2019s brashness. But he wasn\u2019t completely devoid of emotion, given the fact that he was half human. Spock quickly became a fan favourite and a sex symbol, with actor William Shatner sometimes fearing that Spock was overshadowing him on the series. In fact, the show\u2019s controversial interracial kiss was originally supposed to be between Uhura and Spock, but Shatner asked for it be him instead. Even though Leonard Nimoy always had a love-hate relationship with the character of Spock (he especially hated the ears), he still recognised how important the character was, and still is, for millions of Star Trek fans. After the series ended, he said, \u201cIf I had to be someone else, I would be Spock.\u201d Star Trek: The Next Generation\u000aPlayed by: Jonathan Frakes, Jonathan Frakes\u2019 beard The quintessential \u201cNumber One\u201d, Captain Picard called Riker that so many times I swear we almost forgot his name. Commander Riker definitely went through some changes over the course of the series. In the first couple of seasons, he was the young, hot-headed first officer to balance out Captain Picard\u2019s calm demeanour. However, over time he became more patient and reserved, learning and growing from Picard\u2019s leadership. Through it all, Riker\u2019s loyalty to the Enterprise was never in question. He repeatedly turned down offers of his own command, only accepting one at the end of Star Trek: Nemesis. His loyalty to the cast is also famous. The Next Generation cast continually calls him the best director they ever had on the series. One of the most famous things about Commander Riker was his beard. Riker was clean-shaven for the first season of the show, but between seasons he acted in a Civil War mini-series, so he grew a beard. Gene Roddenberry thought it looked \u201cmore nautical\u201d so he told Frakes to keep it. That beard is synonymous with TNG\u2019s improved show quality, hence the phrase \u201cgrowing the beard\u201d (the opposite of \u201cjumping the shark\u201d). Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\u000aPlayed by: Nana Visitor Kira Nerys was not a part of Starfleet, but that\u2019s exactly why Commander (later Captain) Sisko wanted her on board. When the Federation agreed to keep an eye on Bajor after the Cardassians retreated, Sisko requested a Bajoran first officer onboard the Deep Space Nine outpost to improve relationships with the budding government. Kira Nerys, a former underground revolutionary, started out as stubborn and hot-headed, opposed to the Federation\u2019s presence in the Bajoran province. Over time, she and Sisko developed a warm and loving friendship of mutual respect \u2014 thanks in no small part to Sisko\u2019s role as the emissary to the Prophets. One of Kira\u2019s most defining qualities was her unquestionable faith. Throughout her entire life, her faith in the Prophets was what kept her going through occupation, slavery and the resistance. It showed a softer, more compassionate side of the character, but it also came with its problems. Mainly, when Kira put faith before duty, like when she defended teaching Bajoran creationism in public school. She did grow to be more tolerant over the series, but her faith didn\u2019t waver. Side note, the producers of the series originally wanted Ensign Ro Laren to play Sisko\u2019s first officer in Deep Space Nine, but the actress refused the role, so they created a new (and much better) character instead. Star Trek: Voyager\u000aPlayed by: Robert Beltran Umm\u2026 well\u2026 yikes. Where do I start with this guy? He was Native American, I guess, and he had a cool face tattoo. Let\u2019s face it, Chakotay was boring. And, if you go by the criticisms from people in the Native American community, divisive. Some praised his role as ground breaking, others compared him to Tonto from The Lone Ranger. Chakotay was a Maquis fighter who, alongside his crew, got pulled some 70,000 light years away into the Delta Quadrant, where the group joined forces with the Voyager to ensure their mutual survival. Captain Kathryn Janeway gave Chakotay the field commission of Lieutenant Commander, hoping to close the divide between the Federation officers and Maquis rebels. Chakotay served as Janeway\u2019s quasi-enforcer on the ship. He wouldn\u2019t tolerate any bull from those serving under him, and was not afraid of dressing down someone if it helped get the job done. As fellow writer James Whitbrook put it, \u201cIf Voyager was a family, Chakotay was the stern dad who\u2019d tell those damn kids like it is.\u201d Star Trek: Enterprise\u000aPlayed by: Jolene Blalock T\u2019Pol was the first Vulcan officer to serve for a long time on a human ship. She served as Sub-Commander for the Vulcan High Command to keep an eye on Captain Jonathan Archer and his crew, because the Vulcan High Command were a bunch of dicks who didn\u2019t think Scott Bacula could steer a ship. She grew to care for them, partially because she was more emotional than the typical Vulcan. The Vulcans kept trying to get her off the ship, but she said no, eventually resigning from High Command to join Starfleet. The character also caused a bit of controversy, mainly regarding her outfits. Her catsuit-like wardrobe was criticised for needlessly over-sexualising the character. The producers denied this early on, but started leaning more heavily on Blalock\u2019s figure as the show\u2019s ratings tanked. T\u2019Pol got more costumes (40 altogether) and her cleavage continually got lower. She also was the subject of Star Trek\u2018s first nude scene, showing her full naked backside, which actually got censored in the US. I\u2019ve got to be honest, I\u2019ve never seen a single episode of Star Trek: Enterprise, so any details I give about the character are second-hand. If you enjoyed T\u2019Pol and want to add something you especially liked about the character, more power to you. But Zachary Q wasnt in the original series...

VGoogle\u2019s Chrome browser is packed full of an incredible amount of extensions that add all sorts of functionality. It\u2019s tough to sift through the store to find what\u2019s useful though, so let us save you some time with this collection of our favorite Chrome extensions.\u000a The Lifehacker Pack is a yearly snapshot of our favourite, must-have applications for our favourite platforms. To download the pack in its entirety, head to our Collection on the Chrome Web Store! Bookmarking services are a great way to save the articles you want to read. For Chrome, you can download an extension to instantly save any article you come across to your service of choice, and they will sync up across all your devices. Which you chose is really up to you, as they\u2019re all great in their own rights. Feedly is the big front-runner for post-Google Reader RSS readers. If it ended up being your choice, then the Feedly extension is a great way to provide yourself instant access to your feeds right inside Chrome. It\u2019s not required anymore, but it\u2019s still good to keep around. If you\u2019re using either Any.Do or Wunderlist for your to-dos, then both of them offer fantastic Chrome extensions that sync across all your devices. This means you\u2019ll never forget what you have to do no matter where you\u2019re working. Wunderlist also now has real-time syncing across devices and shareable to-do lists, while Any.do now makes it easier to manage household or team projects. When it comes to staying on top of your tasks, you can\u2019t go wrong with either of these. If you\u2019re an Evernote user, you should definitely use the Evernote Web Clipper. It lets you save articles, pages, or just sections of a page to your notes so you don\u2019t have copy anything or write anything down. Then you can add your own notes to the things you save, organize everything into specific projects, and more. If you\u2019re a OneNote user, however, Microsoft serves up a web clipper of their own that\u2019s pretty comparable to Evernote\u2019s. There are plenty of web sites out there that want to suck away your time. From social networks to your favourites blogs, it\u2019s easy to lose track of your day. StayFocusd blocks those time-sinking web sites so you can get work done. The web is a chaotic and messy place filled with toolbars, notifications and lots of clutter. If you want to get rid of all that, Minimalist for Everything is an extension that slims down the web to make it simpler to use. Minimalist for Everything can do all kinds of things, from getting rid of Google\u2019s navigation bar to making Gmail less cluttered. Lazarus is a lifesaver for anyone who fills out a lot of forms online, or who writes in their browser. When you\u2019re typing in a form, Lazarus saves what you\u2019re doing. If your browser crashes, Lazarus saves a backup. It\u2019s simple, but it can seriously rescue your day. Gmail\u2019s a great web app, but the problem is that it only works when you\u2019re online. Gmail Offline allows you to continue using Gmail even when you don\u2019t have an internet connection. When you connect again, the emails you compose will get sent off just like they would in a desktop app. Ambient sounds can help you fight off distractions and stay productive. Noisli, a web app that allows you to create your own background noise, is now a Chrome extension that doesn\u2019t take up an extra tab to use anymore. Noisli lets you create your own combination of sounds and will let you set up a timer as a way to track your work. Pushbullet makes it easy to bridge the gap between your desktop and mobile OSes. You can push text, links, files, maps and more from your computer directly to your phone or tablet. You can also push data from your phone to your Chrome browser, and Pushbullet makes use of Chrome\u2019s great notification system. Lastpass is our favourite password manager, because it\u2019s free and easy to set up. With it, you\u2019ll never have to remember a password again, and all your passwords will be synced up across your various devices. The nice thing is that you can do all kinds of cool things with Lastpass, so you\u2019ll never get bored of it.  It should be noted that LastPass was breached by hackers somewhat recently, but no encrypted user data was stolen and we still recommend it. HTTPS is one of the simplest ways to make browsing the web more secure, and HTTPS Everywhere is an extension that makes it so you don\u2019t even have to think about it. With it, you\u2019ll always visit the encrypted, secure version of a site whenever you type in the URL. AdBlock Plus is usually just seen as a tool to block annoying ads on websites, but it\u2019s a lot more than that. It will also protect your privacy across the web, block other sections you want to hide (like YouTube comments), and even block malware. Sure, it\u2019s also an ad blocker, but it\u2019s so much more. If you want a leaner alternative that doesn\u2019t eat up as much memory and potentially slow your system down, uBlock Origin can provide just as much safety and privacy protection as AdBlock Plus. Disconnect\u2019s main purpose is simple: it blocks third-party tracking cookies. This means Disconnect blocks advertisers and social networks from tracking your browsing habits. On top of that, Disconnect has all kinds of tricks up its sleeves, including the ability to block people from hacking into your person info. Even better, Disconnects new privacy icons make it even easier to tell if a site\u2019s legit. SecureGmail is very simple: click on a button, and the email you\u2019re about to send through Gmail is encrypted. The only way to decrypt it is if the recipient has a password. It\u2019s not perfect by any means, but as a quick and simple way to protect your private messages it does the trick. Flix Plus is Lifehacker\u2019s own made-inhouse extension for tweaking Netflix.com. You can filter recommendations, remove spoilers for movies and TV shows, use keyboard shortcuts, view ratings from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB, and so much more. We also make sure Flix Plus stays up to date when Netflix rolls out updates of their own, so you can always have best possible movie-watching experience in a browser. Having a bunch of tabs open in your browser is a resource hog, and if you\u2019re not careful you can slow your system to crawl. The Great Suspender takes care of this problem by automatically suspending tabs you\u2019re not using so they don\u2019t use up CPU. It\u2019s certainly not the only tool to wrangle in your tab usage, but it\u2019s one of the most useful. Region blocking makes it difficult for a lot of people to watch cool videos. The TunnelBear VPN extension lets you route your internet traffic from whatever country you like so you can stream blocked content from anywhere. You get 500MB of free data every month, but there is an unlimited plan for US$4.99/month for any five computers or mobile devices. We no longer recommend Hola Better Internet, after the discovery that they sell your bandwidth to basically run a botnet for hire. If you\u2019re a big Facebook user, then you owe it to yourself to give Social Fixer a try. It\u2019s our pick for the best way to make Facebook better because you can do all kinds of things with it, including getting rid of obnoxious political posts, track people who unfriend you, and plenty more. It\u2019s not as powerful as it used to be, but it\u2019s still a worthwhile extension to keep around. YouTube can be pretty annoying sometimes, but if you want to fix some of the most common problems with it, Magic Actions is the easiest way to do it. You can set up auto-HD, stop autoplay, create a cinema mode and more. So this list is exactly the same as last year, just with a few less options.. I understand that great apps stay great, but how about this list actually be made useful by not repeating itself (add a link to last years instead - or at least make it clear which apps were on last years list), and actually add some reasons that an option was removed. Or, reasons why an option was added (which in this case isn't possible, as nothing new was provided). I have had a look at the "pack for X" lists for 2016 and they too look very similar to their 2015 counterparts.. Hi denno020, Yes, some of the Lifehacker packs feature the same apps, but not all of them. We run it as a series so we can cover all the major operating systems/devices. It's also important to remember new Lifehacker readers may not have seen the packs from the previous year and would find the information useful. Hope this helps! Thank you. Spandas I'm aware that new readers will need to see the whole list, which is why I suggested linking to the previous list, or starting the article off with a "New and noteworthy changes" section, so that long time readers don't have to look through the same list they have for the past 5+ years to see if there is a new gem to try out. to be fair, things like feedly / any do / wunderlist are still the best out there. Chrome used to be decent at one point, for a period of time, but it's really pretty clunky and crap. Firefox is back to being good again, certainly better than Chrome. My fave will always be Seamonkey, makes Chrome and firefox look like baby browsers. You should remove Readability as one of the options for Productivity, since they have announced that the service will stop working at the end of this month (Sept/2016). This information was sent to current users by email and there is an announcement at the top of their homepage. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 4:18 pm								 Can anyone tell me what benefit the Feedly extension has over just using the feedly.com website?

Plus, new footage from Blair Witch, and Supernatural calls in an old friend to fight Hitler. Spoilers get!\u000a Chadwick Boseman discusses the tone of the film with CBR: \u000aIt\u2019s funny, because on one hand, the Marvel movies that I\u2019ve liked the most are the ones that are funny. I love \u201cAnt-Man.\u201d But for me, most of the time the darker superhero movies are the ones that I gravitate towards, that I love the most. So I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m not in an \u201cAnt-Man.\u201d I\u2019m glad that the tone of [\u201cBlack Panther\u201d] may be a little grittier. I just wanted to establish that from the beginning, that that\u2019s what we were doing. That that\u2019s what I intend to do. I feel like we\u2019ll end up in a place that I\u2019ve always wanted to be when I look at superhero movies. Those are the ones I like the most. It\u2019s exciting to do that.\u000a After many delays \u2014 and even Relativity going into bankruptcy \u2014 filming has been confirmed to begin in January 2017. [The Wrap] Joe Quesada tells CBR to expect characters like Ms Marvel to become important parts of their transmedia operations \u2014 including possible TV and Film appearances: \u000aAnother great example of this: Ms. Marvel. If we had put this book out 10 years ago, it probably would never have succeeded. Not only did we find the audience, but we had the right people on the book and we had the right editor on the book, the right creators on the book. And now we have a character that\u2019s very recognisable \u2014 very, very quickly. That doesn\u2019t happen a lot.\u000a\u000aWho knows where Ms. Marvel\u2019s going to end up. You can be sure that, somewhere down the road, she will be a part of the future of Marvel in other media.\u000a J.K. Simmons has wrapped filming. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, he revealed that his scenes are mostly with Batman: \u000aYeah, mostly with Ben. In this first instalment of the Justice League, Commissioner Gordon is not a particularly sizable part. We just kind of introduce him and see a little bit of his interactions with Batman \u2014 and with most of the Justice League. That was a really fun set. Zack [Snyder] runs sort of a big, happy family and it\u2019s obviously, in many ways, a very different work environment when you\u2019re working on a big, giant movie like that than a relatively small movie like The Meddler. But at the end of the day, the director is the one who sets the tone. And one of the things that Zack and Lorene have in common is they\u2019re just nice, smart, competent, fun people that you don\u2019t mind spending a 12-hour day with.\u000a The first clip features Jackie Chan\u2019s Master Wu battling a chicken:  Here are a few new TV spots for the film:   Speaking to fans during a break from filming, Peter Capaldi remarked that the show will return following this year\u2019s Christmas special in April 2017 \u2014 earlier than expected, as the show has been held for the spring months for the last three seasons.

V\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to picking a home to buy, it seems our gadgets are more important to us than our friends and family. Research from Yorkshire Building Society into house buyers\u2019 likes and dislikes shows more people want space for electricals like big screen TVs than to be close to friends and family. Extra room for their prized technology was highlighted by 77% of prospective home buyers as an important factor when looking for a home, compared to just 69% who said distance from family and friends was a key influence. Jemma Anderson, Yorkshire Building Society Mortgage Manager, said: \u201cWe were surprised to see space for electricals was deemed more important than being close to family and friends.\u201d The study, conducted by YouGov among 2,000 people, showed that paying up-front fees (75%) was among the biggest barriers faced by prospective home buyers. The most important reason for moving overall was the amount of living space on offer (93%), closely followed by the number of or size of bedrooms (90%) and type of property (88%).     Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VAfter just a few days of deliberating and organising, Samsung has issued an official local recall for the Galaxy Note7 in Australia, following the announcement of a worldwide halt on sales and a worldwide recall. Owners are being advised to switch off their phones and return them to where they were purchased \u2014 and to use a courtesy temporary replacement provided by Samsung.  Samsung has set up a website devoted to the recall of the 50,000-plus devices sold to Australian customers. Device owners can complete a form to be contacted by Samsung, or can call the company\u2019s customer service phone line on 1300 362 603.   Those courtesy devices will be available from Wednesday 7 September, and will be provided to customers until replacement Galaxy Note7 stock comes into the country in three to four weeks. Alternatively, any customer that doesn\u2019t want to keep their Note7 in light of the recall is being offered a full refund.  Anyone that purchased a Galaxy Note7 through Samsung\u2019s carrier partners \u2014 Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and Virgin Mobile \u2014 will be contacted directly or can contact their telco\u2019s customer service to coordinate a return for the recall. Carriers may offer different remedies to Samsung for their customers, but Samsung says both will be eligible for temporary replacement devices whole waiting for new Note7 deliveries.  In the weeks since launch, Samsung has sold 51,060 Galaxy Note7 smartphones in Australia. No reports of battery incidents have been confirmed in Australia, although the company is investigating \u201ca small number of reported incidents\u201d locally, and a total of 35 incident reports across Korea, the US and Taiwan were made to Samsung from the approximately 2.5 million Note7 devices sold since the mid-August launch.  Samsung is asking Note7 owners not to use their phones any more, to complete a backup and to switch off their devices, and to contact either their carrier or Samsung directly (as appropriate) to arrange the recall. Samsung will cover the courier costs for picking up affected devices and delivering replacement handsets and temporary handsets, and recommends that customers talk to its support staff to complete a data backup that can be transferred between devices.  The issue, as explained by Samsung, is a manufacturing fault in the Note7\u2019s battery \u2014 which is unique to this handset and not used in any other Samsung device: \u201cBased on our investigation, we have learned that there was an issue within the battery cell. An overheating of the battery cell occurred when the anode-to-cathode came into contact which is a very rare manufacturing process error.\u201d  Here\u2019s the official statement from Samsung:  Samsung Electronics Australia is today taking the proactive and voluntary step to recall 51,060 Galaxy Note7 smartphones. The recall is in response to the recent announcement by Samsung Consumer Electronics global regarding isolated battery cell issues with the Galaxy Note7 device. Samsung Electronics Australia advises all customers who use a Galaxy Note7 smartphone to power off their device, return it to its place of purchase and use an alternative device until a remedy can be provided. Customers who have purchased a Galaxy Note7 from Samsung are entitled to a new Galaxy Note7 (and a courtesy device until replacement Galaxy Note7 stock arrives) or a full refund. The delivery of a replacement Galaxy Note 7 to customers is expected within three to four weeks. Alternatively, customers who have not purchased a Galaxy Note7 from Samsung can approach their place of purchase to discuss their remedy options. \u201cThe safety and ongoing satisfaction of our customers is our top priority,\u201d said Richard Fink, Vice President IT & Mobile, Samsung Electronics Australia. \u201cWe know our Galaxy Note7 customers are our most loyal customers and we are taking a proactive approach to support them. We are asking customers to contact Samsung or their place of purchase to arrange a suitable courtesy smartphone or refund. \u201cCourtesy devices will become available from this Wednesday (September 7, 2016).\u201d Galaxy Note7 smartphone owners can visit the place of purchase of their device or call Samsung Customer Service on 1300 362 603 or visit http://www.samsung.com/au/galaxynote7-notice/. Love my 6S PLus, looking forward to Sept 7. Sit on and laugh at 4 out of 15 S7s in our office that have shit them selves since new (firmware issues, freezing, rebooting and one complete failure). This is why Android will never be better, just a good competitor. iPhone 7 might just be the worst selling iPhone of all time. And despite the recall, the Note 7 might be the best selling Note of all time. I guess time will tell. Also I know plenty of people with s7's and not one of them has shit itself. IOS is a better operating system in a lot of ways, but having dropped my 6 Plus in favour of an S7 I can tell you for sure the Samsung hardware is much better! And that's a fact. you are dreaming mate... they sold 50,000 note 7's in aus since launch and just over a million word wide. The iPhone 7 will crack those numbers in the first day. do you want to run the figures on android phones versus phones running ios in terms of sales figures? note 7s are just one of many android flagship phones, not all android users are going to fork out for a $1200, because they dont have to. there are cheaper, just as functional options around. so its not really and apples to apples comparison. when all apple users literally have 3 choices for the next gen of phone starting at $600ish and above.\u000abut the amount of people i work with in a corporate setting that just get iphones because they are expensive and seen as an up market item, they just buy them blindly. although that has lessened over the last few years becasue people are catching on that apple really are just smoke and mirrors now days compared to the other phones on offer. Wow get back on de meds man... first of all the poster was talking about the galaxy range not everything on the planet including fridges and TV's running Android, try and stay in context show me a single android phone that outsells the iPhone today. Im not talking about the millions of cheap crap that gets pumped into India and china. Flagships. Secondly your statement of enterprise is ridiculous. The main reasons iPhones are 85% in fortune 500 companies is, security, stability and usability. You do know that simply saying something doesn't make it true right? but thats why i made the point. the fact that there are so many android phones of varying price points, you will never get a single android phone that out sells another brand that offers 3 choices. thats why if you are going to do sales comparisons, it needs to be beteen OS's and not specific devices. But how would I compare and iPhone to a smart TV, or the latest fridges? How will it compare against all devices that run android. If Apple was not interested in making money they too could bring out a sub $200 phone and open the OS to run on anything. Im sorry but to find the best phone you have to match phone models.  For the sake of the argument ill say that Android use far outstrips that of iOS BUT what is the best phone? i suppose the best phone is decided by the user in the end and what fits their needs. which really does make arguing back and forth about apple and samsung quite pointless The Fortune 500 is an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks 500 of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue for their respective fiscal years in this list below which is world wide. Samsung is rated 6th, Apple is 12th. im not sure its really a fair comparison though for a number of reasons.\u000ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue I think the dude was trying to say that 85% of fortune 500 companies give their employees  apple phones as work phones. Not sure where he got his facts from, but it could be true. Based on revenue Samsung would be higher because they sell way more products than apple but I think apple would have a higher profit due to cheaper production costs and their optimistic tax returns... \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 2:45 pm								 At what point did this turn into a discussion about fridges? Skinja is talking about phones you're the one who mentioned fridges and TVs. Skinja has got a point. Apple has only a few models to choose from so naturally *every* apple fan is going to be interested in just a few different handsets. Android has probably several hundred companies making phones with thousands of different models at different price points and feature sets. edit: found this article it really highlights the issue. If you read it you'll see that they talk about iphone 6 sales being about 75 million for the quarter and talk about how S7 was only about 10 million. However, it also mentions *total* Samsung sales over all phone models for the quarter are about 82 million. Which really highlights the fact that people like choice. http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/07/16/editorial-sorry-android-bloggers-but-samsungs-galaxy-s7-didnt-outsell-apples-iphone-6s It's not really a fair comparison unless Apple licenses production and you start seeing a Samsung or Sony manufactured smartphone. Of course that will never happen. As for whether iPhone is better in enterprise, it's not. However, the decision to use it is often pushed onto IT teams by management (it was where I worked). Security, stability and usability isn't what's winning the fight, it's style and desirability.  Oh and note7 has already sold 2.5million not 1 million (it's in the article itself). \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 3:24 pm								 And about 50% of fruit phones i see have cracked screens. It's a shame people get suckered in to paying so much for an inferior product. First Aussie one to blow up.\u000aMore expected.\u000aJust get an iPhone.

Compared to 3 year old phones it is average, compared to modern android phones it is a joke. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 8:37 am								 Wow, you really have your head in the sand!! The year old 6s scorches the note 7 in benchmark and real world tests.  Better get your facts right before posting. Makes you look a little like a fandroid.  http://bgr.com/2016/08/26/iphone-7-vs-note-7-performance-tests-power/ "The test wasn\u2019t scientific by any means" A quote from your article. I'll take facts and figures thanks!  Gaming on an apple phone's 720p screen will of course be faster than the samsung which has 4 times the amount of pixels. It's like comparing a high end gaming PC on 4k resolution with a budget laptop running a HD ready screen. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 10:23 am								 LOL Not scientific, just real world. You're in complete denial. You won't want to see the geekbench tests when the iPhone 7 comes out, you'll need some tissues. At least you can grill a ham & cheese sandwich with your Samsung Note 7, I guess that's what you call multitasking. Apple are great at making simple phones that do simple tasks fast. That's fine for most people, hence why they sell well. I like the customisation of android, sure it might be slower opening 8 apps in a row just to close them, but that's not how I use my phone. I also like my QHD screen, I have an S7 Edge and that display is amazing. Light years ahead of apple. Hasn't exploded yet thankfully! No jo, its called innovation :) Yawn... the starting line for every fandroid commenter on the interwebs... Neither of Sumsungs flagships out sell the iPhone. The reason for that is evident in real world the iPhone is faster and more stable. Android phones need desktop specs to run as smoothly. In a world of climate change and the car industry samsung is like a Holden 6.2 V8 petrol guzzling monster engine and the iPhones is the 2.5L v5 German engineered car that just smoked the holden around the track and down the straight Samsung sells more phones than apple. Android is more popular than ios. Great metaphor, sums up android vs ios perfectly, people will always prefer a screaming V8 to a boring family hatch. oh dear... last para sums you up mate Thanks! You must know a lot of clumsy people. Yeah I don't get the whole iSheep craze. The guy above claims he will buy this new one when he already has last year's one, from what I have read there are only minor improvements and a major flaw in that the headphone socket will be removed! He could potentially be paying $1100+ for a worse phone! I'll be upgrading from iPhone 6 to 7 plus. Main reason is because my contract is up and time to hand this phone to the missus and get the new shiny for myself. I work in an industrial environment. My phone has no case nor screen protector and is still in pristine condition. No cracked screen, nothing.  I'm also glad to see the end of the headphone jack. Never once in my 3 iphones' life have I ever had to charge and listen to something at once. My favourite earphones of all time are the ear pods, so lightning ear pods sounds fucking great to me. You Droid's are so touchy since this recall. Hit a nerve did it? Personally, I don't give a shit. I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 for my workphone in one pocket and my Personal iPhone in my other. Both good phones, I just prefer the apple ecosystem at home as everything I own is multiple mac's, ipads, ipods and iphones. And it all just.....works. Whatever blows your hair back man..... I don't care about the recall either, I have an S7 Edge so I'm kind of glad the Note 7 is a flop as it means I still have the best Samsung phone ever made!  My last phones were windows and apple phones, they all have pros and cons it's just about which one you like more. Its just one issue that they are getting on top of, it's still a better phone than the s7 edge, I went in to Optus with the option of choosing a different handset but after a week with the note 7 nothing else came close so I'll happily wait a few weeks for a new one. Seriously, dude, this has got nothing to do with Android. It is not an OS problem at all. It is a rare but serious hardware defect in the manufacturing process of the batteries, which are new for this model. Batteries which, by the way, are manufactured by Samsung, the same company that is also one of the main manufacturers of batteries for your beloved iPhone 6S: because you do know, don't you, that Apple makes none of its own hardware components, nor does it assemble the final product? The components are made by some 200 suppliers around the world and are assembled by two companies based in Taiwan but with actual operations in China: the Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (trading as Foxconn) and Pegatron.

Oh look, we found *that* guy. Not wanting to get into the whole debate but different opinions/perspectives. Glad you like what you have though buddy! On topic - Like others have mentioned, I'm impressed at the speed at which Samsung got into gear and has proactively communicated with customers and their partners who have/are cascading the message.\u000aE.g. I also purchased the new Samsung Gear VR - (which is a bit of a gimmick but hey, fun) and I received an Email from Oculus advising me of the Samsung Note7 issue with the same consistent messaging (return your phone, safety is #1 etc.) I still haven't heard anything from Optus so I guess I'll initiate contact tomorrow and find out what the temporary replacement device is. Personally, I really have enjoyed owning the Note7 and will be opting for a replacement Note7. As a consumer, I'm (very slightly) miffed at the inconvenience but I'd also rather not have my phone explode on the bedside table while I'm sleeping. I'm actually not impressed by the speed with which I've been communicated with. I still haven't received a notification from Vodafone (since they're who I bought the phone from). If this is considered a major problem (as it obviously is) then why the hell didn't they do a DB search to identify all their users with Note7s and do a mass SMS? Samsung may have been proactive (and good on them) but the telcos are dragging their feet a bit. Optus are straight onto it. Have my loan phone already. Got to say not loving the j1 mini. I dont remember 4" screens being this small. Still haven't heard anything from Optus but I'll get on to them tomorrow.\u000aJ1 Mini? Really?   :S I didnt hear from optus got an email from samsung this morning. But optus girl was all over it got the loan phone sorted in no time. You can just change contract for another phone but none seemed as nice after a couple of weeks with the n7 Makes you wonder what they'll do with a million j1 phones after the note7s are fixed. If youve ever worked in telco sales youd know that retail stores can never have enough loan phone stock. Id say samsung will either get them back and refurb or the stores will hold on to them Interestingly, on Telstra's Note7 replacement page - it says that J1's *don't* need to be returned.  https://crowdsupport.telstra.com.au/t5/Announcements/Samsung-Galaxy-Note7-Information-about-the-battery-issue/ba-p/604229 Went to Vodafone today and they said it's going to be an S7 as a loaner not a J1 Mini. Makes me feel a lot better of giving up the new phone for 4-6 weeks. That's good. I'm with Optus and J1 was the only option on offer. :/ Accepted it because I don't want to be Australian Note7 incident #3 but have contacted both Samsung and the Optus complaints team to say that a J1 just isn't an acceptable option for me. (I'd be OK with that if it were a few days - but not several weeks...) As an aside, still have not heard from Optus proactively - I had to venture into one of their stores. Well that was amusing went to vodafone to ask about it and had to give up after waiting without seeing anyone. Got home and the phone pings with a msg from samsung and a few minutes later an sms from vodafone about the recall. For the Apple worshippers this has got to be the best thing since sliced bread. If this is because Samsung were pushing too hard to release this product before the iP7 then it has really bitten them hard.\u000aI don't own a Samsung or Apple but I am pretty impressed how Samsung have handled this knowing how damaging it is to their reputation. Remember how long the catching fire hover boards went on before anything was done, at least they've been very proactive to stop any potential fires even though the percentage of devices with the issue is absolutely bugger all (at this stage anyway). \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 8:32 am								 Apple phones explode too!  http://www.smh.com.au/technology/mobiles/sydney-bike-rider-gareth-clear-left-with-thirddegree-burns-after-iphone-exploded-20160801-gqirdx.html And they also had a problem affecting the last decade's worth of chargers! http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/computers/apple-recalls-more-than-a-decade-of-macbook-ipad-power-adapters-due-to-risk-of-electric-shock-20160128-gmgkkw.html Yes I remember some of those Apple incidents, and some Tesla's have burned to the ground too when charging, the 'joys' of Lithium batteries. Be careful note 7 users.  Detailed report from the first one to explode in Australia.  Using official Samsung charger.  Had never been hot before.  Exploded on bed with nothing covering it.  Reports from Taiwan today one exploded while not on charge.  Ticking time bombs.  Take them back and get an iPhone.  https://m.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNote7/comments/518ncu/my_note_7_exploded_first_case_in_australia/ id rather take a $150 loan phone then buy an iphone. especially seeing im invested in android already. and i work with and help fix peoples issues with iphones at my work. i see more iphones with issues then i do with android phones. You don't even have to take a $150 load phone if you're with Telstra: https://crowdsupport.telstra.com.au/t5/Announcements/Samsung-Galaxy-Note7-Information-about-the-battery-issue/ba-p/604229 Dazzler, you are grasping at straws, that dude fell of his bike at speed and landed directly on the phone, its wasn't sitting gently on table when it exploded.  Your efforts are admirable but this was a total samsung fail a week before a new iPhone release. If this was apple you would be the first on here gloating and spit, so take as good as you give I say. You are right it was a total fail! I would not be surprised if it sets samsung back considerably. I don't care overly, I just find it funny when people are on here saying that apple are better than samsung because of this recall, yet they forget that last year apple recalled a decade's worth of chargers for safety reasons. http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/computers/apple-recalls-more-than-a-decade-of-macbook-ipad-power-adapters-due-to-risk-of-electric-shock-20160128-gmgkkw.html \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 10:38 am								 Apple phones explode too! There is a difference between a battery being punctured during an accident and a phone exploding under normal operation. You know that. Everybody knows that. Apple only make flagship phones, if you combine the note 7 and S7 sales it won't come close to the iphone. Are you capable of seeing the bigger picture? Android is popular because its free and the devices they are loaded onto are cheap, which equates to large numbers sold to third world countries. Yes there are more devices with Android on the market but to establish what the best phone is you need to break down the numbers. Show me a single phone model that outsell the iPhone. You can't the single best selling phone is the iPhone, this makes it king of the hill. At the end of the day, if this had been an iPhone, Apple would have just warned their customers not to charge it at any time it could cause a fire. Just like they told their customers not to hold the phone wrong. Samsung is showing their integrity by doing a voluntary recall. Errrr no dude. In what world do you think Samsung are "voluntarily" doing this to be nice. The stories you people put on business decisions are confounding. They're recalling because an alarming number have blown up already, this early into the phone's cycle, and someone will eventually get hurt leading to a possibly insurmountably expensive class action lawsuit.  Get your head out of your ass. Wow. People really do get all het up in their Android vs Apple feelings, scratching around to find stats and opinions to back up their view that one platform is "better" than the other.\u000aI hadn't realised their was quite so much fandom!\u000aI own both platforms (and a Windows phone for good measure). They've each got their pros and cons. If I was moderating this comments box, all apple vs samsung comments would be deleted. I left my details to have samsung call me (on a different phone to my Note 7) but haven't received a call as yet. I tried to call them today but got "all operators are busy please call back later". I have been using my phone fine since the recall announcement last week, no issues at all.  I wonder what the courtesy device is? I'll complete a backup tonight and stop using it... i guess  but i'm not happy about it. The whole process is going to be a huge hassle. I'll have to co-ordinate leaving the phone with my parents, I'll have to get some bubble wrap for it, and then i'll have to wait a month for a new phone to come back. Geez, again with the p1ssing contest of Andriod vs. Apple.  Use WTF you're happy with and be done with it.\u000aNews flash: All platforms/manufactures have strengths, weaknesses, features, flaws, pro's and con's. Kudo's to Sumsumg for being proactive and diligent in light of this; I'm saying this as an iOS user. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 1:34 pm								 I (so very naively) thought people would be past this: It's just a bloody phone, hey? Does it work for you? Do you use it effectively? Hoorah! Who gives a crap what other people use. Agreed. Well done Samsung for owning the issue and implementing a quick resolution. In a perfect world this never would have happened however many other OEM's have had similar issues and have tried to sweep them under the rug and pretend they never existed.   Those iPhone and Android fanboys that are battling it out in the comments, Yes iPhone is the single highest selling device on the market however this doesn't make it any better or worse than any other phone. The iPhone by itself in terms of pure specifications is not a great device and i'm sure that if Apple ever licences the iOS operating system to other OEM there would soon be many cheaper and better spec iOS phones available and the iPhone itself would lose a lot of market share. Same thing would be true if Samsung was the sole Android OEM, they would control the market and would probably have the highest selling devices. Its nice to see Samsung, Telstra and Optus doing the right thing by customers... I took my note 7 into Vodafone Brisbane Mall store today and was told to hang onto and keep using it for a few more weeks while they work out a recall plan. What if it explodes in my face tonight? \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 2:17 pm								 It only explodes while charging... so don't use it while charging? The thing charges so quickly, surely you can put it down for half an hour. There is mention above of Note 7 exploding during normal use, not necessarily while charging. As i type this on my Note 7 about 12 inches from my face i feel less safe than i did a week ago. But my point is that there appears to be a genuine safety risk. Has appeared that way since last week. So why are Vodafone beating around the bush? Samsung, Telstra and Optus have demonstrated that they genuinely care for customers safety. When i left the Vodafone store today with my Note7, i got the impression they were more worried about running out of J1 Mini stock than my safety. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 3:03 pm								 Definitely go back to a vodafone store (maybe a different store) and ask to speak to the manager if the next person tells you the same thing. You can't go on the word of just one person with these things. If they continue to play funny buggers, go to the TIO. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 4:01 pm								 Vodafone just posted a recall plan. They haven't passed on the same or as many options (no J1 Mini option!) as Samsung said all the telcos would (and the others have), but at least it sounds like they'll accept returns at any store  :) http://vodafone.intelliresponse.com/index.jsp?requestType=NormalRequest&source=100&id=2733&question=Samsung+Galaxy+Note+7+Recall \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 4:32 pm								 Is Apple v Android/Samsung the new Godwin law is it?  This issue could of happened with any device, who cares what brand it was at the end of the day it is a very bad thing and we are lucky so far no one has been seriously hurt by the incidents. To those fanboying over Apple VS Samsung. They are just god damn phones. Get the fuck over it. Grow up, Stop arguing like petty toddlers over a chunk of metal and plastic. You are a bunch of petulant children. Iphones bending, samsung exploding. I am going to hold off for a while.\u000aI will continue to use my older trusted devices It is a shame that every discussion on phones ends up as Android vs Apple.  Neither side will admit the merits of the opposite's devices.  Sadly, I have to use both devices and my personal preference is Android (Samsung particularly), however my professional choice (special ed teacher) is an Apple device.  There are pros and cons for each device/company for each thing.  Having said this, I really respect Samsung for doing such a large recall.  It would be costing them millions of dollars around the world and they are willing to do it to protect people (and yes, in turn, themselves)...but it is really becoming rare for a company to bother with end users to this degree.

VA good mechanical keyboard can be fun for work or play, but finding one that delivers everywhere you need it to can be a bit of a challenge. Das Keyboard\u2019s newly launched Prime 13 is a well-built stunner, and ticks off a lot of the personal boxes I look for in a mechanical that can pull double duty.\u000a For the uninitiated, mechanical keyboards \u2014 or keyboards with full, individual switches under each key \u2014 may not be for everyone, but the community around them is healthy and growing, largely because they\u2019re just so fun to use, and introduce a geeky, customisation and personalisation element to a tool you likely use every single day. The Das Prime 13 may have just launched, but the company sent me one to play with a few weeks ago, and I\u2019m using it to write this piece, in an open office with other people sitting around me \u2014 and even after asking to make sure, they\u2019re not bothered in the slightest. The Prime 13 isn\u2019t the quietest mechanical I\u2019ve used (the Cooler Master Novatouch takes that prize) but its Cherry MX Brown switches do mean it\u2019s a bit softer than other keyboards I\u2019ve used. It\u2019s a full-sized keyboard (which I also like, although I know many people prefer tenkeyless models) with a USB port at the top that\u2019s perfect for a wireless mouse receiver or other USB device. A 1.98m braided USB cable means you have plenty of room to plug it in to the back of your PC or into a laptop on the other side of your desk. It also sports white LED backlighting, perfect for working long hours, or, if you\u2019re like me, just a little form with your function. The aluminium top-panel is remniscent of the pricier Das Keyboard 4, in a more affordable package. Speaking of price, the Prime 13 is $US149 ($194) retail, though we\u2019re looking at importing it until it becomes locally available. There are definitely cheaper, more accessible mechanicals out there, to be sure. One of the reasons the Prime 13 hits the sweet spot for me though is that I have a shortlist of things I need in a mechanical I\u2019m going to use for work: It needs to be full-size with a numpad, it needs to be backlit, and it needs a USB hub of some kind in it. I can give or take on things like dedicated or function-toggled media keys or the kind of backlighting or how many USB ports, but I definitely need that much \u2014 and the Prime 13 hits all of those points. It\u2019d be nicer if it were closer to the $US100 ($130) point, but I imagine we we see more retailers pick this up and sell it, we\u2019ll see some price competition. In the interim, if you\u2019re looking for a premium mechanical at a midrange price with solid build quality, the Prime 13 is worth a look. Das Keyboard

p268
V There are an endless number of hiccup cures out there, and many of them involve drinking something. This doctor recommended method shows, however, that it\u2019s not really what you drink, but how you drink it that\u2019s important.\u000a\u000aIn this video from the Business Insider YouTube channel, Dr Erich Voigt, an otolaryngologist at New York University, shares a simple way to cure the hiccups that has always worked for his patients. Just fill a cup with water and drink from the opposite side of the cup that your normally drink from. So not the \u201cthumb side\u201d, the \u201cfinger side\u201d. You\u2019ll have to tilt your head pretty far forward to do this, but it will force your abdomen muscles to contract and stop your hiccups. This method is in accordance with one of the two mechanisms that make hiccup cures work \u2014 the other being methods that involve your breathing and CO2 in the blood. Voigt says this cure even worked on a patient who had the hiccups for two weeks straight. The cure for hiccups that works every, single time [YouTube] tried that but it never worked for me.  but my go to solution was always to drink a mouthful of orange juice and it cures them instantly for me Nope doesn't work for me, nothing seems to work.  Al I can do is ride 'em out.  Although, I do think, not thinking about them helps! \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 3:10 pm								 I can never properly explain it, but I cure hiccups by burping partway through the hiccup. As I understand em, hiccups are a different in air pressure, or something like that, and by rolling the hic- part into a burp, it seems to get rid of the cycle that annoys us all. Works for me anyway. I normally use the other of the two methods - drinking 6 sips of water without breathing.

VThree quarters of us support Government\u2019s plan for 10Mbps service obligation At the end of last year the Government proposed to consult on a new legally-binding Universal Service Obligation (USO), which will ensure everyone in the UK can access a minimum broadband speed of 10 Megabits per second (10Mbps). Ofcom\u2019s existing USO only requires that the primary telecoms operator (BT for the UK and KC in Hull) should deliver, following the \u201creasonable request of any end-user\u201d, a telephone service that includes the ability to offer \u201cdata rates that are sufficient to permit functional internet access\u201d (i.e. conceivably dialup class Internet services at 28.8Kbps+). An online survey conducted by broadband comparison website ISPreview.co.uk, which questioned 1,823 UK Internet users about the proposed policy, found that three quarters (77%) of respondents support the Government\u2019s plan for a 10Mbps USO and most would even be willing to pay a bit extra for it. Would you still support the USO if it meant a small rise in broadband price (e.g. 50p a month), asked the survey? Yes \u2013 50p is fine \u2013 61.6%\u000aNo \u2013 24%\u000aYes \u2013 If less than 50p \u2013 9.3%\u000aUnsure \u2013 4.9% Despite all this, some 75% of respondents also felt that the USO should deliver a faster speed than 10Mbps (i.e. only 25% would be completely happy with 10Mbps). Separately just 32% said they would be happy if the USO ended up including Satellite broadband as an approved method of connectivity (i.e. 53% didn\u2019t want Satellite to be included on the USO and 15% were simply unsure). \u201cImposing a legal requirement to deliver a decent level of broadband connectivity is no simple measure and would put additional pressures upon BT, and possibly other operators, in order to meet the requirement,\u201d says ISPreview.co.uk\u2018s Founder, Mark Jackson. \u201cNevertheless the vast majority of respondents clearly support the move and many would even be willing to stomach a small increase in price in order to cater for it.\u201d \u201cHowever consumers clearly want a good quality connection, perhaps ideally a fixed line service, which may explain why only 31% would support the 10Mbps USO if the Government attempted to use a quick-fix solution like Satellite to deliver it. Satellite has already been used for the non-binding 2Mbps Universal Service Commitment (USC), but it can\u2019t deliver a low latency service and struggles to match the affordable IPTV / video streaming friendly \u2018unlimited\u2019 usage allowances of superior methods,\u201d concludes Jackson.   Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VThe Panasonic CF20: A rugged notebook intended for outdoor use Last night saw the UK launch of the latest Panasonic Toughbook at the Shangri-La Hotel on the 34th floor of London\u2019s iconic Shard skyscraper. I went along for the great views over the city of course (it was a beautifully clear evening), but also to get my grubby mitts on what the company bills as the world\u2019s first fully rugged detachable notebook, the Panasonic Toughbook CF-20. First impressions are very favourable. Although it\u2019s unlikely to survive being dropped off the 34th floor (in fact it would probably kill someone if it landed on them from this height), it\u2019s perfect for many companies who need computing power out in the field. Everyone in fact from car breakdown services such as the AA and RAC to railway workers on the tracks to those working for water utility companies \u2013 though it\u2019s water resistant rather than completely waterproof so don\u2019t go dropping it in reservoirs and hoping it will survive! Featuring a 10.1inch WUXGA (1920x 1200 pixels) touchscreen and running Microsoft Windows 10 Pro with Intel Core Processor (4Mb cache, 1.1GHz up to 2.8GHz with Intel Turbo Boost), the new Toughbook can be used in various configurations and is even suitable for workers who need to operate touchscreens wearing gloves. Using the built-in handle, the device can operate hanging on a wall, on the arm or while being carried. It can also operate as a regular notebook or in presentation mode. The only thing we struggled with is getting the stylus pen out of a slot on the side of the device! Panasonic CF20: The handle makes it very easy for carrying around. To ensure up to 14 hours of use there\u2019s a battery powering the tablet and another optional battery that can be inserted into the keyboard to double the capacity. What\u2019s more, the batteries can be also be swapped over while in operation without losing what you are working on. Tipping the scales at 1.76Kg in notebook mode (the detachable tablet weighs 950g), it\u2019s not exactly the lightest device around, but then it\u2019s not meant to be. The CF20 will be available in January with a price tag of £2218 + VAT (with three year warranty). In the YouTube video below, Paul Davidson, Panasonic Toughbook\u2019s Corporate Sales Manager, talks about the features of the world\u2019s first fully rugged detachable notebook. Apologies about the sound \u2013 it was quite noisy with several launches going on at The Shard last night!

VFighting off the freshman fifteen doesn\u2019t mean your choices are limited to treadmills and weights. University fitness centres are filled with surprising, fun amenities to help you get in shape, develop healthy habits, and even de-stress before a big exam. Best of all, for many students it\u2019s all free or heavily discounted.\u000a\u000aIllustration by Sam Woolley. Keep in mind, there are over 43 accredited universities in Australia, and no two schools are exactly alike. That means you probably won\u2019t find everything mentioned here at your school. That said, you\u2019ll never know until you go investigate yourself. Call your fitness centre\u2019s front desk, check their web site, look for billboards or postings at the fitness centre or better yet, ask someone who works in the admissions office. They know all. For many schools, the university fitness centre is \u201cfree\u201d for students, but let\u2019s be honest: You\u2019re paying with your tuition dollars, whether you use it or not. So use it!  University sports give you the opportunity to compete against fellow students in a wide variety of sports for fun. Most of the time they\u2019re organised through the university\u2019s fitness centre with signups going all school year, and it\u2019s often free for students (though some schools require you to pay for a fitness pass). The types of intramural sports vary at each university, but you can expect games like basketball, rugby, volleyball, soccer, handball, tennis, golf, softball, ultimate frisbee, and even dodgeball. If you\u2019re interested in competing against students from other schools, look into joining a club sport team. These types of teams are generally more serious than intramural teams and usually require attending regular practice. It\u2019s like being on a division college sports team, but there are no scholarships or televised tournaments. If your schedule is packed and you don\u2019t have time to join a club or play university games, most fitness centres will let you check out equipment for free so you can do your own thing. Get your friends together for a pickup game of basketball, borrow some rackets and play a few matches of racquetball, or check out some paddles to play some table tennis. Even if you don\u2019t have a group of friends, other students in the same position as you will be hanging around looking for pickup games. And you can always shoot hoops on your own, or rent a racquetball court and kick a soccer ball against the wall. If you want to build some strength but you want something more dynamic than straight weight training, rock climbing might be for you. Universities all over the country have rock walls, and more keep adding them to their fitness centres. There\u2019s one at the University of Sydney in New South Wales. The University of Western Australia also has rock climbing facilities. Almost every university fitness center has a swimming pool of some kind, and some even have Olympic-sized versions. If the gym is crazy busy and there are no open treadmills or lifting machines, Grant Hackton, a former college fitness trainer, suggests swimming can give you a full-body workout when you don\u2019t have time to wait. Swimming is also a great exercise format for people who have injuries, chronic joint or muscular conditions, and different body types where it might be hard to jump right into running or lifting. Keep a swimsuit in your gym bag so you\u2019ll always be ready. You can have a lot of fun when you\u2019re at university but it can also be the most stressful time in your life. If you need to unwind a little before a big final exam, see if your school\u2019s fitness center can hook you up. Some schools have saunas, hot tubs, and even massage centres that are free or severely discounted for students. You can also do some brain maintenance in a dedicated meditation room. When it comes to extracurricular activities, university fitness centres are a goldmine. Most facilities host group classes, offer personal training sessions, like the one at Macquarie University. Classes vary by school and time of year and many university fitness centres offer non-fitness related classes as well, like CPR training. If you\u2019re craving adventure, many universities organise outdoor recreation trips through their fitness or wellness centres. Be sure you check with your fitness center so you know what trips or activities might be coming up soon.

VTelsa\u2019s boss Elon Musk believes that within two years a car will be able to drive across the US completely autonomously It is an open secret according to the South African born entrepreneur Elon Musk that Apple is working on its own car. According to Musk, the boss of Tesla, Apple has hired over 1000 engineers to work on what is presumably an all electric autonomous vehicle. Separately the iPhone manufacturer has also registered several car related domain names, including apple.car and apple.auto. Not that any of this is putting Elon Musk of his latest venture \u2013 a self-driving Tesla. In many ways the only real global tech entrepreneur we have since Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs departed this earth, Musk is nothing if not ambitious. As well as his loss making electric car business, there\u2019s also his rocket company Space X and energy supplier SolarCity, both of which he has sunk millions of dollars into. And at a time when most of us are still trying to get our heads around the benefits of owning an electric car over a traditional petrol driven motor, Musk is the man pushing forward with greater in car autonomy. \u201cThe two biggest revolutions are in electrification and autonomy,\u201d Musk told the BBC\u2019s Rory Cellan Jones on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. \u201cIn the long term no one will buy a car unless it is autonomous,\u201d he boldy claimed. Controversially for many petrol heads he believes that owning a non-autonomous car will be much like owning a horse \u2013 something you have for \u2018sentimental reasons\u2019 rather than for practicality. Tesla is going some way towards autonomy with its Autopilot features which provide a degree of automation in its electric vehicles \u2013 though frankly not really that much more than other manufacturers are already offering on their petrol cars. Included are the ability to keep the car in lane, adjust speed as other cars cut in as well as change lane without the driver needing to intervene. However the latest \u2018beta\u2019 feature to be tested is a \u2018Summon\u2019 facility which will \u2013 if you are on private property \u2013 also allow the car to come and find you even from within a locked garage! Nor will autonomous technology end there, adds Musk. He believes that within two years cars could be driving from one side of the US to the other without any kind of human intervention whatsoever. \u201cThis is the first baby step \u2013 ultimately you\u2019ll be able to summon the car from New York if you\u2019re living in LA, and it will drive across the country, charge itself at the various locations and come to you,\u201d he told the BBC. It may take the fun out of driving, but for many people it will take the headache out too.

VSometimes, all a man has in this world is his name, but according to Intel, antivirus pioneer and living cautionary tale John McAfee doesn\u2019t even have that.\u000a Back in May, MGT Capital Investments announced that McAfee was joining the company as Chief Financial Officer, briefly sending MGT stock skyrocketing from 36 cents ($0.48) to $US5.38 ($7) a share. Shortly afterward, the company revealed it was in the process of acquiring D-Vasive, \u201ca provider of leading edge anti-spy software\u201d and intended to change its name to \u201cJohn McAfee Global Technologies, Inc.\u201d According to recently filed court documents, however, Intel threatened to take legal action in June after learning of the planned name change \u2014 an alleged infringement of the \u201cMcAfee\u201d trademark owned by Intel. McAfee, of course, was the founder of the antivirus company that Intel acquired the trademark from, but Intel claims he \u201cforfeited any right to use the McAfee name in connection with security solutions and services\u201d when he sold his assets to the company in 1991. Now, it looks the matter will be determined in court: On Friday, McAfee and MGT filed a lawsuit against Intel, including an \u201cAsset Acquisition Agreement\u201d from 1991 they say proves he, if nothing else, still owns his name.

VEven a frequent flier with elite status has a hard time nabbing an upgrade to first class these days. If you want to increase your odds, you need to know when you should fly.\u000a\u000aPhoto by Gary Bembridge. As Gary Leff, founder of the View from the Wing blog, explains to Eric Rosen at Bloomberg, the chances of getting a seat upgrade are smaller than ever before. And it\u2019s all because some things have changed while others haven\u2019t. The number of elite flyers is on the rise and major airline mergers have concentrated elite status flyers into fewer programs, but the number of premium aeroplane seats has remained unchanged for the most part. That means more people to trying to fill the same number of seats. Whether you have elite flyer status, you\u2019re an airline credit card holder or you paid full fare prices for your ticket (another way to boost your chances of an upgrade), you can help your odds by flying when business travellers don\u2019t usually fly. Avoid early flights on Monday mornings, or Thursday and Friday afternoon flights between 5:00 and 7:30PM. The best times, according to Leff, are the middle of the day on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. And if you fly during holidays, there will be a lot of people, but fewer business travellers. So a holiday flight might increase your chances to upgrade as well. How to Get a First Class Upgrade Every Time [Bloomberg Pursuits]

VThe number one function of a shot glass is to hold alcohol so you can get it into your mouth. Toasted marshmallow shot glasses sure look cute, but if they disintegrate en route to my lips, I will be less than amused. To see if any of these twee-arse vessels are worth your time, we made a whole bunch and tested them for leakiness, flavour contribution, and ease of assembly. We\u2019ll start with the best and work our way down to the failures.  These little guys come from the blog Through the Eyes of my Belly, and I was fully expecting them to fail. Luckily, they did not, and beat out all others for the number one spot. Instead of constructing molds out of paper towel tubes and foil (as they instructed), I just wrapped the bacon around the glass, securing it with a bit of kitchen twine. I then popped them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes, keeping a very close eye on them at all times. It was kind of a smokey process, but they crisped up just fine into cute little meat cups, and slid off the shot glasses with ease. I then coated the insides with tempered chocolate, and let them set until the chocolate hardened. Then, it was the moment of truth, so I filled those suckers up with a little cherry-infused bourbon to test. Let\u2019s see how they did: If you like bacon, chocolate, and bourbon, you will like these. In short, they are totally worth your time. These treats come to us from the stunt food blog Oh, Bite It! and come in second simply because I had to modify them to make them fully functional. (We\u2019ll get to the mod in a moment.) To make them, I cut a Pillsbury cinnamon roll in half, shoved it down in a shot glass that was treated with a little cooking spray, and baked them at 350 degrees until they puffed up and browned on the top. Then, while they were still warm, I pushed the neck of a mini liquor bottle down into the dough to create a place for the booze to live. Once they were cool, they wiggled right out. Now, at this point, Oh, Bite It! instructs us to dip the rims into icing and throw some Bailey\u2019s in there. You could do that, but you\u2019d have to shoot that Bailey\u2019s quite quickly, as the liquid soaks through the dough, making your glass soggy and soft. I do not enjoy a soggy cinnamon roll, so I added one more step, coating the inside with some melted chocolate. (I used dark chocolate because I had some leftover from the bacon glasses, but white chocolate, almond bark, and candy melts would all work really well.) Once the chocolate set, I dipped the rims in the icing, and filled them with booze. I used Grand Marnier, but horchata liqueur or the suggested Bailey\u2019s would be pretty freaking tasty too. If you want to do shots at brunch, these are your guys. I\u2019d serve them at some sort of shower (baby or wedding), or a morning football game. Now things get a little fresher, a little lighter, and a little less involved. Cucumber shot glasses only require a little bit of knife work, plus some delicate scooping. To make them, I cut off a 1 ½-inch piece of cucumber and sliced off the end so it would sit flat. From there, I just scooped out the seedy flesh inside, rimmed it with a little ghost chile salt, and filled it with mezcal. (Gin would obviously be a great choice here too.) So these aren\u2019t the most exciting edible shot glasses, but they do hold their liquor fairly well, and cucumbers have the benefit of working with a variety of different liquors. I do however feel like you\u2019d end up tossing a lot of cucumbers if you were to serve these at a party, depending on how much ranch you have.  I couldn\u2019t find any peppermints at my local (stupid, Portland, hippy) grocery store, but I did find Jolly Ranchers, and I figured those would work just as well. I followed the procedure as laid out by the above video, melting candies on a Silpat and then draping them over a shot glass, gently pressing the hot sugar around it to shape. First attempt\u000aI was not, however, able to just \u201cpop it off\u201d once it was set, and the glass shattered when I tried to remove it. I re-did the whole thing, spraying the glass with a bit of cooking spray, and it slid off just fine. I then filled it with more of that cherry bourbon. Though I enjoyed making these, I wouldn\u2019t make them again. It takes a lot of Jolly Ranchers (10 per glass) and is slightly painful. I have made these with both green and golden kiwis, and feel fairly neutral towards both. They\u2019re not difficult to make, exactly, but you have to be pretty delicate in your scooping. Just slice off both rounded ends and scoop out the seedy flesh. Do not peel them first, as that will cause the whole kiwi to kind of mush out. Fill it with rum or something. These aren\u2019t the worst \u2014 at least they don\u2019t leak \u2014 but they are kind of ugly and frustrating to hollow out without wrecking everything. Here we have another porous fruit that works better in theory than practice. Though easy to make \u2014 just slice off the top and tip and scoop out the inside with a grapefruit spoon \u2014 they start leaking within a couple of minutes, and don\u2019t hold a lot of alcohol. I give this one a resounding \u201cEH.\u201d They appear far more cavernous in this photo than they actually were.\u000aThis one just didn\u2019t work. I toasted the marshmallow on all sides, as instructed by the video above but \u2014 unlike what happened in that same video \u2014 they never really collapsed to form a cavity for my booze. Since there wasn\u2019t a place to put any alcohol, I didn\u2019t put any in, which is probably for the best, as the the liquid would just melt the sugar anyway. I\u2019m not going to even bother answering the usual questions. This one, which is also from Oh, Bite It!, comes in dead last because it was a straight up betrayal. The instructions are simple enough: \u000aCut the Snickers in half, and gently push down in the center using either a knife or whatever will fit, creating a hole.\u000a Then you are supposed to fill that hole with booze. There are two major problems with this, however. First, it is almost impossible to create said hole without creating leaks and, if you do manage this incredible feat of delicate knife work, the hole is too small to hold any appreciable amount of alcohol. Boo. That was a lot of gimmicky nonsense, you guys, but I think we learned a lot. If you\u2019re going to make a ridiculous drinking vessel, you better go hard, and you better make it delicious. It also better hold your freaking booze because, without booze, what is the point of a shot glass? Photos by Claire Lower.

VIt\u2019s a good time to be a Supergirl fan.  Kara Zor-El from Argo City is having a mini-renaissance, with multiple comic-book titles and a TV series bearing her superhero name. There\u2019s more on the way, too: Yesterday, DC Comics announced a new high-profile miniseries called Supergirl: Being Super, written by Mariko Tamaki, drawn by Joelle Jones, and due out in December. Tamaki\u2019s an award-winning writer who co-created the hit comic This One Summer with cousin Jillian Tamaki and Jones has been nominated for an Eisner award \u2014 the comics medium\u2019s highest honour \u2014 for her work on Lady Killer and Helheim. The project stands apart from current DC continuity, a decision that seems to aim it for the broader mainstream audience that might be encountering Supergirl primarily through her TV show. Here\u2019s the official description from DC: \u000aImagine this: You\u2019re an alien. You have super powers. You are SUPERGIRL. But you\u2019re also 16, a teenager just trying to survive the day-to-day life of high school. The upside is, yes, you can fly, you can crush diamonds with your bare hands. The downside is that being super can be a super complicated and super confusing thing to be, especially when the whole being super thing is a secret.\u000a \u000aThis is the story of Kara Danvers, known to her home planet of Krypton as Kara Zor El. On the one hand, Kara is a typical teen, navigating relationships, friendships, and classes, on the other she\u2019s a being with immense power and potential, with the added responsibility of managing her developing super powers. As if transitioning into adulthood wasn\u2019t hard enough!\u000a \u000aAs Kara turns 16, her powers begin manifesting in bizarre hot flashes, glowing zits, symptoms that are becoming harder to control. That\u2019s right, two words, ALIEN ZITS. This new series is more than just heroics. It is the action-packed and heartfelt story of Kara Danvers and her attempts to balance the roles of teenager and hero.\u000a \u000aThis is a fresh take on Supergirl full of passion and ingenuity, with some added teenage irony. The first issue of the new series will debut December 28th, with subsequent issues being released every other month. Each issue is super-packed with 48-pages of story, in prestige format.\u000a Meanwhile, in the mainline DC Universe, Supergirl getting an infusion of fresh talent. After a prologue came out a week ago in the form of Supergirl: Rebirth, this week sees the start of a new Supergirl ongoing series. Supergirl #1 \u2014 written by Steve Orlando, with art by Brian Ching, Michael Atiyeh and Steve Wands \u2014 finds Kara poorly adjusting to a status quo in National City. While Supergirl\u2019s been on Earth for a good while now, she hasn\u2019t been participating with human society. The New 52 reboot re-imagined Kara as a maladjusted outsider who didn\u2019t want to fit in the way her cousin did. In a big divergence from past portrayals, her anger became a defining characteristic, to the point where she became a rage-powered Red Lantern for a while. All of that is in the past now, and after regaining her lost powers with the help of the Department of Extranormal Operations, she\u2019s trying on the new secret identity of Kara Danvers, with DEO agents playing the role of her foster parents. All the elements that made Orlando\u2019s run on Midnighter so enjoyable show up here as well, just with less limb-exploding ultraviolence. His strong grasp of character dynamics and voicings make the inevitable frictions and friendships feel inviting and he\u2019s finding fresh angles for a character who\u2019s been around for decades. For example, Kara harbours a little quirk of speech in this issue that has her referring to Krypton in the present tense. It\u2019s a heartbreaking device that drives home how fresh all of this loss and adjustment is for her. There\u2019s a strong undercurrent of nostalgic sadness in this first issue, which switches back between showing Kara preparing to triumphantly enter young adulthood back on Krypton and struggling to adjust to adolescent rites of passage on Earth. When I spoke with Orlando two weeks ago, the writer said his aim for the new series was to define Kara as a Supergirl without using Superman as a reference. There\u2019s a brief flashback to an interaction with her now-dead cousin, which underscores her own loneliness. But it\u2019s not all downers in Supergirl #1. Kara\u2019s screw-ups with basic skills like driving a car or using a classroom projector add humour to the proceedings, as does a snippy encounter with self-aggrandizing reporter Cat Grant. Ching\u2019s linework is fun and loose, nimbly allowing for cartoony expressiveness and exaggeration without regressing into caricature. This new Supergirl nods at the sunny tonality and some elements of the CW series, but feels like its own thing: a teenage soap opera of a girl trying to find her place in the world while authority figures dog her every superpowered move.

VWe\u2019ve only had three movies in DC\u2019s Extended Universe so far, but we\u2019ve already got confirmation that at least one of the upcoming films won\u2019t be a part of that shared universe initiative.\u000a\u000aSpeaking to Vulture, Greg Berlanti \u2014 who only just recently confirmed that the movie exists \u2014 revealed that Booster Gold was actually born out of a long-in-the-works TV series he planned to do with fellow DC TV collaborator Andrew Kreisberg. But more interestingly, Berlanti also confirmed that there are no plans to tie the film (and Booster\u2019s time-travelling hijinks) into the current slate of DC\u2019s interconnected movies: \u000aAs of right now we have no connective tissue to those worlds. It\u2019d be a separate thing.\u000a So after Warner Bros. and DC were so eager to chase after the shared cinematic universe popularity of other studios like Marvel, they\u2019re now\u2026 trying to have it both ways? You can see why Warner might be a bit apprehensive about trying to bring in a character as weird and zany as Booster Gold into its very self-serious DC Extended Universe \u2014 but at the same time, what\u2019s the point of pushing the interconnected hook between these movies so hard (arguably to the point of detracting from the films themselves, in the case of Batman v Superman), only to immediately start abandoning it? The joy of shared universes like this is that the serious can sit alongside the silly (just look at Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy) or the grim can sit alongside the hopeful (Arrow and Flash, now with added Supergirl) and still be part of a larger whole. It\u2019s an interesting move for DC to Warner Bros. to make, but one I\u2019m not entirely sure I can see the point of just yet. Thats kinda of stupid, Booster is at his best when interacting with the rest of teh DC universe.\u000aPartnering with Batman, or Ted Kord or even other versions of himself to help/hinder the universe as a whole. Or simply referencing the whole Justice League problem from a separate angle  There's connected, and theres Connected, and it doesnt need to add to the greater picture to still be part of the EU. A simple line that he was inspired by what Batman did with Justice League, "and we all remember what happened there" and you have your connection without detail.  Would be so simple. Not sure why they completely separate it either, for the same reasons as in the story - they've gone out of their way to make an EU, at least in the movies, so this makes no sense at all. I can see keeping TV and movies separate (dont necessarily agree, but can see reasons), but within the movie industry all they do is risk confusing their fans.

What they should do is sit back down, STFU, and be silent until their betters deign to give them a tidbit, at which point they should politely say "Thank you". Too many Veruca Salt's on the internet. Since it was shown at Comic Con I'm surprised it hasn't been released yet.\u000aI guess they're keeping it under their hat until Dr Strange is released.

VCheck your car over before driving in the snow and don\u2019t forget your emergency supplies Keeping your vehicle well maintained is important all year round, but even more so in winter. With snow on the way across Britain this week, ProofCam, the dash cam manufacturer, has put together some tips to help drivers who are setting off in winter weather to arrive at their destinations safely.  1. Check the weather conditions! Seems obvious, but before setting off it\u2019s worth checking sites like RAC Traffic Information and Highways Agency Traffic Information for real-time information. You can always keep an ear out for travel and weather updates from the car radio too. It\u2019s also sensible to let relatives and friends know your intended route and expected arrival time and, where possible, travel with others. 2. Check the screen wash\u000aMake sure you have enough screen wash and that the concentration is suitable for cold conditions. You should be looking for protection that goes down to -10 degrees Celsius and if you live in areas subject to the greatest extremes of weather, down to -20 degrees. If you don\u2019t use a good quality screen wash there is a danger your washer pump could freeze. This might well lead to the fuse blowing and your wipers not working because they are often on the same fuse. 3. Do you have enough anti-freeze?\u000aEnsure that your coolant is between the minimum and maximum markers. It\u2019s also important that there is sufficient anti-freeze in the coolant. If you\u2019re uncertain, have a look at your handbook or get a local garage to check the strength. Anti-freeze is cheap but damage from a frozen engine can be very expensive to fix. Get a little electric pump such as the Ring RAC630 digital tyre Inflator 4. Are your tyres up to the job? Check the conditions of your tyres to see if there is adequate tread. Look for damage such as splits or bulges and, of course, check the pressure. While you can usually check the pressure at a petrol station, it can work out quite expensive. Far better is to invest in a little electric pump that plugs into the cigarette lighter and leave it in the back of your car. Halfords has a good selection to choose from here, from around £20. If you live in an area at particular at risk of snow consider purchasing winter tyres or snow socks which give you greater traction and control. 5. Wiperblades Check wiper blades for damage and replace if necessary. When wiper blades become frozen to glass it is very easy to damage them when freeing them up. 6. Make sure you have emergency supplies!  Obviously you don\u2019t want to break down, but it\u2019s always important to gather a few items at the start of the winter season and keep them in your car \u2013 just in case.

VNegotiating a good deal is an art. But you need to know your priorities first, and what actually makes a deal good before you start. So before you begin, rate each negotiable item on a scale of 10 so that you know what matters to you.\u000a\u000aSomething that matters a lot to you, like non-negotiable leave during the holidays, would be a 10. Something you don\u2019t care about, like remote working, would be a one. If either of those matter more or less, rate them in between. It\u2019s best to do this for your own reference. No sense in showing your cards unnecessarily, so don\u2019t come in and say \u201cleave is a 10 on my list\u201d to your potential boss. That said, John Rampton of Inc. says he even opens up the rating at times a little. \u000aWant to know how strongly you or your counterpart wants something? Put a number on it. A number 1, for example is neutral, and 10 would be something you can\u2019t live without. Hopefully this will lead to both parties eventually comprising or coming up with an alternative. This has allowed me in the past to be very direct with the other party in letting them know what I\u2019m not willing to leave on the table.\u000a Read Rampton\u2019s full article for other tips to negotiate any deal, like labelling emotions to drive a point home. 13 Negotiating Techniques That Never Fail [Inc.]

V\u000a\u000a Name: Nonda ZUS\u000aType: Smart car finder and USB charger (pictured above)\u000aSpecs: Click here for full specs\u000aPrice: $35.99\u000a\u000aName: Nonda iHere\u000aType: Smart key finder\u000aSpecs: Click here for full specs\u000aPrice: $19.99\u000a \u000aCalifornian company Nonda isn\u2019t particularly well known outside the US, but the firm first came to our attention with its crowd funding campaign for its ZUS smart car charger on Indiegogo. Since then we\u2019ve also tested its smart key ring, the iHere, although these aren\u2019t the only smart gadgets the company \u2013 which only started in 2014 \u2013 has produced. Also available via its website are what\u2019s billed as the smallest USB-C to USB 3.0 Mini Adaptor and the Hub+ which gives you loads of extra ports for your MacBook Air or MacBook Pro including three USB-A, two USB-C sockets and an SD card reader.     Nonda Smart car charger Plug in USB sockets for the car are now extremely commonplace. With more and more of us relying on charging our gadgets in the car, there has never been a greater need for in car USB. But although most modern cars now have USB sockets, the reality is that if you are driving a car more than a few years old you need a socket that plugs into the cigarette lighter. The Nonda Smart car charger actually features two USB sockets in one so you can charge two mobile devices (say a mobile phone and an iPad) at the same time. However, that\u2019s not the really clever thing about this gadget. What makes the car charger really \u2018smart\u2019 is that it will also automatically set the car\u2019s exact location when it stops and send this information to your mobile phone so you don\u2019t have to worry about where you last left your vehicle. That\u2019s particularly handy if you left your car in a field at a festival or music concert or even in a large multi storey car park where all the floors tend to look the same.  Nonda iHere Like the Nonda ZUS smart car charger, the iHere (pictured above) is also intended to help you find a lost item although in this case it\u2019s primarily intended to help you find your keys or other small items to which it can be attached. The device is charged via the adaptor on the bottom of the smart triangular-shaped device and this plugs into the USB adaptor on your computer. Nonda claims that the device can go for several weeks without needing to be recharged, although it\u2019s not something we\u2019re able to confirm yet. However, I have been using the device several days and it is still showing 100% charge so that\u2019s a good thing. What\u2019s more the handy little device doesn\u2019t just help you find your keys. It can also be used to take selfies, find your car, call your phone, even record voice memos via the companion app should you wish to. Read on to find out a little more about this slightly random selection of features. \u000aZUS smartphone app Inevitably both products need to be used with their respective Apple iOS or Google Play apps in order to provide full functionality. Obviously it\u2019s possible to use the ZUS as a standalone USB charger for your car but that would be a little bit of a waste of its undoubted talents. Similarly you need to have the iHere app in order to help find your keys using the smart phone. How the ZUS works is that it when you park your car and the engine is stopped is it automatically sends a message via Bluetooth to your smartphone which then records your exact GPS location. The app doesn\u2019t need to be open for the location to be stored, but the downside is that obviously \u2018Location Services\u2019 need to be switched on the whole time for the app to work. This can obviously drain the smartphone\u2019s battery which can be a problem especially on an iPhone where as we all know battery life isn\u2019t the best. Once you\u2019ve parked you get a little message from the app telling you that you\u2019ve parked up and asking you whether you want to set a timer. It\u2019s a really neat feature especially if you are parking in a pay and display car park and want a reminder about when to return to the car to fill up the meter. To find your way back to the car there are two screens \u2013 a standard map display which pinpoints where you are in relation to your car and a compass display (see below) which shows you how far away your car is (in feet or metres) and in what direction. It will also let you know how long it has been since you parked up.    Nonda iHere app Slightly different and a little more complex is the Nonda iHere app. Basically this app operates in two modes: Click and Find. The most common way of using it is in Find mode. So, for example, if you put your keys down in the house and can\u2019t remember where you put them then by pressing the Find button within the iHere\u2019s app an alert will be sent and the key fob will start beeping. In order presumably to save battery life the iHere uses Bluetooth for the Find function so range is limited to around 25m but that\u2019s enough for use in the house where, let\u2019s face it, you have probably left your keys! If you are further away than 25m then you will see a map which shows the last known location of the keys. There is also a \u2018separation alarm\u2019 button which means that if your keys and phone part company for whatever reason, the alarm will automatically go off. Less likely to be used, but interesting nevertheless, is Click mode. In this mode you are presented with four options: Call Phone, Take Selfies, Car Finder and Voice Recorder. With these options you need to press the relevant button on the phone and then use the click button on the front of the iHere. So, for example, by pressing the Take Selfies button you automatically open up the front facing camera button on the phone. To take a picture you then just press the button on the iHere gadget rather than having to press another button on the phone. The voice recorder option works in a similar way although I\u2019m even less sure why you would need to use a smart key ring to act as a trigger for the recording. The car finder option is interesting though because it enables you to set your vehicle\u2019s location via GPS manually whereas with its sister product the Nonda ZUS you need to have GPS enabled the entire time which can drain the battery. However you do need to press two buttons, first the car finder button within your smartphone\u2019s app, followed by the button on the front of the iHere smart key ring. The distance and direction of your car is then shown within the compass display in a similar way to the ZUS interface. You can use the iHere in two modes \u2013 find mode or click mode Performance In a sense it\u2019s difficult to evaluate the performances of these products as they are not intended for everyday use. Instead their function is really for use in times of moderate distress \u2013 either you are not sure where you have parked or you can\u2019t remember where you have left your keys (hopefully not an everyday occurrence!) With the Nonda ZUS I have found myself mainly using the device as a double USB charger rather than a car finder. That\u2019s primarily because I don\u2019t want to leave location services for the app switched on the whole time because it massively reduces battery life. However it would be quite possible to switch location services on temporarily if you know you are going to park in a field or somewhere without any distinguishing features such as large multi storey park. The iHere on the other hand has already proved a handy little gadget for finding my keys from my smartphone (I tend to always have my phone by my side but the keys can be anywhere in the house.) \u000aVerdict: For the person who has virtually everything, these Nonda gadgets are great. They work well and are very reasonably priced.  If you\u2019ve ever got lost trying to find your car in a field (as I have done at festivals several times) then you\u2019ll appreciate the ZUS. Similarly, if you can never find your keys when you are planning to leave the house the iHere will prove useful.\u000a\u000a  Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VEight years after its release, Iron Man is still very much the defining movie of Marvel\u2019s cinematic universe, representing everything Marvel stands for with its approach to superhero movies. But if Greg Berlanti, the man behind the Arrow, Flash and Supergirl TV series had his way, it would have been quite different.\u000a\u000aIn an extensive interview with the producer for Vulture, Berlanti revealed that in 2005, in the earliest stages of Marvel\u2019s work on an Iron Man movie project, Berlanti pitched his own take on the character, one that was a little bleaker than the snarky, charming Tony Stark we would eventually see: \u000aWhat was your first superhero project? Was there something early on that never came to fruition?\u000a\u000aI kept telling people in the industry that I loved comic books as a kid when Iron Man hadn\u2019t been made yet. I pitched on that.\u000a\u000aYou pitched an Iron Man movie?\u000a\u000aI did, yeah. Somewhere around 2005.\u000a\u000aWhat was your pitch?\u000a\u000aThere was that movie with Nic Cage where he\u2019s a gunrunner. Lord of War. Marvel wanted that feeling. Tony [Stark] was an alcoholic in it by then. My pitch certainly wasn\u2019t as good as the eventual film. So everyone made the right choice.\u000a It\u2019s interesting to see that originally Marvel was going to portray Stark\u2019s weapon-selling as apparently something a bit more morally bankrupt than what we see in the film, where Tony is just sort of an arsehole who happens to sell weapons, before very quickly discarding that part of himself to become Iron Man. Or that even Iron Man\u2019s infamous problems with alcohol were going to play a much larger part than they ever did in any of the movies (even Iron Man 2, which briefly alluded to the plot line in the drunken party scene). As Berlanti says, the pitch was passed on, and the film we got gave us a much softer Tony Stark \u2014 and an incredibly popular Tony Stark at that. Still, what might have been remains an interesting prospect, given how Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s Iron Avenger remains the arc reactor-ed heart of the wider Marvel movieverse.

Coffee\u2019s bitter, roasted flavour is the perfect compliment to a ton of savoury dishes, and it adds unexpected dimension to meats, vegetables and even chilli. A couple of our favourite methods:. Of course, it\u2019s not all savoury. Coffee plays well with the sweeter things in life as well. A cup of coffee is a natural pairing for sweet, sugary pastries, but it\u2019s also a real superstar ingredient when used in desserts. Here are some sweet ways to incorporate the bitter beverage into your baking. As you can see from all of its glorious uses, coffee is truly a bean that can do both.

VIt\u2019s hard to decide who\u2019s the worse villain: John Travolta or Nicolas Cage. And that\u2019s exactly why Face/Off is the perfect mid-\u201990s action thriller. Who do you root for? Unclear because the main characters switched faces, and it\u2019s hard to tell who the good guy is. The effect is intoxicating.\u000a\u000aFace/Off is a John Woo-directed pulp action thriller, a movie about a psychotic criminal and a too-committed cop: Cage and Travolta, respectively. Cage plays ruthless criminal Castor Troy, and Travolta plays heroic FBI agent Sean Archer. At least, until they switch faces. Cage has killed Travolta\u2019s son. Then, Travolta fails to kill Cage, but manages to get a face transplant so that he can assume Cage\u2019s identity. And then, Cage wakes up from a coma, forces a doctor to transplant Travolta\u2019s face on his head, and moves into Travolta\u2019s house to screw things up. This is obviously a complicated situation. Travolta goes to gaol and gets his arse kicked a bunch. Cage\u2019s nerdy brother has all kinds of trouble figuring out who to trust. And Travolta\u2019s wife is put in a terribly awkward situation, since she thinks that this man with her husband\u2019s face is her husband when he\u2019s really her husband\u2019s worst enemy. It\u2019s a real wild ride. The first time I saw Face/Off, I was a stupid teenager, so the basic plot points were enough to occupy my brain. The movie seemed exciting and unspeakably weird, based on the fact that Travolta and Cage switch faces less than an hour into it. But in retrospect, Face/Off is a movie that sums up an era. America was optimistic about technology and in the midst of a short-lived peacetime. Writers had to get extra creative about action movies. (Remember, this was the era of Demolition Man.) What I didn\u2019t realise in 1997, when the movie hit theatres, was the extent to which the face swap and the framing of terrorism was weirdly prescient. Two decades ago, Hollywood imagined terrorism as an open-ended plot engine, a handy way to name characters as villains and root a plot in a smarmy sludge of this-would-never-really-happen. (Picture the seemingly impossible plots of Con Air or The Rock for some Nic Cage-fuelled reference points.) Making a movie\u2019s hero swap faces with the villain seemed like a silly gimmick, but movies were brimming with silly gimmicks back then. But the world is different now. Face transplants are a real thing. The lurking threat of terrorism is a real thing. It\u2019s still pretty implausible that the FBI would put a criminal\u2019s face onto an agent to infiltrate a ring of domestic terrorists. The notion that ruthless killers living double lives that have the capacity to blow up entire cities is hardly fanciful. This is a real thing, too. All that said, Face/Off is still a thrill to watch. Not only did it make me feel nostalgic for the calm of the mid-\u201990s; it also made me consider how far we\u2019ve come since then, in good ways and bad. I like that Face/Off leaves you guessing. Face transplants are crazy, but are they also scary? (Hint: No.) Terrorism is definitely scary, but is it also ridiculous to think that some some psychopath would level Los Angeles? (Hint: No.) It\u2019s refreshing to watch a cheesy action movie that seems somehow self-aware, even in its utter absurdity. It\u2019s also startling to realise that Face/Off might not be as absurd as it once was. Nearly 20 years later \u2014 and seen with a more experienced set of eyes \u2014 the Nic Cage masterpiece is even more exhilarating than it was the first time I saw it. Watching Face/Off feels like dusting off a precious vintage, twisting in the corkscrew and popping the bottle. Even if it tastes like vinegar, the whole experience is a blast You should watch Face/Off again. Consider what crime seemed like in the mid- to late-\u201990s and laugh at the bonkers idea of a criminal and a cop trading faces. It\u2019s especially fun, because our reality is worse. Sure, it\u2019s amazing that face transplants exist. They\u2019re also a transformative development. But the idea of a Nic Cage \u2014 a spliff-smoking, fast-talking, womanising son of a bitch \u2014 seems rather quaint compared to the real threat of global terrorism. When the truth is scarier than fiction, escaping into the sweet embrace of a mid-\u201990s action thriller like Face/Off isn\u2019t a bad way to detach from reality for a few hours. Loved this movie. As an impressionable teen, the scene depicted in the last screenshot blew my mind up. Yeah, I was watching Hard Target the other week which John Woo directed a few years before Face Off and noticed it has a near identical scene in it towards the end, just without the mirrors. I think its also a great movie that shows off the acting abilities of both actors by getting them to switch personalities half way This and Con Air are a great movie marathon combo. Brilliant movie and in typical John Woo style has doves flying past during a shootout in a church. Classic. Edit: Our current Islam Extremist based terrorism is much scarier then Cage's terrorist. And luckily, for now, face transplants are pretty munted still. But I remember thinking face transplants would be impossible when I first watched it. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 2:48 pm								 Peach. I could eat a peach for hours.  Classic Cage. The author sounds like a worry wart. He uses a movie to really vent his security anxieties in a less obvious way. Terrorism is hardly as threatening as the media and politicians would have you believe. It needs to be put into perspective. You're more likely to die from falling down stairs or drugs than a terrorist attack, but where is the hysteria about that. People should be smarter than to fall for the agenda-driven coverage of terrorism that we are fed.

VIt doesn\u2019t seem you can go a day without some new wearable asking for money on crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter or Indiegogo. But here\u2019s one that promises to be more useful than most \u2013 in fact so useful it might actually save your life one day. Called Kingii, it\u2019s a device that claims to help prevent drowning. Although the number of deaths from drowning in the UK is falling (just under 400 last year according to the latest stats from Rospa), worldwide drowning still kills 372,000 according to the World Health Organisation. And obviously during the summer time when people \u2013 some of whom are not great swimmers or can\u2019t swim at all \u2013 jump or dive into extremely cold water to cool off, drownings are far more likely to occur. \u201cUnfortunately, the Kingii team has a personal connection with drowning,\u201d the company\u2019s founder, Tom Agapiades, told  WIRED.co.uk. \u201cA dear friend of ours drowned in a lake, and it could have been prevented. We don\u2019t want anyone to experience losing a loved one, especially when they can be saved.\u201d So how does the wearable work? Billed as \u2018the world\u2019s smallest floatation device\u2018, it\u2019s a wristband that has a lever which, when pulled, triggers the \u201cKingii Cylinder\u201d (a CO2 cartridge). This fills a small pouch, which in turn becomes the flotation device. It takes just one second to deploy and also on board the tiny device are a whistle and a built-in compass which could help anyone lost at sea to find the shore. It can be reused by taking off the cylinder, repacking the deflated pouch, and replacing with a new cylinder. \u201cOther than the traditional life vest, there haven\u2019t been any other attempts [at tackling the problem],\u201d says Agapiades. \u201cWhile there are some devices that allow parents to monitor children in the water, Kingii is the only wearable that actually has floatation capabilities.\u201d At the time of writing, Kingii\u2019s Indiegogo campaign has already raised  $400,000 on a $65,000 funding goal. You can buy the product for $69 (including two cylinders) on an \u2018early bird special. It goes into production later in the year.      Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

Now, 17 years after that phenomenon, the new Blair Witch movie is doing something similar.\u000a Lisa, played by Callie Hernandez, is the subject of some cool Blair Witch viral marketing. Image: Lionsgate In the sequel, which opens September 16, a character named James heads into the Maryland woods because he believes his sister, Heather, is still alive. (Heather was the main character of the original film.) He\u2019s joined by several friends and a filmmaker named Lisa, who seems very interested in in James\u2019 story. Knowing that, a Kickstarter found by IndieWire looks to be the start of a second story. It\u2019s for a film called The Absence of Closure, directed by Lisa Arlington, who wants her film to explore \u201cthe tragedy of ambiguous loss.\u201d You know, like having a sister disappear in the woods. Her main subject\u2019s name is, you guessed it, James. The creepiest thing about the Kickstarter is that it was \u201cfully funded\u201d and Lisa set off to make the film, then never returned. A few clicks away is a Tumblr page with this as the final entry: \u000aQuick update from the road: we\u2019re now heading toward our first big location shoot in what locals call the Black Hills Forest. I\u2019m so excited about the footage we\u2019re going to get in these beautiful, mysterious woods. Photos and videos to come! -Lisa\u000a That post is dated May 12, 2014. Going back to Kickstarter, there is an update from August 2016 that authorities have given up on Lisa and her family needs help. They even set up a Facebook page and the photo of Lisa looks a lot like actress Callie Hernandez, who plays the filmmaker character Lisa in the film. The page has several \u201cnews articles\u201d about the disappearance. Here\u2019s one: The Frederick Daily is not a real publication, but check out the ad on the lower-right \u2014 Jessabelle was a movie released back in 2014 by Lionsgate, who just so happens to be releasing Blair Witch. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely intriguing,\u201d Blair Witch producer Keith Calder told io9 when asked about the Kickstarter. \u201cAs a major Kickstarter supporter over the years, I hope those backers get what they want from the project, and that Lisa Arlington is ok.\u201d How deep does this social media, online, viral marketing go? Will it reveal anything about the film? We\u2019ll have to wait and see.

VAnother familiar face is confirmed for Transformers: The Last Knight. Bruce Campbell ruminates on whether Ash vs Evil Dead could ever link up to the Evil Dead reboot. Plus, what\u2019s to come on Once Upon a Time, and a new still from Supergirl. Spoilers now!\u000a According to Walter Jones, who played Zack in the original series, none of the original cast were invited to make cameo appearances in the film: \u000aIt\u2019s not likely. Unfortunately, we were not invited to be part of the film, which is confusing to me, but I\u2019m excited about the film nevertheless.\u000a [Audibly Exquisite Podcast] Stanley Tucci will reprise his role as Joshua Joyce in the film. [Variety] Here\u2019s a new picture of Jyn Erso in chains at the Yavin IV base, courtesy of Yahoo\u2019s movie previews. Den of Geek asked Bruce Campbell if the series will ever catch up with the story of the Evil Dead remake: \u000aCan we expect to see the story of the remake meet up with the show at any point?\u000a\u000aYou can\u2019t expect anything. In the Evil Dead movies you can only expect the unexpected. These were never designed to be a franchise. These were a very slow growing series of movies and the TV show was a natural outgrowth; it made more sense to do a TV show than a 75-million-dollar movie, for example. It\u2019s dictated by economics and look, a lot of the difference between Army Of Darkness and now is that Army Of Darkness flopped, which most people forget; the series was dead after that. It took until the late \u201990s to rekindle it on DVD, so we\u2019re actually really glad to celebrate the release of the Ash Vs Evil Dead DVD so DVD collectors can add it to the rest of the series.\u000a Here\u2019s an incredibly lengthy synopsis for the next season of the show. \u000aWelcome to Storybrooke, a small town in Maine that you won\u2019t find on any map. This town is full of magic, populated by fairytale characters once cursed by the Evil Queen Regina to live in our world \u2014 deprived of their memories and happy endings. Until Emma Swan came to town and changed everything. With the help of her son, Henry, Emma embraced her true identity as the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming \u2014 the Saviour destined to break the Curse. But even after returning everyone\u2019s memories, Emma\u2019s mission was far from over. With the Curse broken, Mr. Gold (aka Rumplestiltskin) was free to bring magic to Storybrooke. And magic ALWAYS comes with a price\u2026\u000a\u000aAs \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d returns to ABC for its sixth season, so does its classic villain \u2014 the Evil Queen. Creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz (\u201cLost,\u201d \u201cTron: Legacy\u201d) invite you to join everyone\u2019s favourite fairytale characters as they face-off against this supercharged enemy.\u000a\u000aWhen Regina split herself in an attempt to eliminate her evil half, she unwittingly released the Evil Queen. Now the Evil Queen is back and ready to leave a trail of destruction in her wake. Meanwhile, Regina is quickly learning that destroying her dark side won\u2019t be that easy, especially when dealing with the consequences of having unleashed the Queen on Storybrooke. Emma learns a life-altering secret that could have serious consequences for her family and loved ones. While the heroes grapple with what Emma is confronting, Henry welcomes the new arrivals from the Land of Untold Stories by pledging to help them complete their tales. But when Snow White, Prince Charming, Regina, Captain Hook and Zelena become entwined in these untold tales, they find themselves haunted by their own unfinished pasts. Meanwhile, after handing Storybrooke over to Mr. Hyde, Mr. Gold continues his quest to wake Belle from her self-induced sleeping curse, in hopes of reuniting with both her and their unborn child.\u000a\u000aThis season our heroes will be met with many surprises, including Aladdin (Deniz Akdeniz), a former Saviour who may be able to offer Emma just the help she needs, Jafar (Oded Fehr), Princess Jasmine (Karin David), the Count of Monte Cristo (Craig Horner) and Morpheus (Giles Matthey).\u000a [KSiteTV] Expect \u201csmaller, personal\u201d stories and more Castiel-centric plots in the next season, according to new showrunner Andrew Dabb: \u000aIt\u2019s about telling smaller stories that impact more of our characters. For example, this year, especially toward the middle of the season, we\u2019re using Castiel in stand-alone episodes in a way that he hasn\u2019t been used in a long time.\u000a [EW] A synopsis for the second episode, \u201cLupus in Fabula\u201d, has been released. \u000aWhile Bishop Egan denies Tomas permission to perform the exorcism of Angela\u2019s daughter, Father Marcus breaks out of Saint Aquinas and joins forces with Tomas, though he urges him to get his ex, Jessica, out of his life and heart. The Rance family\u2019s relationship with the demon deepens and when Marcus catches Angela stealing holy water, he instructs her on how to use it.

VHaving a perfect pair of goggles is like having a superpower: You can see clearly underwater, and the goggles feel as natural as a part of your own body. Finding that perfect pair can take some trial and error, though. Here are the things you\u2019ll want to know when you start your search.\u000a\u000aIllustration by Sam Woolley. Swim goggles come in a huge variety of shapes and styles to fit the needs of different swimmers. Prices vary, but you should be able to find something that fits and works well for under $35, and often a lot less. Here are some of the things you may want to consider: These considerations should give you some ideas for which brands and models of goggles will work for you. The real test, though, is whether your chosen goggle actually fits. A pair of goggles can only keep water out of your eyes if it makes an airtight seal with your face. Everybody\u2019s face is shaped a little differently, so the goggles that work for your friend might not work for you. You can check the fit of a pair of goggles without putting your face in the water. Stick the goggles to your face, without putting the strap on your head, and press hard. The GIF above shows you how, or check out the full video for more. If the goggles stay on your face for a few seconds, you know you have a good fit. Next, you need to decide how they feel. If the nose piece digs into the bridge of your nose, or if the goggles are uncomfortably tight around your eyes, that\u2019s a dealbreaker. Anything that\u2019s uncomfortable in the store will feel even worse by the end of a long workout. Swimmers who prefer tiny, tight goggles for racing often use a more comfortable pair for their everyday swims. While you\u2019re experimenting with fit, don\u2019t be afraid to look beyond the label. If you\u2019re shopping in the women\u2019s category, try looking at men\u2019s goggles if you need a bigger size, and vice versa. Kids\u2019 goggles offer another option, too: My goggles always leaked until I borrowed my son\u2019s pair one day. It turned out I just needed a smaller size. With so many things to consider, it helps to go to a store where you can try on as many goggles as possible. If you order online, consider the store\u2019s return policy. With a little trial and error, you should be able to find the perfect pair. Malmsteen Swedish goggles are the best. Worn by Thorpey and many pros even today. No neoprene to wear out. Do yourself a favour.

VSaving lives and creating more livable communities are just two of the reasons given by researchers as to why there should be a nationwide reduction of local speed limits from 50km/h to 40km/h \u2014 pointing to 30km/h limits on roads in Europe as an example. Marina Alexander and Dr Mark King, from QUT\u2019s Centre for Accident Research & Road Safety \u2013 Queensland (CARRS-Q) say because there was a default speed limit of 50km/h in built-up areas, unless otherwise signed, this had become the default speed limit for local streets as well as for other roads in built-up areas, such as collector roads and some arterial roads. \u201cWe say 50km/h is too high for local streets, which is why we are seeing 40km/h zones around schools and shopping areas introduced all over the country as local governments respond to public demand for lower speeds,\u201d Ms Alexander said. \u201cMany countries in Europe have introduced 30km/h for local streets and these countries lead the world in road safety outcomes.\u201d Ms Alexander said local streets were typically characterised by their mix of traffic, which included vulnerable or unprotected road users such as pedestrians, cyclists and people on motorised mobility scooters. \u201cThe latest Queensland road crash statistics show a disturbing trend of increased fatalities and serious injuries for pedestrians and cyclists,\u201d Ms Alexander said. \u201cIf a person in a motor vehicle is involved in a road crash at 50km/h they have a 10 per cent or less chance of being killed. Those are pretty good odds\u201d.  However, if an unprotected person, such as a cyclist or pedestrian is involved, their chances of being killed rise to between 50 and 80 per cent. \u201cSafer vehicles and safer streets are key elements to increasing road safety for motorists but the effect is marginal for vulnerable people who do not necessarily benefit from technical improvements in vehicles or road infrastructure.\u201d Ms Alexander said while a difference of 10km/h had the potential to save lives, it did not necessarily mean slower trips. \u201cResearch has demonstrated in most urban trips under 20 minutes, higher speeds make little difference to travel time and in some cases lower speeds could reduce travel time due to improvements in traffic flow,\u201d she said. \u201cBut from a safety perspective there are huge gains we can make\u201d. Higher impact speeds lead to the exertion of greater force, and a higher magnitude of injury for an unprotected person. Slower speeds produce less kinetic energy resulting in less serious injuries. Slower speeds also allow for longer reaction times, greater braking distance and a decrease in the likelihood of crashing. Ms Alexander said speed limit changes in the late 1990s in Queensland, NSW and Victoria from 60km/h to 50km/h saw a reduction in road deaths of 15 per cent. \u201cIt\u2019s time to continue this downward trend,\u201d she said. \u201cMore people are choosing to walk, cycle or use alternative forms of transport instead of driving. This positive change brings with it new demands on the road network. We argue that lowering the speed limit is a fundamental to achieving safer local streets for all people.\u201d I have no rebuttal for this that doesn't invovle extreme profanity. ^this You win the internet today sir. They already have 40km/h around local shops in my area. They could introduce it in the CBD and surrounds as well. I've always thought 50 is too fast in areas with lots of pedestrians, and 90/100 is much too slow on our freeways. I disagree that even slower speeds in local streets will mean less pedestrian deaths. In all of NSW this year so far 54 people have died - a 23% increase over last year. The majority of them being (drunk?) adults. The ACRS says that accidents with pedestrians often happened when\u000a- Pedestrians not looking, particularly on zebra crossings.\u000a- Pedestrians not waiting for a clear gap at refuges.\u000a- Pedestrians running across the road at any location.   Educating people about looking after themselves and their kids would, in my opinion, produce better results than more signs. As would educating drivers about how to be better drivers while negotiating local streets. The research is pretty clear. If you hit a pedestrian, they will come off second best, every single time. You can try to educate kids all you want but they lack the judgement and reasoning capability that most adults have, so they're going to forget at some point, and if that point happens to involve a car coming at them, they're likely to be seriously injured or killed. I don't agree with this plan for arterial roads that should be purpose built to adequately separate pedestrians and cars (and cyclists, we make special concessions for them too despite the risk being even worse because they deliberately mix with cars) but for local streets there's zero reason to be against it. These aren't high capacity, long straight roads - these are local residential streets and shopping centres with either significant pedestrian traffic or the serious risk of sudden pedestrian movement. If you have any defensive driving skills at all, you're not hooning down them anyway. Sorry, your argument is invalid. Use of logic not allowed. If the research and trials back really back this up then do it. Say is priority. I do think this needs to be considered on a whole state or country level though, streets in residential areas vary greatly, and are different from a lot of European cities too where some of the evidence heralds. I also think more responsibility (with training!) needs to pushed onto the driver because conditions vary and a fixed speed limit can only do so much. That, combined with a more radical look at better road design & continually improving car safety should offer big improvements before we touch speed limits. All that stuff is expensive and hard though... I think 50kph is a fairly common urban speed, it's about the same in the US and UK (30mph). Any slower and you would get so bored that you probably won't be paying attention anyway, and probably hit someone at a higher speed than if you were doing 50 but alert and brake in time. The below is interesting, does this mean if we get together and demand that they abolish speed limits on the highways then it would happen?? ...local governments respond to public demand for lower speeds \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 8:05 am								 This whole "you're so bored you're not paying attention" just means you're a shit driver. This isn't driving in the outback on a straight road with nothing around you, it's driving on local streets. If a 10km/hr drop in a zone destroys your concentration, particularly on a road where a pedestrian might dart in front of you, if your attention span is that short, then you shouldn't be driving and are part of the problem. I think your right, it does mean your a shit driver. If you have ever looked around, most people on our roads are shit.\u000aSlow them down and they will start texting and reading the news.\u000aTheory looks good, slow down=softer impacts. However bored drivers will cause far more problems. Its a reality that already exists because 50 is too slow.\u000aPedestrians and bycycles should be banned from roads. This will eliminate the problem. Total nonsense, if you're distracted while driving in a school zone, you shouldn't have a license period. People text and play with their phone while driving at any speed, it has nothing to do with speed and everything to do with people having shitty attitudes towards driving - that they can do no wrong and the misconception that their skill exceeds any potential conditions. Because we can't seem to change people's attitudes, the government brings in regulation. If people want fewer restrictions, the average level of driving capability needs to improve. And based on some of the comments on this post, clearly we're not getting anywhere near that state. Absolutely. I'm all for mandatory retesting when a license is renewed. Fail the test, no license. Watch forum members bitch about that! So reducing the urban speeds from 60 to 50 kph reduced the toll by 15%, why don't we continue to follow this trend - reduce the speed to zero and have 100% reduction in the road toll?   If we actually wanted to drive, we could always bring back the Red Flag Act where drivers of automobiles had to have someone on foot walk in front of them to warn pedestrians.\u000a/sarcasm Lets say the powers that be lower teh speed limits, will the gov't then pay me for the extra hour it takes to get to and from work each day?\u000aWill they give my employer an incentive to lower my hours without changing my pay so that i can fit these new slower speed limits into my daily life?\u000aGiven on average we spent 8 hours sleeping, an hour to get ready for work, 2 hours in traffic, 8 hours at work (minimum) thats 18 hours roughly of a 24 hour day gone already, who the hell has time to spend an extra hour in traffic a day? For anyone that wants to say "Use public transport or ride", try using public transport ion QLD, its unreliable and ludicrously expensive, and if im already driving an hour to work each day riding isnt an option. \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 8:21 am								 The discussion is about speed reductions on local streets (i.e. residential areas), and not arterial roads. I highly doubt that a 10km/h reduction on a local street will add a significant amount of time to your journey. Of course cyclists are getting hit, that stupid new 1mtr rule is ridiculous, you can't give a meter to a cyclist and other traffic all the time, sometimes you have to make a choice.  And if they want to make it 40k an hour around shops etc. good, but stop this nanny state shit and leave the 50k zones as they are. They can pluck all kinds of stats out of their collective arses if they want, but I don't believe dropping 50k down to 40k is going to solve anything.  All that will happen is that they will make more money on speeding tickets and spend it anywhere but the roads, as usual. Just.... no. We do not need more nanny state telling us what to do, thanks. What a knee jerk reaction. Teach pedestrians to cross the roads safely and get cyclists off the road. Give them seperate paths. Besides, more and more cars are being released with Auto brake features so this problem is going to go away by itself.\u000aI hate all this car hate that governments are coming out with. If you calculate the numbers, you'd have more chance of winning Tatts lotto 4 times over than what you have of getting run over. Shit, more people die in a week from accidents around the house than road accidents but the Gov isn't wrapping us up in bubble wrap trying to get the deaths down. Just another bunch of overpaid academics trying to justify their existence by screwing with us. Move along. Nothing to see here. You can't really use Europe as a 1:1 comparison. Most of their residential streets are significantly tighter, with barely 2 cars width and no parking space, and many have footpaths barely wide enough for one person if any at all. Cars and pedestrians are basically side by side. Hell, you see that variation even in Australia. some towns have two lane roads wide enough that they would be three lane roads in larger cities. Why bother? Most new cars have automatic braking systems anyway. Give it 10 years and this won't even be an issue. what a load of balls. kids need to to taught not to walk in front of 2ton metal projectiles. Wow. Interesting attitude. So I suppose you think if a 6 years old runs out in front of you they deserve to be hit and you continue on your merry way.\u000aYou need to hand in your license. \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 11:16 am								 Hand in their license? Last I checked empathy wasn't part of the driver training system. Are you suggesting a VK test on every L-plater?  "Tell me the good things that come into your head, about, your mother...?" Empathy has nothing to do with it. It's driving to the situation. If there is a chance that a kid might run out in front of you, then you should be driving to mitigate risk. If you can't drive to the conditions, if you can't drive defensively, then, yes you should hand in your license. And perhaps we do need an "empathy" test of some sort. Drivers who place all the blame others should hand in their license. Tailgaters are a typical example of people who should be banned from driving instantly. There is a difference between driving to conditions and forcing everyone to travel at 30-40km/h no matter what is going on the over use of ridiculous speed limits is a plague on our roads. everyone end up starring at the speedo rather than looking at what is going on around them and driving to the conditions.  also if the speed limits make no sense people stop abiding by them. It needs to be done on a case-by-case basis. The current NSW legislation is absolutely abhorrent. Current mandatory 50km/h in small, country towns, where you're lucky to see one person around, is ridiculous. Ah math... From 1999 to 2009, giving room for the slow introduction of 50km/h zones...\u000a50km/h: 15	56	56	109	143	153	160	158	152	151	166\u000a60km/h: 515	499	474	370	330	322	304	306	285	285	253\u000aTotal of those: 530	555	530	479	473	475	464	464	437	436	419\u000aTotal deaths: 1764	1817	1737	1715	1621	1583	1627	1598	1603	1437	1491 What do these numbers tell us?  Basically that the reduction in speed limits made no significant difference to the road toll over and above any other changes to the roads and cars.  Over this time period, road deaths in 50 and 60 zones remained at 28-30% of the total, obviously deaths in 50 zones went up initially due to the increase in their usage. The 15% reduction claimed in the article would suggest that this should have become a lower percentage except that the 15% claim is the overall road toll, which is not a relevant statistic when looking at a single speed limit change. 30km/h is way too fast.  20 is much safer.  That said, 10 would be safer again.  In fact, we really should have a speed limit of ZERO as that is the only safe speed.\u000aOr maybe we could just develop some sense. And where are the statistics to back it up, do the majority of injury and deaths occur at speeds below 60KMH ?, or above that ?\u000aHow will it stop a person using there phone (distracted) and walk out straight in front of a moving vehicle ?\u000aWhere is the education in schools and the general public to educate them that it is dangerous to cross a road without looking, when I was a kid at school we were taught that roads were for cars and footpaths were for pedestrians, and if you wanted to cross the road you looked to the right. looked to the left, and looked to the right again and only crossed when it was safe to do so, not to mention the Hector the Cat adds on Television about how to cross  the road safely.\u000aMaybe the Govt/s should be spending some of the hundreds of Millions of dollars they get from motorists pockets each year on actual education, how to cross the road , how to use roundabouts properly etc etc, like they used to in the good old days before the introduction of Greed Cameras.

It also includes RAW support to get professional photographers excited. On the front is an 8 megapixel \u2018selfie camera\u2019 which can be activated by hand gestures. The phone features a 5.5 inch Quantum IPS display with a high contrast ratio, helping it compete with Samsung\u2019s Super AMOLED display, despite being LCD. Android fans mourning the loss of a replaceable battery and Micro SD card slot on Samsung\u2019s latest S6 devices will be glad to see that both are retained on the G4. Abby Francis at Mobiles.co.uk adds: \u201cThe G4 is a fantastic looking and performing Android smartphone. While the unique leather-back design will get plenty of attention it shouldn\u2019t distract from the power under the hood and phone\u2019s excellent camera. Coming in slightly cheaper than Samsung\u2019s S6 and Apple\u2019s iPhone 6 the G4 will provide great competition in the high-end smartphone space.\u201d The handset will be available in black leather, brown leather and titan grey. Meanwhile the South Korean firm has also announced two more smartphones in the range. This includes a smaller variation, dubbed the G4c which ships with a 5inch display, eight megapixel rear camera and 1.2GHz processor. There\u2019s also the 5.7inch G4 Stylus, or LG G Stylo as it will be known in North America and South Korea. Although the G4 Stylus sports a larger display \u2013 albeit only 0.2inches larger \u2013 the rest of the handset is a step-down in comparison to the LG G4.   Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

p332
VThe rumours were true: Apple has ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack for the new iPhone 7. All this was done to make the iPhone one millimetre thinner. The decision is a controversial one as many iPhone users, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak himself, wanted the headphone jack to remain; no doubt a lot of people are mad right now. Here\u2019s what you need to know.  There had been a persistent rumour that Apple was removing the 3.5mm headphone jack from its upcoming iPhone, sending a load of Apple handset users into a panic. The rumour has now become a reality. iPhone 7 users will have to rely on Bluetooth headsets, Lightning-based headphones or use a Lightning to audio adaptor to listen to music or make hands-free calls. Why did Apple do this? The company believes it\u2019s time to move on from the 3.5mm headphone jack if we want to get more innovation in headphone design and improve audio quality. To Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller, who spoke at the iPhone 7 launch event in the US, getting rid of the headphone jack was an act of \u201ccourage\u201d. It\u2019s not an ideal situation for people who want to charge their phone while listening to music or a podcast (I do this a lot). That is, unless you own a Bluetooth headset and, from my own personal observations, most people don\u2019t. Those headsets aren\u2019t cheap either. At least with the 3.5mm headphone jack, you could pick up a crappy pair at a service station if you\u2019re desperate to listen to audio on your iPhone. If you\u2019re adamant in getting the iPhone 7 and you don\u2019t have a pair of Bluetooth headset, we have a few recommendations here. ...getting rid of the headphone jack was an act of \u201ccourage\u201d. More like an act of stupidity to alienate a whole lot of previously happy users. Hmm. This sounds exactly like what people were screaming about when Apple moved from 30-pin to Lightning. People need to get a grip and move on from this legacy hardware. If you really want Apple to "innovate", and cram in things like wireless charging, for example, then you should be prepared for this little roadbump. Lightning and its predecessor were Apple-specific connections.  The 3.5mm plug is a very widely used standard for audio across a huge range of devices and has been around for ages. It seems to me that 'innovate' means that Apple has trashed all the investment folks have in headphones, etc (especially if they want to charge at the same time) in the interests of making their phone *1mm* thinner (and having them locked into the Apple mystique).  When I travel long distances, I use my phone as my main source of audio entertainment.  Now it would seem those in a similar position can choose if they want to listen or recharge but not both.  Not a bright design decision IMHO. Just because it's old, doesn't mean it needs to be changed. If they made it so you could charge and use headphones (of any sort)  they'd lose a few less customers. Don't speak so fast.  We could be reading an entirely different obituary in a few months.  I like Apple products generally but I think a gentle reminder that they should always consider their customers won't hurt them. It's Official: Apple's arrogance finally caught up with them or It's Official: The 3.5mm Headphone Jack just killed off the iPhone 7 It's not just "arrogance" or stupidity by Apple, but outright bastardry!\u000aIf I would be a 'dedicated Apple customer' ... (which I am not out of conviction!), they definitely would have lost me now. Charging an 'fn' premium, and treating their customers like fools to be pushed around!  It is outrageous!\u000aIf I had been willing to pay their exorbitant prices, they would have lost me with the omission of USB socket and micro SD slot. - What is this "Lightning" bullshit cable anyway? Another proprietary connection? To hell with that! Or is it at least USB-C? Agree.  Sony pushed the proprietary bandwagon for too long... look where they are now... My partner loves the iPhone, I told him this morning that the 7 doesn't have a headphone and he asked what would he do with his expensive Sennheisers. Throw them out and use the ear buds? I told him about the adapter cable and was told "more tiny cables to lose" My partner had the same reaction. I'm not so much a Techy as a Trekkie, so could someone explain how the phone will know which way is left and right with a jack that can be used in both directions? I'm not sure how Lightning cables do it but the concept isn't as hard as you'd imagine. If it's a simple cable you can do the easy solution of just having each pin split in two so it goes ABBA, which is the same regardless of which way you plug it in. You can also do that with the important parts of the cable, then just use a software solution to determine which data goes down which line. If you have ABCDDCEF, where F is blank, C/D are power and the rest are data, the power will work and the software can then say 'ok, F is blank and there's nothing in the left socket, so F must be on the left which means A is on the right'. Thanks, I think!  :) So on long trips I can't charge from my powerbank and listen to anything on my headphones at the same time?  Surely they've considered these sorts of scenarios? Their solution: go wireless. So you can't use Apple earphones to listen to Airplane entertainment (seats have 3.5mm jacks).\u000aWorse, if you try using Apple earphones on a plane trip they won't last (5 hours quoted ) on international flights... so you need to recharge your bluetooth earbuds. The spectacle of an Apple fan wrestling with adapters & charge cables on a long haul flight will be a wet dream for Samsung advertising. I'm sure they have.. they just don't care (or in their words, they're "courageous"...) I think it's a great move. The improvements to sound quality and using a newer connection will be good.\u000aAnd for those people who say "now I can't charge my phone and listen to music at the same time". How often does that actually happen?\u000aCharge your phone only at night, while you're sleeping.\u000aOr, if you're out and about, listening to music, you can't charge your phone anyway.\u000aIf you're charging at your desk and want to listen to music, use the computer.\u000aProblem solved. Please tell me how this new connector will provide better audio quality. Apple are working on providing you with better ears... How often does that actually happen? Quite often actually. Charge your phone only at night, while you're sleeping. Not always possible. With regular usage most phone batteries will need to be charged during the day.  Or, if you're out and about, listening to music, you can't charge your phone anyway. Ever heard of a powerbank? If you're charging at your desk and want to listen to music, use the computer. I have podcasts and music on my phone. It's a pain to maintain multiple copies on both my phone, computer and laptop. And if I'm halfway through a podcast on my phone, then the same podcast will be out of sync on the computer.  Not everything is as simple as you make it out to be. Yeah, I understand what you mean. I guess my point was that not being able to charge your phone and listen to music/podcasts at the same time isn't a major issue, as there are ways around it. Sure, it's annoying to have to unplug one cable and put in another, but people will adjust. ...but people will adjust.\u000aQuite possibly, but I think the question here is *why* do they have to adjust when previously they had a solution that didn't require 'adjustment'? It's a fascinating sociological experiment. The mental gymnastics required to convince yourself this is a good idea reveal an obvious cognitive dissonance. How far can Apple push its users? I wonder what they could actually do at this point that would be a deal-breaker for slavish fans? What if you could only rent the phone? What if you had to kneel down and say three 'Hail Steves' before every call? What if you had to give blood for the priveledge? Would this be enough? Or are we too entrenched in iTunes and technically challenged to consider the OS that doesn't hold you by the short and curlys? \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 11:32 am								 Note to Apple: Why not include the 3.5mm jack while promoting digital-out via lightning and wireless audio. If it's so good everyone will switch in a gen or two and you could have taken the jack out without a big drama.  Oh wait that wouldn't work, because many people value open standards and the ability to switch between devices. Others don't want to add another battery and another thing to charge to their list of devices. Once again Apple has invented solutions for problems that don't exist. Their go to reason: courage! What a Richard move. (Full disclosure: I am somewhat butthurt right now) :p If there is a bump in the case for a camera lens, surely you can add a bump for a 3.5mm phone jack? It's just an example but my phone (Oppo R7) is 6.3mm and accommodates a 3.5mm jack just fine im all for having to adjust for new tech. But a basic function made impossible to do while doing another basic function is a 10 year leap backwards. if they had some sort of double adapter so you could do both at the same time there would not be as much written about this.

VWho the run the world? Lizards, of course. But their reign might be coming to an end, thanks to global warming.\u000a\u000aImages: Getty A new study suggests global warming is an even bigger threat to Earth\u2019s most divine creature than we previously thought. A 2010 study conducted at the University of Santa Cruz predicted 40 per cent of our precious lizard population will be dead by 2080, meaning about 20 per cent of all lizard species will go extinct. Lizards are disproportionately affected by global warming because they\u2019re cold-blooded, which means they regulate their body temperature using their external environment. The lead author of the latest study, Clemson University biologist Michael Sears, notes that the computer models in the 2010 study \u201c[assume] the lizard can find a piece of shade anywhere in the environment instantly if it needed it\u201d, which doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that \u201cit takes lizards energy and time to find shade\u201d. In Sears\u2019 study, he and his team experimented with actual lizards to figure out how lizards maintain their optimal body temperature, and also used computer modelling. The scientists investigated how the specific type of shade accessible to lizards impacted their capacity to properly regulate body temperature. Scientists lodged minuscule temperature sensors into dozens of spiny lizards \u2014 who are native to Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 and conducted controlled experiments in the New Mexico desert. Sears and his team found that lizards had a much easier time regulating their body temperature when they were able to find lots of small patches of shade, as opposed to one big patch. NPR reports: \u000aThat means predicting the future for lizards as the climate changes will be more complicated than people thought, as each population may be significantly affected by its local distribution of plants and rocky outcroppings that can provide shade.\u000a They also found that while lizards living in warm environments will likely suffer as the temperature increases, lizards living in cooler places might actually benefit from global warming. Sears explains: \u000aEverything in between, all bets are kind of off now. Because what our study suggests is that how bushes are placed in an environment might really impact the lizards just as much as the temperature itself.\u000a Now, there\u2019s an even bigger impetus to stop global warming \u2014 we gotta save the lizzies, before it\u2019s too late.

VUp to 979 Mbps on the downlink and up to 129 Mbps on the uplink \u2014 that\u2019s what speedtest.net confirms has been achieved in a User Datagram Protocol test (used for realtime applications, like voice and video over the internet) of Telstra\u2019s live LTE network.  That\u2019s an improvement of almost 200 MBps since February, and one step closer to Telstra\u2019s 1Gbps goal. On top of just-shy-of-a-gigabit download speeds, Telstra is getting close to tripling the current maximum uplink speed seen in most LTE networks globally. Increasing social sharing and video uploads is driving the need for higher uplink performance for smartphone users across the network, Telstra says, and improving uplink speeds is also important for remote and onsite workers use of enterprise cloud applications for unified communications \u2014 especially video-conferencing apps. Mike Wright, Group Managing Director Networks at Telstra says 1Gbps speeds will bring both speed and capacity outdoors, along with deeper coverage and performance indoors.

VA security expert has exposed a flaw in the Nissan companion app which lets hackers take control of the car\u2019s heating systems It\u2019s one thing your computer being hacked. But imagine if you are driving along and someone took control of your vehicle? With more and more cars connected to the internet, the risk of car hacking when someone takes control of your car remotely, as opposed to car jacking where they take it using force, looks set to grow rapidly. Last April BT announced the launch of BT Assure Ethical Hacking for Vehicles, a security service developed to test the exposure of connected vehicles. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going away, it\u2019s just getting bigger and bigger, and we need skilled people to deal with it,\u201d explains Carla Thomas, Head of People and Organisational Development in BT Security. And now according to a prominent security expert Troy Hunt a flaw with the best selling electric vehicle\u2019s Nissan\u2019s Leaf\u2019s electric vehicle\u2019s companion app means data about drivers\u2019 recent journeys could be spied on remotely. At present the breach will only allow the heating and air-conditioning systems to be hijacked. But what if the vehicle\u2019s engine was tampered with by a hacker with potentially life threatening consequences? It doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. Mr Hunt has apparently known about the breach for a little while but told the BBC he gave the firm a month to fix the issue before going public. Nissan said there was no safety threat and has still not repaired the breach. \u201cThe right thing to do at the moment would be for Nissan to turn it off altogether,\u201d Mr Hunt told the BBC. \u201cThey are going to have to let customers know. And to be honest, a fix would not be hard to do. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they have done authorisation [on the app] badly, they just haven\u2019t done it at all, which is bizarre.\u201d A spokeswoman for Nissan told the BBC it was tackling the problem. \u201cNissan is aware of a data issue relating to the NissanConnect EV app that impacts the climate control and state of charge functions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has no effect whatsoever on the vehicle\u2019s operation or safety.\u201d NissanConnect app to blame So what can Nissan owners do to protect themselves in the meantime? The first thing they should do is to disable their NissanConnect account (previously known as Nissan CarWings). Those who have never signed up are not at risk. At the root of the problem is that the firm\u2019s NissanConnect app needs only a car\u2019s vehicle identification number (Vin) to take control. The code is usually stencilled into a car\u2019s windscreen, making it relatively easy to copy. The initial characters of a Vin refer to the brand, make of car, and country of manufacture/location of the firm\u2019s headquarters. So, Mr Hunt said, it would only be the final numbers that varied between different Nissan Leafs based in the same region. \u201cNormally it\u2019s only the last five digits that differ,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to stop someone from scripting a process that goes through every 100,000 possible cars and tries and turn the air conditioning on in every one. Greater security needed with iOT According to Reiner Kappenberger, global product manager, HPE Security \u2013 Data Security, the problem lies with companies not used to security issues surrounding iOT (Internet of Things). \u201cThe situation with the Nissan Leaf, and the demonstration of how easy it is to decipher the communication between the car and the back end, is yet another demonstration on how security frequently becomes an afterthought for companies not accustomed with the broader issues surrounding the Internet of Things, or IoT. \u201cWe are lucky in this case that the attacks were only focused on functionality in the air-conditioning and heating system of the car and were done by a \u2018white hat\u2019 and not a criminally minded black hat hacker. \u201cIt is not uncommon that companies put their traditional security measures, normally deployed for their normal infrastructure, in place when creating an IoT solution and thus focus on areas like network and event logging and monitoring for their data centres. However with the explosion of new IoT environments, this is just another demonstration that this is not enough.\u201d The Nissan Leaf is the world\u2019s best selling electric vehicle having sold around 200,000 models since launch in 2010.  The US, Japan and Europe have so far accounted for 90 percent of total LEAF sales, with the US leading the way with more than 90,000 sales, followed by Japan (50,000) and Europe (40,000).

p348
VFollowing one Aussie customer reporting their Galaxy Note7 catching fire on social media, Samsung has confirmed that it has received two reports from local users of their devices being damaged by defective battery cells. Customers are being now advised of the recall through push notification to their Note7 smartphones as well as traditional methods through the phone\u2019s retailers and telco operators, with Samsung taking every step possible to make owners aware of the situation. AU Editor\u2019s Note: An important thing to note with the Note7 battery recall is that phones are not exploding. As with all lithium-ion battery incidents involving a short circuit between anode and cathode \u2014 like Samsung\u2019s situation \u2014 the cell heats up at a microscopic level. If the short circuit is significant enough, heat can cause the battery\u2019s insulation to fail and for the short circuit to reach a point called \u2018thermal runaway\u2019. While devices can catch fire from the heat, it is not an explosion; the battery industry uses the term \u2018rapid disassembly\u2019, but \u2018venting with flame\u2019 is the most appropriate explanation for the process that takes place. \u2014 Cam A Samsung spokesperson provided this statement to Gizmodo: \u201cSamsung Electronics Australia can verify two Galaxy Note7 smartphones in Australia have suffered from the reported battery cell issue. This includes an incident in Perth, WA, that was reported by a customer from Victoria.\u201d It\u2019s not yet clear whether the phones affected within Australia were sold by Australian carriers, retail stores or through Samsung directly. Each of the four stock-keeping units (SKUs) sold in Australia are unique to the local market, including carrier variants for Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and an unbranded \u2018open\u2019 model. Samsung has today used the push notification feature of the Samsung app pre-installed on all Galaxy Note7 phones to contact customers and make them aware of the situation. While there have been 51,060 Note7s already sold in Australia since Friday 19 August, the phone\u2019s $1349 price and unique feature-set means customers are more likely to be tech-savvy early adopters. The ACCC has now listed the recall on its Product Safety Australia website. Samsung is keeping its website updated with the new information, changing the entry in the \u201creported incidents\u201d section to reflect the two local battery fire issues that it is aware of. [Samsung] Credit where it's due, they're taking it seriously, acting on the incidents and being (seemingly) open and honest about the situation.\u000aWould I get horrifically downvoted if I suggested the same can't be said of Apple's approach to such issues? They would tell you it's your fault for trying to charge the battery. Really the entire industry is pretty rubbish when things aren't catching fire. Look at the number of complaints of Xperia Z screen's cracking due to being sealed in with heat. What's Sony's response? Blame the customer for breaking the screen and make the next model less waterproof. Yepp - Exaclty why the Z3 was my last Sony phone for a while. On the S7 Edge atm and happy as but when my Week Old Z3's screen snapped in half in my pocket with a case on (straight down the middle with the crack starting from the speaker hole) I knew something wasn't right with their manufacturing.. Didn't stop them from charging me $180 for a screen replacement though... (My GF uses that phone now) My brother was holding his in his hand when it got really hot and cracked right down the middle of the screen. Sony accused him of dropping it. Apparently really common if you shoot a lot of 4k video which heats the phone up significantly. Yeah I'm fairly certain they blamed me too for it snapping in my pocket - The other thing was after it happened I was so frustrated I came home and I pegged my week old phone into my pillow on my bed which I'm sure would of registered as a spike of movement if they wanted to prove I broke it. - But the actual phone was legitimately faulty from get go and they would never of excepted that :/.. consumer woes.. Do they really blackbox phones like that? His proximity sensor has gone to crap after the repair too, so screen blacks out whenever a phonecall is involved, he can't hang up. I don't think he'll be buying another Sony. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 4:14 pm								 You'd be surprised at the volume of information these things keep. Reading the fine print in the insurance policy and warranty gives you a better understanding (also boring) of it. Simple answer is yes but its a mostly automated procedure.  Ive never had issues in the past with sony phones its just they have fallen short with their   cheaper models and their new series x is so mediocre whats the point. Happy on s7 edge atm seems to be my favourite model of phone right now i think samsung has done a good job despite their note situation. I genuinely went into my last upgrade determined to buy the latest Sony. I then went into the Telstra store wearing polarised sunnies and instantly cancelled my order. It was the only premium phone in the store that had the screen blank out through polarised lenses like one of those sideways tv advertising board. All the other phones that did it were cheap awful crap. yeah dude, exploding phones aren't really something you can sweep under the carpet. Credit where it's due? Are you kidding me? They HAVE to do this or suffer the biggest class action lawsuit in tech history. They rushed a product to market to beat Apple's release and got what they deserved.  The fact Apple fans aren't in here slinging all kinds of shit says a lot. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 10:12 am								 I'm not saying they don't have to recall them. And yeah they probably could try to sweep it under the carpet if they wanted to - what's the percentage of units known to have failed again?\u000aI just think they perhaps deserve a little credit for seemingly acting responsibly when they've made a mistake. Lets wait until the Apple launch before we say they're not slinging shit, I'd be very surprised if that don't make some terrible fire related puns in their presentation. If you think a product catching fire and potential serious injury to customers is the manufacturer 'getting what they deserve', your sense of justice is seriously fucked up. no, rushing it out to one-up their competitor, which in turn causes a lack of quality control, is getting what they deserve. Just set a time of the year you launch your shit and stick to it. Like apple. So speculation on why the fault happened, absent evidence, is your justification for schadenfreude? My earlier remark stands: your sense of justice is seriously fucked up. everybody knows the release was only weeks before apple's for a reason. Your sense of logic is equally fucked up If you have evidence that the release cycle being advanced a month last year (which is where the current release schedule came from) was the cause of the fault, please do provide it. it appears obvious, no? Unless I worked there deep undercover I couldn't prove it of course. But hey..... a lot of analysts are pointing to the rushed schedule to beat apple, and it makes sense. Can you prove that it isn't? There's going to be a lot of speculation over explodegate, but nothing will ever be able to be proved unless the company itself admits to it. Like you with Bendgate. You think it was an issue with engineering problems, most others think it was a complete non-issue. You don't know for sure. Explodey phones are a little more concerning for the consumer though than slight bends.  Here's one of but a bajillion http://fortune.com/2016/09/06/samsung-apple-galaxy-note-quality/ \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 1:48 pm								 @hamish77 There's no question that the iPhone antenna and bend problems were design issues, they're both things that can (and have) been conclusively analysed by third party experts. Likewise, there's no question that the Samsung battery problem is an engineering issue, that much is evident. What's in question is whether the one month advance in the development cycle was responsible for this engineering issue, or if it was a fault that would have happened regardless of the loss of a month. My position is there isn't enough information to come to any conclusion on the cause. I think it's inappropriate to point the finger at any company, regardless of who they are, and declare they deserved their product to fail and potentially cause harm, especially when that judgemental assertion is based on speculation and not evidence. I don't know, but Apple was relatively quick (from memory) to recall and replace all those charger plugs that potentially (as some did) caught fire. It seems to me, tech companies are pretty crap when it comes to design faults, but when there's a potential law suit from injuries/death they jump on it before the courts get involved. Thursday (01/09/16) afternoon I was in discussion with Samsung over the build quality of the Note 7. Where many many people are experiencing unexplained screen cracks. At the same time we discussed the recall in South Korea that had already been taking place due to the exploding batteries. The Samsung representative over the phone was adamant there was no issue with the Australian models. This was wrong, as the AU models are identical to the SK model, other than the stickers in English not Korean. Because they were in defence mode, they would not admit anything, however I did pursue the issue and they gave me a case number. Basically, Samsung was SLOW on the announcement, they knew of the issue days before and kept it secret. Samsung DID NOT do the right thing. In other points, Samsung had halted the distribution of the Note 7, days before even the alarm and recall in South Korea. So it is likely they knew full well that the screens glass was less than acceptable. Corning even said that their glass meets spec IF and only IF the company using it doesn't screw with it. E.g. Bend the glass to curve either side... It will be interesting, as to what will have changed in the new and improved Note 7 (7.5?) Another question is, what will be the new Note 7's battery capacity? Will it remain the same? That would be unlikely, so will we get more or less mAh? Another rumour was that China was to get a 6GB ram, 128GB storage model. Perhaps we will get a better phone? Who knows. I can say for certain that this isn't related to the phone's glass. I think your timeline is off, too, because the Korean recall wasn't announced until 6PM 2/9 Australian time. Sales were halted in Korea and then worldwide around 12 hours beforehand.  You'll get back an (brand new, not refurbished)  identical Note7 with the same glass and a replaced battery - no extra mAh, no 6GB RAM, no 128GB storage.  The phone's glass is fine, although you're (I think?) clearly not happy that Gorilla Glass 5 is more smash resistant at the cost of being less scratch resistant. Corning has been building glass with curved applications for a while now on a variety of phones. I think you're underestimating the task of organising a global recall with all major networks, retailers, support desks, languages, logistics etc being given, and adhering to, common information and policies.\u000aComplaining that it took a few days to put in place? Really? I'd applaud them for such an effort. I just saw on my note7 (australian) that it's made in vietnam, the korean ones are made locally. Rapid disassembly, seriously? Sounds ridiculous, right? But it's a technical term. Honestly. A term favoured by rocket engineers and most notably, Elon Musk In the automotive industry it was called a "Thermal Incident" If this was Apple - oh the humanity! But it just Samsung, nothing to get upset about. Well that's the jist I'm getting, they are the underdog so it ok if they f8ckup occasionally. Sure Apple committed worse crimes and the world fell apart temporarily when they did (OMG, bend-gate, antenna-gate, err yes we are that pathetic those things caused mass hysteria). But Samsung? Yeah thats ok they are doing the right thing by recalling EXPLODING phones, like seriously - this is bad stuff! Anyway, Samsung - the Jeep of the phone world. Mate. Relax your slacks. Apple copped flak for the iPhone 4's antenna, the iPhone 6's bending, and most recently the charger recall. And now Samsung is copping flak for the Note7's battery, it's no different.  Actually I think the point he is making is that Apple coped more flack for the iPhone 6 bending and the iPhone 4 antenna signal issues versus the amount of flack that Samsung is copping at the moment for an issue that causes both property and physical damage to some of the owners affected by the issue. Apple is held to a higher standard and I don't think Apple really has a problem with that. So it's no surprise that they will deal with more of a backlash than competing manufacturers.  To say that a phone bending when you place excessive force on it is "no different" than a phone "Venting Flames" is a bit ridiculous though. This isn't an issue where Samsung should be coping flak for a supposed design flaw that could have been a little different. This is Samsung copping flake for selling a dangerous product that could cause serious injury or even death. Many people charge their phones at night while sleeping and this phone has the potential to start a house fire. It's not about Samsung handling the recall well and giving them kudos for it. This is something that should not have happened to begin with. Samsung isn't selling some cheap low end phone here. They are charging a premium for something that shouldn't even be on the store shelf. And they have a track record of selling dangerous devices including washing machines and TV's that have caught fire in the past so they really should know better by now. But sure: "it's no different" Oh come on, man. "They have a track record of selling dangerous devices"? Come on. I'm sorry, but that's a rather childish response. I'm not just posting ridiculous theories to be part of some message board debate or something. If you had doubts about my comment a more civilised  and professional response would be to ask me for evidence to back up my claim. Also I find it concerning that you work in the media and report on stories like this but have no historical knowledge of such events. I'm not sure why you seem to be so intent on defending Samsung because Instead of acknowledging that a phone catching fire is not at all the same thing as a phone bending under excessive force you just tried to question the one thing in my reply you didn't believe.  Do you actually think it's acceptable for a corporation to sell a device that has the potential to catch fire while you are asleep? Yes Samsung has recalled the device and appears to be doing a better job of this recall than they have in the past with dangerous products like their faulty washing machines, but this phone shouldn't have been released with a flaw like this to begin with. As you seem to be a reporter that struggles to do any actual research I've done some for you. But there's plenty more online if you would like to pretend to be a real reporter... Here's a story on the Samsung washing machines that have caused house fires:\u000ahttp://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/hometech/samsung-washing-machines-two-more-sydney-homes-catch-fire-20150522-gh79vr.html And here's the product recall on Samsung's website that confirms there are still (in Samsung's own words): "still thousands of affected machines that are yet to be serviced or otherwise retrieved"\u000ahttp://www.samsung.com/au/washingmachinerecall/ Here's a story on reports of Samsung TV's catching fire:\u000ahttp://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/hdtvs-are-catching-fire-literally-f123020 And here's a report on the S4 catching fire when plugged in:\u000ahttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mans-samsung-galaxy-s4-catches-6089025 And before you come back with some lame response again I'm not trying to imply that "all Samsung devices catch fire" or that "This is why everyone should by Microsoft/Nokia/Apple/Blackberry phones".  The only point I'm trying to make is that it shouldn't be considered acceptable for Samsung to stuff up like this. This isn't just a flaw that will impact how long your phone will last without being damaged, it's a flaw that has serious safety implications for it's users.  Yes I agree that the whole "my phone company is better than your phone company" can become a ridiculous argument but defending Samsung as if this is no big deal is rather unprofessional. Your argument hinges on you (for some reason) thinking that I'm letting Samsung off lightly. You should go look at how many posts I've written about this. You should go look at the fact that I wrote about this before Samsung had even announced it or confirmed it. If you think I'm defending Samsung "as if this is no big deal", then you need to step back and take a look at the work we've done to bring this to light in Australia in the first place. Not directed at you Campbell but there seems to be a lot of "sympathy" for Samsung. The response would be much worse had this been an Apple device.  The new apple device is not even announced and the giz comment sections on the topic is filled with Apple hate, but its "good on Samsung for doing the right thing" over here. Can I coin the term "Explodegate" then? You guys need to decide whether we apparently hate Apple or Samsung more, because this is back to the good old days where the comments section would be equal measures of "you fucking Apple shill" and "you love Android so much". It's confusing, I don't know who to ask for my illicit underhanded payments from. September 7, 2016 12:42 pm Author\u000aYour argument hinges on you (for some reason) thinking that I'm letting Samsung off lightly. The reason was that you stated in your own comments that issues with a phones antenna or being bent when excessive force was "no different" than a phone catching fire.  Also kudos to you for writing about this story before Samsung had time to officially investigate and announce a product recall. You must be very efficient. I mean if you can read about something online and make a couple of phone calls faster than Samsung can gauge how widespread the issue is or if it's just a few isolated cases due to improper use then you deserve to be commended.  The fact that you would write about a technology story on a tech blog that is bound to be a popular story shows that you are obviously unbiased regardless of what you say in the comments. How could I not have realised that.  And you're right, I really "need to step back and take a look at the work we've done to bring this to light in Australia in the first place." /s\u000aDo you really expect that your readers should study all of your articles before replying to one of your comments? Or are you just trying innovative new ways to increase your click traffic? Also, why is it that you refuse to actually address any of the points I've made? Each time you reply you avoid the question or try and deflect it. You posted a very childish response when I brought up the fact that Samsung have had issues with products catching fire in the past and when I provided evidence of this you just ignored it. I'll try and make it simpler for you. You could even respond with a yes no answer if that's easier.  1. Do you really believe that "it's no different" (your words) for a phone to bend under excessive force or lose signal bars when gripped a particular way than it is for a phone to catch fire while you sleep?  2. Do you not believe that Samsung has had products in the past that catch fire and have caused considerable damage including destroying entire homes? You're arguing with the wrong person, mate. Go back to your original comment, the one where you ridiculed the idea of Samsung's recall being a good thing, and have a serious think about the line of argument you're taking. It's about ethics in fire related smart phone articles? Did you read the articles you linked? The washing machine issue was the only actual safety issue, the two others don't support your argument. The article on televisions doesn't mention a single Samsung product catching fire, but you described it as "reports of Samsung TVs catching fire". If you read the article you find the only two mentions of Samsung televisions are a complaint where one makes noises when it's switched off, and another with an intermittent on/off toggle issue. Neither are safety hazards, let alone what you claimed. The third article you linked on an S4 catching fire is no different to the hundreds of articles you can find on the iPhone doing the same thing (for example, this one), or really any other rechargeable device. There's no indication the S4 was any more fire-prone than its competitors. What you describe as a 'track record of selling dangerous devices' seems to only describe two recalls, the current one included. Apple also have a dangerous product recall this year with their AC adapter fire risk, so I'm not clear what you think makes Samsung significantly worse than Apple in this respect. I never said Samsung makes worse products than Apple. I said that comparing a bending phone or signal lose from an antenna design should not be considered "no different" than a phone catching fire.  Also in relation to the charger recall (which I never cited in my comments) this is something that is in a different category to a bending phone or signal lose and does deserve to be treated differently which is obviously why Apple issued a recall for the charges but didn't do so for the iPhone 4 or 6. There were no reports that I have seen of fires being started from the iPhone charges that have been recalled but if there were then Apple deserves to be held accountable for that.  You also left out some key details in the article you linked to about the iPhone 5:\u000a"Jonathan Fuguet, of Bureau Veritas Laboratories, who was employed to investigate by Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service, confirmed the overheating of the iPhone battery had caused the fire because the device was on the bed covers and the heat was unable to circulate freely. " It wasn't due to a faulty battery that the phone caught fire. Having said that though most people would not consider that having the phone on bed covers or under a pillow or anything like that would result in a fire. Especially with some apps that measure your sleep advising to actually put the phone under you sheets. This is something that should really be addressed. I  have heard in the past that iPhones and presumable other smartphones shut off if they get too hot, not sure if they can stop charging though if they are plugged in. Also in relation to the story about the S4 that you said didn't show it as being any more fire prone than it's competitors. In the article it states:\u000aHe added: "I am very annoyed at Samsung as at the time I though it was just my phone.\u000a"I have now found out this is a big problem with this handsets.\u000a"When I spoke to them over the phone, they acted like this was a one off but since then I have looked on social media and saw others with the same problem. Of course when they site 'Social Media' as the source it might not be very reliable. The issue here though isn't about which company is worse than the other. It's about lumping issues that can cause physical harm or damage the property of their users in with issues that just make the phone less reliable. The initial comment that the author responded with in relation to comparing signal lose and bending phones with a phone catching fire stated that "It's no different" and that is what I have issue with. It's very different. And the additional articles you provided, especially the one about the man dying in bed, show that this is a very different issues. It's all good and well to say that these should have never been sold in the first place, but that could be applied to every other product recall in history, they say that hindsight is a wonderful thing. If they had known about this prior to releasing the phone I am sure they never would have made them available for sale in the first place. With under 50 reported case and over 1,000.000 devices sold the fault rate is less than 0.01% so there is no way they could determined this prior to sale. Second to this the fault lies in the battery circuity and only impacts the batteries for 1 specific supplier again making it harder to identify in quality assurance tests.    The point is that companies make mistakes where sometimes serious design issues/flaws don't get identified through quality assurance testing and end up being sold to customers. Samsung has acted quite quickly in regards that they started investigating the issues and ceased sales once 0.003% of devices were reported, then once they identified the root cause of the issue they issued the world wide device recall for all handsets. In reality they probably didn't need to do this, they could have identified the specific batteries impacted and only recalled those devices, they could have waited until a larger proportion of devices failed, or they could have simply pretended that it wasn't an issue at all. And to say that they have a track record of selling dangerous devices is simply not accurate. Based on the total number of consumer electronic devices, brown/white goods that Samsung sell world wide they probably have one of the best safety records. In the past 10 years there appear to have only been 3 Samsung product recalls being the Note7, The washing machine and a specific TV Stand. Compared to Apple x 2, Microsoft x 2, Panasonic x 2, LG x 6, Sony x 6. Um...he/she has extremely valid points. Also, as you only responded to one small piece of his the post - YES, several of their electronics have been up for recall due to fire hazard in the last few years. Apple copped flak for the antenna and bending issues because they tried to deny they were problems in the first place, shifting blame onto the customers. Samsung has taken responsibility for the problem from the start here, so if you're seeing a difference in reaction, that would be why. bendgate wasn't a problem. My caseless iphone 6 is two years old and lived it's entire life thus far in my front left pants pocket. No bends.  Some douche in the world puts it in his back pocket of his tight jeans and sits on it. Get a brain. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 12:20 pm								 "It didn't affect me so it's not a problem" is invalid logic. it didn't affect 99.9% of the people out there. If phones were bending all over the show, there would've been a furore of immeasurable proportions......instead, it was a fart in a spa bath. Unnoticed The Samsung issue doesn't affect 99.9% of people out there either, nor are batteries exploding "all over the show". A bent phone is 99.9% chance of inconvenience... an 99.9% exploding phone could cause a few deaths. There's a slight difference between phones bending and phones exploding. One or two phones bend under extreme back pocket pressure from some skinny jean wearing douches will not burn your entire house down. Essentially, one deserves a full recall and the other deserves nothing. The samsung love is strong with this one. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 1:20 pm								 Argumentum ergo decedo. Just because I disagree with you doesn't mean I love the thing you're arguing against, and even if I did it wouldn't invalidate the argument. Be careful with the all inclusive word "we". Most people including me don't give a fuck about this issue or Apple's product flaws. Mistakes happen, and it's just a phone. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 7:40 am								 Oh Apple, if you don't capitalize on this colossal mess at your Keynote tomorrow.... I bet there's a sly swipe or two said onstage.  The fact Applefans aren't absolutely inundating all boards with "haha's" says a lot. I'm actually surprised at how reserved most are. Imagine it the other way around? After bendgate, I don't need to imagine. (Got two year old iPhone 6, no case....no bends) - Pathetic really the whole 'war' nonsense. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 10:11 am								 Why are you even mentioning Apple in this article? Let alone hoping that they'll poke fun at the misfortune of others. It's very hypocritical to decry the 'pathetic war nonsense' when you seem to be an active participant yourself. no, I'm keen to see if they do bite. They usually don't but will this be too good an opportunity to miss for them? Considering samsung take swipes all the time? Can't wait to find out. I also have the S6 work phone along with my personal iphone and they're both great phones. I mentioned apple because this is the eve of their keynote on their new competing phone. Personally though, I'll be impressed if they don't even mention it and now think they probably wont. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 12:16 pm								 What ever the cost of this recall, and who ever ends up paying for it, you could have reduced the dollar value by 80% if the battery was still user replaceable. Yes I know, the phone would not have been water resistant, but, mailing out new replacement  batteries is simpler, a quicker fix and doesn't involve hundreds of thousands (millions?), of phones requiring refurbishment. So when will a less fire prone one be available? Any guesses? My note 2 is barely hanging on. @campbellsimpson\u000aSeptember 7, 2016 1:41 pm Author\u000aYou guys need to decide whether we apparently hate Apple or Samsung more, because this is back to the good old days where the comments section would be equal measures of "you fucking Apple shill" and "you love Android so much". It's confusing, I don't know who to ask for my illicit underhanded payments from. Obviously anyone who is pro Samsung is going to say you hate Samsung if you post something that is in the least bit positive towards Apple and vice versa for a pro Apple fan. There is no chance that you could get s mix of people who are pro Apple or pro Samsung to agree on something like that.  But really it shouldn't matter to you if someone is accusing you of being pro one manufacturer or another. Although I'm sure it helps your click traffic to have people battling this out so I'm not sure why you would be complaining? Is love for Samsung vs Apple the Holden vs Ford rivalry for the millenial generation? Yes I think it is. Although without an event like Bathurst in the phone world it's not really as interesting... The common factor is inbreeding on both sides. Everyone else's biases are dumb! Some of my comments were removed from this story and I believe it's purely because it made the author look bad for being called out on his comments and did not at all violate the community guidelines.  I'm all for ensuring that there are no hatful messages directed at individuals or groups. I also don't think people should be posting obvious troll comments but I did neither of these things. The author posted a  comment that I then questioned. Rather than responding to my question he tried to insult me by questing my comment in a childish manner. When I responded to his statement with evidence he ignored this and again deflected the question. Even when other commenters called him on this he still deflected the question.  When I specifically called him on deflecting questions and addressed his comment of "Your arguing with the wrong person mate" my comment was removed. This seems to have been a threat to say that if I argued with him my comments would be removed which is what happened.  I'm sure this will be deleted or not approved but at least now I know Gizmodo isn't a place you can have an actual open discussion with the authors so I doubt I'll bother coming back again. I've been watching this thread all day. None of your posts seem to be missing, that I can see (edit: sorry, one post seems to be missing, but you were playing the man instead of the argument in it from memory). Campbell never insulted you, but you certainly insulted him with your disparaging personal attacks on his competency as a reporter. Ad hominems are no way to present your argument if you want to be taken seriously. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 4:41 pm								 Samsung phones just went down to Chinese quality lol

The starting price for the 32GB iPhone 7 is $68 per month on a $40 My Plan Plus, which includes 1GB of data, unlimited national calls and national text messages. The starting price for the 32GB iPhone 7 Plus is $75 per month on the same $40 My Plan Plus. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll pay on Optus\u2019 plans \u2014 including the monthly handset repayment which varies for different storage capacities of both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, for a total monthly cost: Give our charts below a moment to load\u2026       Their useless website is also sold out of most of the 128/256gb plus models In fairness Apple are saying most of the phones are unavailable till November Let alone the fact that they aren't shipping til the 29th. My order failed 3 separate times after clicking the final preorder button. And now they're sold out.\u000aThey're also not offering the jet black one at all.\u000aTelstra on the other hand, I can still order a 256gb Jet Black Plus and get it next week. While Telstra traditionally gets allocated the most handsets by Apple they are not showing their delivery times on their website. When I did my pre order at 5:01 over the phone I was told they have an estimate of stock but that things can and usually do change.\u000aGiven how popular the black units have been outright from Apple don't hold Your breath for a next week delivery

p352
VResearchers at the University of California San Diego have taken a significant step forward in the effort to develop a vaccine against the bacteria responsible for strep throat, toxic shock syndrome and flesh-eating disease.\u000a`\u000aStreptococcus pyogenes bacteria. (Image: CDC) Group A Streptococcus, or group A strep, are nasty breed of bacteria that can cause an assortment of infections. Most group A strep infections are relatively mild, such as strep throat and the impetigo skin infection, but occasionally these bacteria go on to cause more serious and even life threatening conditions, such as toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, or \u201cflesh-eating disease\u201d. According to the CDC, around 500,000 people die each year from this bacteria, prompting researchers to find novel ways of staving off these dreaded germs. In a new study published in Nature Microbiology, a group of researchers from the University of California San Diego have detected previously unseen patterns in the outer protein coat of group A strep. These hidden sequence patterns, called the M protein, limit the body\u2019s immune response against these bacteria. It\u2019s an important piece of insight that shows why the human body is so vulnerable to this bacteria \u2014 and how we might be able to develop a vaccine to compensate. \u201cWhen we become infected with a particular strain of group A Strep, we generally mount an immune response against the particular M protein displayed by that strain,\u201d explained lead researcher Partho Ghosh in a statement. \u201cBut this immunity works only against the infecting strain.\u201d Ghosh says the bacteria mounts a disguise, leaving us vulnerable to infection by other group A strep strains with other types of M proteins. \u201cThis is because the antibody response against the M protein is almost always specific to the sequence of that M protein, and M proteins of different types appear to be unrelated in sequence to one another,\u201d Gosh said. Insidiously, strep A bacteria uses our own body against us, recruiting a human protein called C4BP which tricks the body into calling off an immune response. But practically all M proteins can bind to C4BP, so if the researchers can develop an antibody that does the same thing, they will have found a way to destroy the otherwise invisible bacteria. To see if this is indeed possible, the researchers conducted an experimental computational study. The biochemists recreated four crystal structures of four different M proteins \u2014 and like lego blocks, each of these structures attached themselves to human C4BP. \u201cThe idea now is to have antibodies do the same thing as C4BP \u2014 that is, recognise many different M protein types,\u201d said Ghosh. Assuming this can be done, the researchers will engineer an antibody response that\u2019s not limited to one M protein and one strain of group A strep. And in fact, it could extend to practically all M protein types and strains of group A strep. It may be years, if ever, before we see this vaccine reach the market. Until then, we can do some practical things to help prevent group A infections. The CDC recommends hand washing, especially after coughing and sneezing, and before preparing foods or eating. People with sore throats should visit their doctor, and if the tests reveal strep, they should stay home from school or work at least 24 hours after starting antibiotics. As for wounds, they should be kept immaculately clean and observed for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, drainage and pain. Should any of these signs appear, it\u2019s advised that you see a doctor immediately. [Nature Microbiology] I had Necrotising Fasciitis 6 years ago -one of the deadliest flesh eating bacteria out there. A vaccine back then would've been wonderful because it would've meant I didn't lose over 5% of my flesh, suffer nerve damage & have to spend over 8 weeks in hospital for 14 different surgeries. Not to mention almost get strep from having a main line valve left in too long. The only problem with treating this is when your doctor cross infects you from another patient and Writes cancer on your medical chart undermining all future medical care and your ability to get a second opinion. That's pretty fucked, yeah.

VA series of beautiful digital terrain maps, created by the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), are immortalizing something that might soon be lost: the magnificent, ice-carved landscapes of the Arctic.  Mount Aniakchak, a volcanic caldera located in Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Range. All images: NSF/NGA These recently unveiled topographic maps of Alaska are the first publicly-released products from the ArcticDEM project, a White House-mandated initiative to help Arctic communities prepare for climate change. Based on 2-meter resolution images captured by commercial satellites and fed into a supercomputer at the University of Illinois, the maps show Alaska\u2019s rugged mountains, volcanic calderas, winding rivers, and glaciers in greater detail than ever before. Kodiak Benny Benson State Airport, located a few miles south of Kodiak, Alaska.\u000aThe timing couldn\u2019t be better. The Arctic is coming off an absolutely sweltering summer in what will likely go down as the hottest year in recorded history. Sea ice is retreating at an alarming rate, turning the fabled northwest passage into a reality. Permafrost is collapsing into the ocean along Alaska\u2019s north slopes, forcing entire communities to pick up and move. Out-of-control megafires are erasing ecosystems overnight. Side-by-side comparison of elevation maps of Anchorage produced with current datasets (left) and the newly available topographic data (right).\u000aClimate change is reshaping landscapes and life here like nowhere else on Earth, but our ability to prepare for the future has been hindered by a lack of reliable topographic data. While most of the United States has been mapped down to a resolution of a single meter, vast swaths of the Arctic have never been mapped at a resolution below 30 meters. And that matters a lot from a planning perspective. Per a White House blog post: \u000aBetter elevation maps can be used to quantify changes in sea level and monitor coastal erosion in order to identify buildings and critical infrastructure at high risk of storm-surge damage, and to identify safe places to shelter when storms come\u2026.The ArcticDEMs are the benchmark against which future landscape-level changes due to, for instance, erosion, extreme events, or climate change can be measured. Satellite imagery can be collected and DEMs produced at regular intervals \u2014 weekly, monthly, or annually \u2014 to observe and document changes as they occur.\u000a Digital terrain models of the entire Arctic north of 60 degrees latitude are expected to be released in 2017. For now, you can prospect land for your future Alaskan summer home on the ArcticDEM\u2019s public portal, or just enjoy some stunning Earth porn right here.

VQuora is a fun platform for interesting questions and answers. If you\u2019ve never used it, basically imagine Reddit but where all of the questions are almost exclusively about how aeroplanes work, why President Obama is great, and how to be as successful as a technology billionaire.  This falls into the latter. One user asked \u201cHow can I be as great as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Richard Branson?\u201d and got a response from none-other than Elon Musk\u2019s wife. Well, his EX wife, Justine Musk. Sadly, her response isn\u2019t as bitter and angry as we were hoping, but it is worth repeating in full, as it makes for interesting reading: \u201cExtreme success results from an extreme personality and comes at the cost of many other things. Extreme success is different from what I suppose you could just consider \u2018success\u2019, so know that you don\u2019t have to be Richard or Elon to be affluent and accomplished and maintain a great lifestyle. Your odds of happiness are better that way. But if you\u2019re extreme, you must be what you are, which means that happiness is more or less beside the point. These people tend to be freaks and misfits who were forced to experience the world in an unusually challenging way. They developed strategies to survive, and as they grow older they find ways to apply these strategies to other things, and create for themselves a distinct and powerful advantage. They don\u2019t think the way other people think. They see things from angles that unlock new ideas and insights. Other people consider them to be somewhat insane. \u201cBe obsessed. \u201cBe obsessed. \u201cBe obsessed. \u201cIf you\u2019re not obsessed, then stop what you\u2019re doing and find whatever does obsess you. It helps to have an ego, but you must be in service to something bigger if you are to inspire the people you need to help you (and make no mistake, you will need them). That \u2018something bigger\u2019 prevents you from going off into the ether when people flock round you and tell you how fabulous you are when you aren\u2019t and how great your stuff is when it isn\u2019t. Don\u2019t pursue something because you \u201cwant to be great\u201d. Pursue something because it fascinates you, because the pursuit itself engages and compels you. Extreme people combine brilliance and talent with an *insane* work ethic, so if the work itself doesn\u2019t drive you, you will burn out or fall by the wayside or your extreme competitors will crush you and make you cry. \u201cFollow your obsessions until a problem starts to emerge, a big meaty challenging problem that impacts as many people as possible, that you feel hellbent to solve or die trying. It might take years to find that problem, because you have to explore different bodies of knowledge, collect the dots and then connect and complete them. \u201cIt helps to have superhuman energy and stamina. If you are not blessed with godlike genetics, then make it a point to get into the best shape possible. There will be jet lag, mental fatigue, bouts of hard partying, loneliness, pointless meetings, major setbacks, family drama, issues with the Significant Other you rarely see, dark nights of the soul, people who bore and annoy you, little sleep, less sleep than that. Keep your body sharp to keep your mind sharp. It pays off. \u201cLearn to handle a level of stress that would break most people. \u201cDon\u2019t follow a pre-existing path, and don\u2019t look to imitate your role models. There is no \u201cnext step\u201d. Extreme success is not like other kinds of success; what has worked for someone else, probably won\u2019t work for you. They are individuals with bold points of view who exploit their very particular set of unique and particular strengths. They are unconventional, and one reason they become the entrepreneurs they become is because they can\u2019t or don\u2019t or won\u2019t fit into the structures and routines of corporate life. They are dyslexic, they are autistic, they have ADD, they are square pegs in round holes, they piss people off, get into arguments, rock the boat, laugh in the face of paperwork. But they transform weaknesses in ways that create added advantage \u2014 the strategies I mentioned earlier \u2014 and seek partnerships with people who excel in the areas where they have no talent whatsoever. \u201cThey do not fear failure \u2014 or they do, but they move ahead anyway. They will experience heroic, spectacular, humiliating, very public failure but find a way to reframe until it isn\u2019t failure at all. When they fail in ways that other people won\u2019t, they learn things that other people don\u2019t and never will. They have incredible grit and resilience. \u201cThey are unlikely to be reading stuff like this. (This is *not* to slam or criticize people who do; I love to read this stuff myself.) They are more likely to go straight to a book: perhaps a biography of Alexander the Great or Catherine the Great* or someone else they consider Great. Surfing the \u2018Net is a deadly timesuck, and given what they know their time is worth \u2014 even back in the day when technically it was not worth that \u2014 they can\u2019t afford it. \u201cI could go on, it\u2019s a fascinating subject, but you get the idea. I wish you luck and strength and perhaps a stiff drink should you need it.\u201d So stop slacking, and get working. James is the Editor of TechDigest. You can follow him on Twitter @Psythor.

VIf rumours are true, Sony Pictures may have backed up the proverbial dump truck of cash to Daniel Craig\u2019s house. According to Radar Online, the company has offered the actor $US150 million ($197.7 million) to play James Bond two more times.\u000a\u000aNow, Radar Online isn\u2019t exactly The New York Times, so consider this a rumour. But there are certainly plenty of hints of at least the idea of Sony wanting Craig back to be true. Since the release of 2015\u2019s Spectre, there hasn\u2019t been any public acknowledgement of the future of the James Bond franchise, although of course we know it will continue in some fashion. We\u2019ve heard rumours of actors like Tom Hiddleston potentially taking over the role, and we know Sam Mendes, who helmed the last two, won\u2019t be back. Craig has proven to be a fan-favourite, though, and rumours around Hollywood have been swirling that the reason for the delay isn\u2019t that producers were looking for a new Bond, but that they have been trying to convince the current one. According to Radar\u2019s source, \u201cDaniel\u2019s the key for a seamless, safe transition as far as Sony and Bond bosses are concerned, and they\u2019re prepared to pay a king\u2019s ransom to make it happen.\u201d You could certainly ransom a couple of kings with $197 million. But is it enough to get Craig back as Bond? [Radar via Indiewire] Having recently binged through all of the Bonds, Craig is by far my favourite. The story telling, the character - much darker, less slapstick. This all sounds hauntingly familiar... Oh that's right - it's because we've been here before with Sean Connery post-You Only Live Twice. They paid him almost $1.25 million USD back in 1971 to play Bond again (the equivalent of $7.5 million USD today) and what we got was Diamonds are Forever - arguably Connery's worst Bond film (although that's debatable as far as Never Say Never Again is concerned). Craig has made it pretty clear that he hates the character and wants nothing more to do with it. It seems stupid to me to essentially beg him to come back. At best you'll get a performance that is either bored or disinterested, and at worst outright bad. Connery played the entirety of Diamonds are Forever sarcastically, so Bond comes across as an aloof wisearse in that film. Compare that to his performances in Dr. No and From Russia with Love and his appearance in DaF is laughably bad. Yeah this is what I was thinking! He said he would rather slit his wrists than play bond again, maybe they should look for someone who wants the job! Shame spectre was utter trash. Skyfall set the bar very high. Definitely Craig's best. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 10:58 am								 Craig is more brawl than class, time for change I'll do it for half as much. Craig has the charisma of a dead fish. Plenty of people they could replace him with, Ewan Mcgregor, Michael Fassbender or Tom Hiddleston. clive owen or christopher eccelston please. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 7:43 pm								 Craig is awesome and I really want to see more of him in the Bond films. The films before him were somewhat tacky and I see Craig portraying a completely different bond in his films with a complex, unsettled and fuller personality that leaves one wanting to discover and turn the next page as one would read a novel. It is interesting. that he really hates the character and doesn't want to play bond at all. I just don't get it. what happens when an actor portrays a villain or any other character with questionable traits, does he just want to play the good guy? be in movies only like "the vow"? it's a popular storyline and he brings out  bond so well. Having said all that, Fassbender could possibly be a great replacement and I see him leading this really well. can we just decide already?

VOn Wednesday, the Senate\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations announced it was launching a probe into the pricing of Mylan\u2019s EpiPen, the life-saving allergy treatment device which cost about $US57 ($74) in 2007 and is priced at around $US600 ($782) today. \u000aLead Image: AP AU Editor\u2019s Note: In Australia the EpiPen is subsidised and usually under $100 even at full price. While the situation is not relevant to Australian EpiPen users, we\u2019re continuing to cover this story as it unfolds.  \u201cOur review of this matter will be robust, thorough, and bipartisan,\u201d said the panel in a statement. \u201cRepublican and Democrat Parents and school districts in Ohio, Missouri and across the country need affordable access to this life-saving drug, and we share their concern over Mylan\u2019s sustained price increases.\u201d The committee described the probe as a \u201cpreliminary inquiry\u201d and said it would focus on \u201cMylan Pharmaceuticals\u2019 pricing and competition practices with respect to the EpiPen.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s announcement is just the latest headache for the pharmaceutical company since the price changes began receiving mainstream press coverage last month. In August, the Congressional House Oversight Committee sent Mylan a letter requesting a wide range of financial information and internal documents relating to their \u201cvirtual monopoly\u201d on the product. And just yesterday, New York\u2019s Attorney General promised to hold the company accountable if they \u201cengaged in anti-competitive business practices or violated antitrust laws.\u201d [Reuters] In Australia the EpiPen is subsidised\u000aTrue, but out of curiosity, if there are any MDs out there that know about the medical subsidy program, does the Australian importer still have to pay that full price of $782, before they are subsidised by the government? For serious cases you can get a Medical Authority (Ask your doctor)  and it gets subsidized  by the PBS so you might pay somewhere between 5.20 and 38.30 depending on concessions,  and no single pack epipens do not cost any near $782 even at your local pharmacy, at around $100 over the counter that is an un- subsidized price. Should start a business of selling AU Epipens to the US for around $650 and undercut them.  Similar to the Chinese buying baby formula and other AU items and re-selling them at hugely inflated prices. The US senate controlled by the Republicans, So really nothing will change, They will feign interest but do nothing because the company that owns Epi-pen will have donated heavily to republican seantors Amazing how Obamacare has blown prices sky high. All this government intervention is screwing it up even more. The idea of Obamacare was fine but then the US is so greedy with people qualifying if they work full-time 30 hours minimum a week so employers would cut them back to part-time at 29 hours. They(employees) have very little protections which makes these things hard to work. So you dont use medicare then? Yeah US hospitals are so awesome, Going in to get a broken arm fixed and coming out with a $10k bill is so awesome! Emergency rooms demanding credit cards before treating is spectacular! Obama care didnt blow prices sky high. Companies did that themselves. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 2:14 pm

VWhile there are dozens of phones which run their own flavour of Android operating system, Nexus phones are the purest expressions of Google\u2019s ideas. Google is preparing to launch a pair of new Nexus phones this spring, and thanks to rumours and leaks we\u2019ve already got a good idea of what they will look like.\u000a\u000aImage: Nexus 6p Here\u2019s everything we think we know (so far). A truism for smartphones nowadays is that flagships come in twos. Samsung did this with the S7, Apple does it with the iPhone and Google did it with its phones last year. It\u2019s likely to repeat the formula again by introducing one big phone and one small phone. The two phones are reportedly codenamed \u201cSailfish\u201d and \u201cMarlin\u201d, which is in-step with Google\u2019s fish-centric naming convention for Nexus phones. Last year\u2019s Nexus 6P was codenamed \u201cAngler\u201d, for instance. However, these phones\u2019 official names are much less certain. With evidence that Google is dropping the \u201cNexus\u201d branding on the phone itself, who knows if it will even be called a Nexus. Image: Android Police According to Android Police, the twin Nexus devices will be built exclusively by HTC, which seems to be confirmed by FCC filings. The nearly always correct Evan Blass, AKA @evleaks, also confirmed the rumour. HTC is building a pair of Android N devices for Google internally dubbed M1 and S1 #nexus \u2014 Evan Blass (@evleaks) April 27, 2016  Android Police also says that the two devices will both be metal and will have very few differences between them besides size. But some bloggers have compared the leaked images above to this year\u2019s HTC 10, saying the hardware looks recycled. The bezel does look uncommonly big as if it is missing some hardware. However, the phone shows visible differences in several other areas. Once you flip to the back, you\u2019re left with something very not HTC \u2014 a giant glass panel which will likely house the camera and fingerprint sensor. Image: Android Police (not a press render) Another leak that reportedly shows the smaller Sailfish seems to support the existence of that back glass panel. The 2016 HTC Nexus looks like a cross between the Nexus 4 & iPhone with glass and fingerprint scanner on the back. pic.twitter.com/7pm9fhszki \u2014 nexus (@usbfl) August 14, 2016  So it looks like the Nexus could come with that interesting back panel design. As for colours, right now it\u2019s looking like black, white and \u201celectric blue\u201d. All rumours need to be taken with a grain of salt, but the specs for the smaller of these Nexus phones has been convincingly leaked and exhaustively reported by Android Police. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re supposedly looking at: According to leaks, the only difference between the small Nexus and its bigger brother is a higher resolution Quad HD display, a bigger 3450 mAh battery and, obviously, a larger 5.5-inch display. Android Nougat isn\u2019t much of a secret any more since Google launched the software back in March. However, Google looks like it will have some Nexus-specific tricks up its sleeve with a new Google launcher.  Android Police also found evidence of certain swipe actions to access the notifications pane with that glass panel. It looks something like this: If history tells us anything, we can expect these next Nexus phones around late September/early October. However, Google has been slowly pushing up the Nexus release date from spring to late winter. The added twist is that Android Nougat is already further along than previous Android software with the \u201cfinal\u201d release supposedly coming sometime after July \u2014 So in other words any day now? Verizon is going to carry the two "Nexus" handsets (note the quotation marks). \u2014 Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 5, 2016  Although I haven\u2019t been able to find any sort of pricing information, last year\u2019s 6p came in at $US500 with the 5x at a more affordable $US380. In Australia, they came in at $899 and $659 respectively. I have always lvoed the nexus phones after having a nexus 4, a 5 and a 6p, but i am worried that these devices won't live up to how satisfied I currently am with the 6p. The lack of forward facing speakers and a downsizing to 5.5 inch really is a big loss for me if confirmed. i have the Samsung galaxy s7 edge but don't use it too often as I find the speaker tinny and the fingerprint scanner is so unreliable compared to the nexus.  If the nexus' do appear in the leaked form, I won't know what to upgrade to... Maybe there is still hope for me that Sony can deliver an update to the Xperia Z ultra that I loved so much a few years ago and have heard rumours is coming back. I am stoked. I want to replace my Lumia 640, which is still very nice, but increasingly frustrating as I deal with no Chromecast support, etc. I like the Nexus range, and these are (hopefully) close enough in release date to justify waiting and not getting a 5X. I would love another Nexus but the price is no longer cheap as the Nexus 4. If they are going back to bargain market with high spec like they did with Nexus 4, I am sure it will be a killer again. 5x and 6P were too expensive.

VNonda Zus: intelligent car charger that will help you find your parked vehicle Here we look at some of the latest handy gadgets that have been attracting attention and investment from crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Chris Price reports The Tapp lock uses your fingerprint to unlock and can be authorised via a Smartphone app too Tapp Fingerprint Padlock from $39\u000ahttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tapp-the-world-s-first-smart-fingerprint-padlock#/ Always forgetting the code for your padlock? Or maybe you\u2019re worried about your lock being picked at the gym or when your leave your bike chained up to a cycle rack? Well, here\u2019s a possible solution. It\u2019s the world\u2019s first smart fingerprint padlock. Created by a Toronto-based firm, the Tapp Fingerprint lock comes in two versions, the $39 TappLite which is available in black and white and the more heavy duty $49 TappLock which comes in five colours (silver, white, grey, pink and black). Both padlocks are waterproof with the TappLock featuring a Lithium Ion battery that can be used to charge your smartphone or to communicate with your phone via Bluetooth. One neat feature is that you can grant anyone access to your lock from anywhere in the world with the TappLock app. Up to 200 fingerprints can be stored, and you can customise the time, location, and duration of access. At the time of writing, both products are looking for investment on crowdfunding website Indiegogo with over $150,000 having been raised so far (nearly four times more than its funding target). The UsBidi charger will automatically switch off when fully charged UsBidi from $25\u000ahttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/usbidi-the-world-s-most-intelligent-charger-ever#/ Billed as the most intelligent charger ever, the strangely named UsBidi is a charger that can two things very well. It can charge your phone very quickly when it\u2019s connected to the USB port of your computer or your car (not an AC power adaptor). And it can also save you a little bit of money and help the planet (albeit in a very small way) by automatically switching off when your device is fully charged. It claims to charge twice as quickly as a standard charger because it stops data synching once connected so that all the power is used to boost charging speed instead. Magnetic connectors are provided for tidy hold of the lead and it\u2019s available in different colours (black, blue, green) and in different lengths too (1ft, 3ft, 6ft).   With the CD Slot Mount you can attach devices to the CD tray CD slot mount from £14.99\u000ahttp://www.cdslotmount.com/ Awarded British invention of the year, the CD Slot Mount is a simple device to hold products like sat navs, mobile phones and web tablets in place on your CD tray. It all came about when the inventor had his sat nav stolen because \u2013 he reckons \u2013 of the visible suction marks on the windscreen. Simply place the piece of plastic in the CD tray and using the various attachments, including a sticky pad, you can easily hook up the devices via the protruding circular knobs. While the basic CD slot mount is £14.95, each of the holders for the various products are priced between £4.99 and £5.99. Nonda Zus: intelligent car charger that will help you find your parked vehicle Nonda ZUS smart car charger $33.99\u000ahttp://www.nonda.co/products/nonda-zus-smart-car-charger Left your car in a large busy car park at a festival or sporting event and can\u2019t find it? Previously you would have had to tie something distinctive to the antenna and hope to make it out in the distance. However, with the ZUS smart charger you can find your car via the Zus Android/iOS app on your smartphone (this can also be downloaded via www.zusapp.com). Whenever you park your car, ZUS will automatically save your vehicle\u2019s location using your phone\u2019s GPS. It\u2019s even possible to set a timer if you are parking on a meter so the app will remind you when you need to return to the car. The smart car charger, which was funded on Indiegogo, can also be used to charge two devices (ie. tablet and phone) simultaneously via the two USBs at twice the speed of standard car chargers, claims Nonda. You can see how the Nonda ZUS works in the YouTube video below:  With the Meem memory cable you can back up your phone\u2019s files during charging Meem Memory Cable from £49.99\u000ahttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/868671768/meem-memory-cable?ref=category_location Here\u2019s a clever little product, currently trying to raise funding on Kickstarter (at the time of writing it\u2019s raised a little over £30,000 of the £50,000 target). Basically it\u2019s phone charger cable that automatically backs up the personal data on your phone to the cable itself every time you charge the phone, whether that\u2019s by Power Adaptor, Car Charger, PC port or Power Bank. Rather than you having to worry about backing up your files to the cloud or your computer, all the data is stored on the cable. Two versions are available (32Gb or 64Gb) with data transfer speed approximately 3 to 4 Megabits per second which means it takes around six minutes to transfer 1Gb of data. Compatible with Apple and Android smart phones, it\u2019s currently available from Kickstarter from around £40.   Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp. There is always going to be one or two focus areas that will take your business to the next level. It is important to identify these and focus on them relentlessly, no matter how many things you have going on. Team, team, team. Spend as much time as you can in hiring the right people and once they\u2019re on board, spend time helping them succeed individually and as part of a unified team.  Beautiful Rome and rocketship businesses were not built in a day, a month or a year. I\u2019m tighter buddies now with Mr Calm and Miss Patience. I\u2019m very quick to sleep (just give me three quiet minutes!) and not fussy about sleep hours. I make it a point to get six hours of sleep every night as a minimum. It may seem cliche, but that\u2019s because it undoubtedly needs to be your numero uno: know your customer, their business profile, journey and pain points really, really well. Have you ever asked someone for a piece of paper to write on, and they\u2019ve brought you paper and a pen too? When you know your customer, you\u2019ll know how to delight them.\u000aWhen it comes to choosing your team, hire for integrity, passion and expertise. And possibly one of the most important thing is never think you\u2019ve succeeded, the bar can always be higher \u2014 that\u2019s how you continue to grow.

V The knife is the most important tool in the kitchen. But over time, they develop those pesky red rust stains, either from regular use, or maybe because it didn\u2019t dry completely after a previous wash. The best way to clean those is to leave the knife in a mug of vinegar for five minutes.\u000a\u000aYou need to take proper care of your knife. If you leave it wet, it will get rust stains, which don\u2019t come off no matter how much you scrub. We previously suggested dipping it in lime juice, but oh boy, who\u2019s going to get a mug of lime juice? Vinegar is easier to find in larger quantities. It is great for cleaning other things too, so buy a big bottle if you need to. Pour it out into a mug or a glass that is tall enough for the knife to be submerged. Rust stains are often closer to the handle, so measure the mug against the knife before you pour. After leaving the knife for five minutes, take it out and clean it thoroughly. This time, the rust stains will come out when you scrub. Quick Tips: Removing Rust Stains From Knives [One Pot Chef]

VMaintaining balance between the different parts of your life, from work to hobbies to family and friends, can take a lot of energy. Make things easier on yourself by using the \u201crule of four\u201d to focus on what is really important to you.\u000a\u000aImage from donnieray. Sometimes it can be hard to keep work from creeping into your personal time, especially if you have an overbearing boss. Chelsea Fagan, writing at The Financial Diet, explains how she keeps balance between her work and personal life. \u000aFor me, I have created the \u201cRule of Four\u201d to make sure I am constantly diversified and balanced in this regard, and always ready to say \u201cno\u201d to more work if it means throwing off the equilibrium. The \u201cRule of Four\u201d is simple \u2014 I must always have four concrete, tangible things in my life that make me feel happy, that make me feel like myself, that I devote time and energy to, and that I am actively constructing.\u000a For example, you might choose work, exercise, family and a hobby you\u2019re passionate about as your areas of focus. You don\u2019t have to limit your rule to four things, just stick to the idea that by limiting the number of things you commit your time and energy to, you end up with more things that you enjoy and don\u2019t overcommit yourself to work, favours and projects for other people.

VDrinking an average of 2.4 standard drinks per day for men and 1.6 drinks per day for women has been associated with a 36 per cent greater risk of death from cancer, as well as a 13 per cent greater risk of death from any cause. But a international research collaboration led by University of Sydney has found that exercising at even basic recommended weekly physical activity levels (at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity) may offset some of the harmful effects of drinking alcohol. Published today in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, this first-of-its-kind study found that for alcohol drinkers, physical activity may decrease the risks of dying both from cancer and from \u201call-cause mortality\u201d that is, deaths from any cause. The researchers drew on responses from eight nationally representative baseline health surveys carried out in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 2006 which looked at the impact of physical activity and alcohol consumption on health outcomes. \u201cAmong physically inactive people, we saw that the risk for cancer and all-cause mortality was higher even at relatively low levels of drinking,\u201d said senior author Associate Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis, from the Charles Perkins Centre and Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Sydney. \u201cWe also noticed a dose-response relationship between drinking alcohol and cancer deaths, that is the risk of cancer deaths increased as alcohol consumption increased. But this was not the case among physically active people.\u201d \u201cModerate\u201d drinkers (those drinking up to 17 standard Australian drinks per week for men, up to 11 for women) were 38 per cent more likely, \u201chazardous\u201d drinkers (those drinking between 17-39 standard Australian drinks per week for men and between 11-29 for women) were 40 per cent more likely and \u201charmful\u201d drinkers (over 39 standard Australian drinks per week for men, and over 28 standard drinks per week for women) were 74 per cent more likely to die from cancer. But this risk was substantially lessened or offset among those who were physically active at the basic recommended level (equivalent to at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity activity such as brisk walking) or at the upper recommended level (equivalent to at  least 300 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week). The surveys included questions about alcohol intake and physical activity levels among those aged 40 years and over \u2014 physical activity included walking and cycling and structured exercise or sport undertaken in the preceding four weeks. Total weekly alcohol intake was calculated by adding up the units of each type of drink and multiplying that by the reported frequency of consumption (1 UK unit=0.8 standard Australian drinks).  14.6 per cent (5307) of the respondents were lifelong abstainers and former drinkers, while 4845 (13.3 per cent) exceeded the then recommended weekly maximum. Those who said they had had a drink within the preceding week averaged just over 6 units (4.8 Australian standard drinks). In the physically active groups, only harmful levels of drinking were associated with increased risk of cancer death and death from any cause. \u201cOur research suggests that physical activity has substantial health benefits even in the presence of potentially unhealthy behaviours such as drinking alcohol,\u201d said Dr Stamatakis. \u201cWe cannot suggest that doing some exercise is a licence to drink more alcohol, as alcohol abuse causes significant health and societal damage. But given that so many people do drink alcohol, our study gives yet another compelling reason to encourage and empower people to be physically active and ask policy makers to invest in physical activity-friendly environments.\u201d These findings follow a recent review study found that alcohol can cause cancer of the oropharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colon, rectum and breast. These alcohol-attributable cancers at these sites make up 5.8 per cent of all cancer deaths world-wide. [BJS] > a 13 per cent greater risk of death from any cause. So... If every drinker dies are you saying that 8.9% of teetotallers are immortal?  What does this mean? It means that teetotallers have a 99% greater risk of death from being boring Are there really people that have 2.4 standard drinks a day??  I don't think of myself as a goody two-shoes, but I don't even have a glass of wine every day, let alone multiple ones every day of the week. Seriously? I drink at least 2.4 standard drinks - two stubbies of mid-strength beer - a day. Even though I don't drink every day, over a  week I probably drink 16-24 beers, which would average out to between three and four standard drinks per day. A case of beer usually lasts me a fortnight, plus whatever I consume at the pub. If that puts me at greater risk of health problems and death, I'm perfectly fine with that. I think it's the average. You may drink a little every couple of days, and then get totally wasted every weekend. You average out the drinks and it ends up being 2.4/day. oops.wrong reply \u000a									Last edited September 10, 2016 5:12 pm								 Lots of people, myself included. If my wife didn't get cranky, i'd drink more. 2.4 drinks is less than 2 beers, or 1 large glass of wine. I'd rather drink beer and die that not drink beer and live to be 80. Yes, 80. If I'm still alive when I'm 80 I am going to be seriously pissed off. Beer is one of the three most important things I eat and drink, along with meat and cheese. I might give up everything else in my life - cars, boats, everything! - but I would never even consider going without those three things (or music). You could put me in a tent in the middle of nowhere and make me sleep on the ground but so long as I had my Walkman and my B&O S3s, plus a steady supply of my favourite beer, meat and cheese, I would be the happiest person on the face of the planet. If I was dead in a year, I'd see it as worth every mouthful. I mean it stands to reason that sick people are less likely to exercise and also more likely to die young. People living with chronic illnesses ect will exercise less and also die younger.  This will immediately skew your results towards less exercise = die young. Whereas for healthy people there may be no correlation at all. Might be way off I mean I've got no background in this and they are university scientists. I'm also a bit cynical sometimes but every time I see a report about statistics that seems to push an agenda I do wonder if it is at all relevant. What agenda is this pushing? "our study gives yet another compelling reason to encourage and empower people to be physically active and ask policy makers to invest in physical activity-friendly environments.\u201d\u000abastards are trying to get more parks built/opened. Or, run, stay sober, and still die... Most men are known to die of a broken heart everytime the government increases the alcohol excise which falls under the 13% "death from any cause".

VNo new technology since the dawn of the internet has captured the imagination like blockchain. Designed to run unregulated electronic currency, the blockchain is promoted by many as having far broader potential in government, identity, voting, corporate administration and healthcare, to name just some of the proposed use cases. But these grand designs misunderstand what blockchain actually does. Blockchain is certainly important and valuable, as an inspiration for brand new internet protocols and infrastructure. But it\u2019s a lot like the Wright Brothers\u2019 Flyer, the first powered aeroplane. It\u2019s wondrous but impractical. Read on to find out more.  Stephen Wilson is a PhD Candidate, UNSW Australia. Not quite eight years ago, in November 2008, a mysterious and still unknown developer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin \u2013- the first practical electronic cash that didn\u2019t rely on a digital reserve bank. A decentralised crypto-currency scheme requires global consensus on when someone spends a virtual coin, so she cannot spend it again. Blockchain\u2019s trick is to broadcast every single bitcoin transaction to the whole community, which then in effect votes on the order in which transactions appear. Any attempt to \u201cdouble spend\u201d (move the same bitcoin twice), or to introduce a counterfeit coin that hasn\u2019t been seen on the network before, is detected and rejected. With no umpire, the continuous arbitration of blockchain entries requires a massive peer-to-peer network in order to resist distortion or manipulation. Anyone at all is free to join the blockchain network, as a holder and spender of currency, and/or as a node contributing to the consensus process. The incentive to participate comes in the form of a random reward paid whenever the ledger is settled, which is roughly every 10 minutes. The odds of a node winning the reward go up with the amount of computing power it adds to the network, and so running a node is dubbed bitcoin \u201cmining\u201d. The only authoritative record of anyone\u2019s bitcoin balance is held on the blockchain. Account holders operate a wallet application, which shows their balance and lets them spend it, moving bitcoin to other accounts. Counter-intuitively, these \u201cwallets\u201d hold no money; all they do is control account holders\u2019 private keys, and provide a user interface to what\u2019s in the blockchain. In fact bitcoin is entirely ethereal, with not even virtual coins. The Blockchain only records the movement of bitcoin in and out of account holders\u2019 wallets, and calculates virtual balances as the difference between what\u2019s been spent and what\u2019s been paid. The only way to spend your balance is to use your private key, to digitally sign an instruction to the network, specifying the amount to move, and the address (that is, the public key) of where to move it to. If a private key is lost or destroyed, then the balance associated with that key is frozen forever and can never be spent. Ever. There has been a string of notorious mishaps where computers or disk drives holding bitcoin wallets have been lost, together with millions of dollars of value they controlled. And predictably, numerous pieces of malicious software have been developed specifically to steal bitcoin private keys and balances. The enthusiasm for crypto-currency innovation has proven infectious; the feeling is that if blockchain \u201csquared the circle\u201d in payments, then it must have untold powers in other domains. In particular, many commentators have promoted blockchain for identity management. The conspicuous thing about proposals to put \u201cidentity on the blockchain\u201d is that they overwhelmingly come from blockchain advocates and not identity management experts. What\u2019s missing in the great majority of blockchain-for-identity proposals \u2013 and indeed in most of the non-payments use cases \u2013 is a careful statement of the problem and proper analysis of why distributed consensus is important. Sadly, when you look closely, the blockchain just doesn\u2019t do what most people seem to think it does. There is nothing \u201con\u201d the blockchain. All it holds is a record of bitcoin movements and associated metadata. The metaphor of recording anything \u201con\u201d it belies the need for additional technologies and processes over and above blockchain, to decide how to represent physical items in code and to oversee the assignment of those codes. These necessitate extra key management, registration of ownership, and governance. Blockchain does nothing about these realities, neither does any other distributed ledger technology that has followed in bitcoin\u2019s wake. Blockchain was expressly designed to manage crypto-currency without any key management or registration. No one is trusted in the naked bitcoin world. No administrator and no third party is needed to vouch for any wallet holder or network node. The lack of friction is great for the unbanked (as well as illicit users) and it also helps build the peer-to-peer network, which must be maintained at a huge scale in order to guard against those untrusted participants conspiring against the system. And it\u2019s best to remember that the incentive to run blockchain nodes comes from the mining reward. Take bitcoin away from non-payment use cases and it\u2019s unclear who will pay for the infrastructure, and how. The original blockchain is not separable from bitcoin. Now, there is certainly plenty of fresh research and development being done on alternative consensus mechanisms and participation models. But nothing yet is up and running like the established public blockchain, and nothing else has yet been proven with blockchain\u2019s security properties. Blockchain does just one thing: it establishes the order of entries in a distributed ledger, so as to prevent double spend without an umpire. The truth of the contents of the ledger is an entirely different matter. Blockchain doesn\u2019t magically make the entries themselves trustworthy, let alone the people that created them. Despite the hype, blockchain is not a \u201ctrust protocol\u201d; it\u2019s actually the opposite. Just think about it: it\u2019s not as though paying by bitcoin stops you from being ripped off. For anything of value other than bitcoin to be transacted via the blockchain requires additional layers of agents, third parties and auditors \u2013 things that just don\u2019t square with the trust-free architecture. Lofty claims are made for blockchain\u2019s ability to decentralise all sorts of things. But in truth, blockchain only decentralises the adjudication of the order of entries in a ledger. It is not a general or native \u201cInternet of Value\u201d as claimed by authors like Don and Alex Tapscott. It was expressly designed for electronic cash; it has no native connection to real world assets. Few businesses have escaped the call to evaluate blockchain technologies. If you\u2019ve been persuaded to have a look, then as a first step, re-examine your security and record keeping needs. Take the time to understand what blockchain does, and all the things it leaves to be done by other systems. If your business is decentralised and your assets are purely digital, then blockchain has a lot to offer, but otherwise, it\u2019s just another database. This article was originally published on The Conversation. This article keeps conflating generic blockchain applications with "proof of work" bitcoin-style blockchains. The surge of interest lately is not in the crypto-currency networks, it is in the general purpose ledger applications. There need not be any "mining". The nodes would be run by organisations with interests in whatever is being tracked by the ledger. The ledger may not hold the actual data, but it can hold a hash of the system's state. It won't be a panacea but it could let A and B agree on their current status and prevent either from cheating. But if it's being controlled by one or a few entities, then doesn't it defeat the purpose of a block chain - being decentralised? Aren't there easier ways to create a ledger and avoid order conflicts, ie time stamping? Decentralisation doesn't mean the network has to be open to all and sundry in the public. A blockchain could service a number of banks performing settlements, or it could be useful in a single company spread across multiple regions for stock control. There are a number of competing consensus algorithms that deal with conflicts and transaction order on a blockchain. I'm not sure a simple timestamp would solve much alone, unless you implicitly trust whoever produced the timestamp. That makes me think  of a Time Stamp Authority - a network server that signs the timestamp and source material with their trusted certificate.

V  Apple Pay, one of the latest forms of digital payment via your mobile, is slowly gaining acceptance Mobile payments, biometrics and crypto currencies. These were just some of the emerging trends discussed at the recent Westminster eForum Keynote Seminar at London\u2019s Royal Society. Tech Digest\u2019s Chris Price reports The way we spend our money is changing rapidly. Only a few years ago cash was king and cheques were regularly written out to make payments in store as well as to clubs, schools and to friends. But with the advent of digital technology, traditional methods of payment are starting to disappear. Even payment via credit and debit card using CHIP and PIN is now beginning to look dated as we\u2019re increasingly using our mobile phones to make and receive payments using services like Apple Pay as well as contactless technology for offline transactions (ie. paying for a bus or tube journey). As this is happening, the big high street banks which once held the monopoly on our funds are losing some of their power. Instead we\u2019re seeing the emergence of new challenger banks like the digital-only Atom Bank, which recently received a £45 million investment from BBVA taking its total funding to £135 million despite the fact that it\u2019s not due to launch until early 2016. At the same time we\u2019re witnessing the continued rise of online payment services such as Paypal. Indeed according to Stella Bokun, Manager, Telecoms Software, Analysys Mason, in \u2018Spain and Germany the use of Paypal has already overtaken credit and debit cards for online payment\u2019. But is cash really going to die any time soon? Not according to Seamus Smith, CEO of online payment system Sagepay. \u201cWe will be cardless before we are cashless,\u201d he told audiences at the Westminster eForum Keynote Seminar at London\u2019s Royal Society. Although alternative systems to cash, such as Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology which it uses, are gaining momentum they still remain very niche propositions. Paying by phone with Pingit Mobile phone payment services, on the other hand, are starting to grow quickly with five new services planning to launch next year according to Craig Tillotson, Chief Executive of Faster Payments \u2013 a UK banking initiative to reduce payment times between different banks\u2019 customer accounts from three working days to just a few hours. Currently around £1 in every £4 is spent online and spending via mobile is growing at four times the rate of spending online via non-mobile (ie via desktop/laptop computer). Services such as Pingit from Barclays, which uses the Faster Payments service, enable customers to make payments via any kind of mobile phone to all UK current account holders with needing account number/sort code details. What\u2019s more, you don\u2019t have to be a Barclays customer to use it any more. Barclays has also recently teamed up with Zapp so that Pingit can be used at point of sale terminals in shops and online where the Pay By Bank app symbol is shown. Says Faster Payment\u2019s Tillotson. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen growth of more than 15 per cent a year because of mobile banking.\u201d With Paym, the standard used by Pingit, also agreed by most of the high street banks we are likely to see more of these services gain in popularity during 2016. Nor will it just be the big established high street banks which will start to launch new types of digital payment services. So too will companies classified as \u2018near banks\u2019 such as Simple which claims to offer a mobile optimised banking experience and which has recently been acquired by Spain\u2019s second biggest bank, BBVA. There are also new types of \u2018digital wallet\u2019 services emerging which use social media for payments such as Venmo which is designed for sharing expenses between friends, including restaurant bills, taxi fares and even rental payment. All you need to do is sign in using Facebook and download the app (Android or Apple iOS) to your smart phone. Will cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ever reach the mainstream? Biometric technology Of course these new methods of payment for goods and services aren\u2019t going to be adopted over night. It\u2019s taken seven years even for contactless payment cards to reach critical mass and it\u2019s likely to be another few years before the mass market is comfortable with the idea of using their phones to make payments in store or on transport networks. In part this is because the technology isn\u2019t quite ready. According to Mike Tuckett, Head of Transformation Delivery, Transport for London, around a quarter of PAYG journeys on the tube are now made via a contactless debit or credit card with 8 million cards having been used for the transactions. However the same can\u2019t be said for Apple Pay which remains a niche proposition. This is probably because using a mobile phone to touch in and touch out via Apple Pay is currently very difficult. Firstly before you approach a ticket gate you need to double-click the Home button of your iPhone to bring up your default card in Apple Pay. Then you will need to authorise the transaction by placing your finger on Touch ID until you see \u2018Hold near Reader to pay\u2019 on the display. Using an Apple Watch the process is a little easier but you really need to wear the watch on your right arm as the card readers are usually on the right of the turnstile. According to Jonathan Vaux, Executive Director, New Digital Payments and Strategy, Visa Europe, cards work every time whereas fingerprint readers currently aren\u2019t always that reliable. However, he admits that for the younger generation \u2018Touch ID is natural whereas a PIN is seen as quite intrusive.\u2019 Older people though are often nervous about new technology, partly because of fears over whether it\u2019s secure. \u201cWe need to make the customer feel safe,\u201d adds Vaux. However for Dave Birch, Director of Innovation, Consult Hyperion, biometric technology, including fingerprint recognition and even face recognition, could be particularly useful for older generations too. \u201cAlthough we tend to think of the technology for millennials there is a fantastic opportunity for older people who can\u2019t always remember their PIN number.\u201d Deutsche Bank is even trialling a technology that claims to identify who you are from the way you hold a screen, how you touch it and heavily you press the virtual keyboard buttons.

p390
VWhile there was no new footage or casting announcements made for Star Trek: Discovery at Mission New York today, there was a video from executive producers Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman, which talked a little bit about the choices they have made with the new show.  \u201cThis ship is called the Discovery for a few reasons,\u201d said Fuller. \u201cNot the least of which is Stanley Kubrick\u2019s contribution to the Discovery on 2001: A Space Odyssey, NASA\u2019s vessel the Discovery, and also the sense of discovery.\u201d He also drew a connection between the meaning of the word to fans, adding that part of the title comes from \u201cwhat the word \u2018discovery\u2019 means to Star Trek audiences who have been promised a future by Gene Roddenberry where we come together as a planet and seek new worlds and new alien races to explore and understand and collaborate with.\u201d Fuller said that they see this whole show as a chance to \u201creinvent, re-explore, and reintroduce\u201d the familiar things about Star Trek \u2014 especially alien races that audiences would recognise \u2014 but also bring a bunch of new ships, aliens, and technology to the Star Trek universe. As for the decision to make the main character not be the captain this time around, Fuller said in the video: \u201cThere have been six series all from the captains\u2019 perspective, and it felt like for this new iteration of Star Trek, we need to look at life on a Starfleet vessel from a new perspective.\u201d The new character is \u201cnot a captain,\u201d but is going to have a \u201cwhole new dynamic\u201d with the crew. Fuller said that this will let them tell \u201cricher, more complicated\u201d stories about life on the Starfleet vessel. The video itself didn\u2019t reveal anything, the footage was from the old shows intercut with the video of the Discovery revealed in July. The only thing that was actually new was a single shot of some alien latex that looked lizard-based. We\u2019ve been teased this way before. At the panel in person were Nicholas Meyer and Kirsten Beyer, who both sit in the writers\u2019 room for the new series. They also couldn\u2019t give any specifics about the show, but both agreed that their jobs were to service Bryan Fuller\u2019s vision for the show. Although Meyer did have one piece of advice for a fan looking for assurance that the show would be everything they hoped it would be: \u201cLower your expectations.\u201d He continued, a bit later, \u201cIt is a symbiotic relationship and all I\u2019m suggesting is that if you go with open minds and open hearts, you may be rewarded. Whereas if you go with a set of impossible to realise expectations, which even you cannot specifically define, then we\u2019re bound to fail. And so I\u2019m saying: Get loose.\u201d \u201cLower your expectations.\u201d Sound advice in a time when everything gets so over-promoted and over-hyped that when it finally gets released people are pissed because it doesn't turn out to be what producers never said it would be. Im pretty excited about this show and the choice to base it on normal crew members.  Will be interesting to see other areas of the ships etc not often shown. I pretty skeptical about this (would love to be wrong though!) .\u000aThe wording we keep getting about the "not a captain" thing is a bit weirdly worded and specific. makes me think they're using it as a misdirect.\u000aOdds are we're going to get either a "low rank has command thrust on them expectantly" story or the focus will be on a specific bridge officer with the captain as a mentor more than a focal point. It could even be a bit "Mystery Box" style fake out and the commander of the ship will just have a different rank (Admiral maybe?). DS9 was from a 'commanders' perspective  until halfway through season 3, when Sisko was promoted to captain. This may be the same once again after a 'tragic accident' that kills off the captain of the show.

VVideo: The robotic versions of competitive sports are usually disappointing at best \u2014 but not when it comes to sumo wrestling. The human titans who try to slowly push each other out of a circular ring are actually far less exciting than these tiny zippy robots whose matches are usually over almost as quickly as they begin.\u000a\u000aUnlike BattleBots, where the robots are piloted by humans with wireless controllers, these Sumo bots are all completely autonomous. They\u2019re also pretty devious when it comes to the tactics and tools they use once a match begins. Mechanical lifts, extending arms and brute force all play important roles in this wrestling league, besides simply just ramming your opponent into submission at high speed as soon as a match begins. Nothing gets destroyed by the match\u2019s end, which is admittedly a little disappointing, but you\u2019ll still find yourself cheering for a favourite. [YouTube via The Awesomer]

VThere\u2019s a snazzy new Blu-ray of John Carpenter\u2019s monster classic The Thing coming out in October. One of its new features is a commentary track with cinematographer Dean Cundey \u2014 who reveals a sly lighting technique used throughout the film to indicate when a character has become no longer human.\u000a\u000aImage: The Thing wikia Cundey, whose career includes several other Carpenter films (including Big Trouble in Little China), as well as Jurassic Park and Apollo 13, broke it down to Blumhouse\u2019s Rob Galluzzo, who interviews him for the commentary track: \u000aEarly on in the commentary track, I asked Cundey if he and John discussed doing a subtle lighting trick to imply who might be \u201cthe thing.\u201d He waited until the blood scene to answer my question. As the scene began, he explained, \u201cSo we were looking for some kind of a subtle way, to say which one of these (men) might be human. You\u2019ll notice there\u2019s always an eye light, we call it, a little gleam in the eye of the actor. It gives life.\u201d\u000a This is a fun thing to look out for during the blood-test scene \u2014 which I usually spend counting down the seconds until I can yell the \u201cTIED TO THIS FUCKING COUCH\u201d line \u2014 but it really gets interesting when you think about The Thing\u2018s final moments. Standing by the flaming wreckage of their base, MacReady (Kurt Russell) and Childs (Keith David), who have absolutely no reason to trust each other, decide to just wait and \u201csee what happens\u201d. Though Cundey tells Galluzzo that Carpenter wanted to keep the ending ambiguous, anyone who watches the film can\u2019t help but wonder if one of the men has already been overtaken by the alien. Looking for the \u201clittle gleam\u201d might best be done on the big screen (or at least on the new Blu-ray, which boasts a brand-new 2K scan of The Thing\u2018s original interpositive film). But as others have pointed out, it sure looks like Childs is the one with something to hide:  The Thing Collector\u2019s Edition is out in the US and Canada on October 11 from Scream Factory. An Australian release has not been confirmed. [Slashfilm via Blumhouse] Always thought it was Childs. A true classic in scifi/horror. Carpenter was at his peak here, great director and musician. I always thought they were both clean at the end and while the Thing may still be lurking in some form it wasn't them. They were just two guys doomed to freeze to death. Made it more poignant to me thinking they'd managed to prevent it's spread to the rest of humanity at the cost of both their lives. Good point. I never actually thought of the idea of the Thing still being out there, which was a strong possibility, given its ability to survive. The core of the film, being about doubt and distrust, I liked the idea that one of them remained the Thing. I watched the end last night and both of their eyes appeared to gleam, so I was wrong, damn these BR audio tracks, they ruin all my favourite ambiguous endings. I think you can still interpret it however you like. To be fair I think the eye gleam thing would be so hard to pull off when they're sitting near a fire. It'd be just about impossible to pull off a shot where there wasn't some reflection in their eyes. Just re-watched it now. Both had the gleam in the eyes so I guess both were human after all. Kinda makes sense to me, I got the feeling they had won but realized they were both screwed anyway. yeah i can only guess but my hunch is they were both human The breath, look at the breath!\u000athis has been known for years. MacReady's breath is steamy, Childs' isnt.\u000apretty sure this was confirmed as being the indication at some point years ago. Except the breath being steamy varies because of angle. It's more obvious if the light hits it right. I'm also pretty sure one of the other things had steamy breath.

VOn Saturday, Russian officials announced that atheist vlogger Ruslan Sokolovsky has been detained for two months for \u201cinciting hatred\u201d and \u201cinsulting religious feelings\u201d after posting a video of himself playing Pokémon Go inside a historic cathedral. He reportedly faces up to five years in jail if convicted.  In July, state-owned news channel Russia-24 warned that Pokémon Go users could be jailed under Russia\u2019s strict anti-blasphemy laws if they played the game in church. In protest, Sokolovsky filmed himself catching Pokémon in Yekaterinburg\u2019s Church of All Saints and shared the footage on YouTube.  According to Meduza, police began investigating Sokolovsky soon after, finally detaining the 22-year-old vlogger this weekend. In a statement, Russian Orthodox Church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda claimed it was the provocative nature of Sokolovsky\u2019s video \u2014 and not playing the game itself \u2014 that led to his arrest. \u201cIt is clear that Mr. Sokolovsky was not a casual passerby, who in a fit of gaming passion went into the temple, but rather a well-known young blogger in the city, who works in the style of Charlie Hebdo,\u201d wrote Vladimir Legoyda on Facebook. However, Jaroslav Nilov, head of the State Duma\u2019s religious affairs committee, said that investigators have not proven that Sokolovsky violated Russia\u2019s anti-blasphemy law and called his detention unnecessary. \u201cIn my opinion, catching Pokémon is not an insult to religious feelings, because it is simply the use of a mobile phone application within religious buildings,\u201d Nilov told RIA Novosti. [Vocativ] There is a law against exactly this stupid behavior in Russia... he knew that and yet he decided to test the system... eye roll... Very true, but I guess if he gets away with it he can be guaranteed more subscribers That's the sad factor, anything to get views and subscribers. Even if its illegal. Yep and there is a law against being gay too, and all manner of other stuff Putin and his bearded cronies dislike. Which was rather the point - stupid laws need challenging. People who are gay are just gay. Nobody 'BECOMES' gay just so they can stick it to Putin and his stupid law. This guy went out of his way to commit a crime in order to make a point (ahem, in order to get views). Yes, stupid laws need to be challenged, but not by breaking them deliberately. That's the difference. There's nothing wrong with playing Pokemon Go, but it probably is rude to play it during a church service. If you are not interested in the service and would rather play Pokemon, then why go to church in the first place? Stay home and play Pokemon. Like the priest said, this wasn't a random incident, he's just trying to be a knob in order to gain views. Some people are just rude.

VStar Trek\u2018s ideals don\u2019t sit all that well with your average video game. Trek\u2018s idealistic view of the future mostly dealt with conflict through discussion rather than liberal phaser blasts to the face, and video games are usually the other way around. That\u2019s why a first-person shooter in the Star Trek universe should never have worked. Until it did.  Released in 2000 and set during the sixth season of Voyager, Raven Software\u2019s Elite Force put players in the boots of Alex Munro, second-in-command of a new \u201cHazard Team\u201d security force created by Tuvok to handle the increasingly hostile areas of the Delta Quadrant. You were the security team called in when shit went down, and Elite Force was all about shit going down \u2014 Voyager gets transported to a derelict ship graveyard by a mysterious shockwave, and while the Bridge crew were tasked with investigating how to get back to their journey home, Hazard Squad was called in to protect them\u2026 mainly by blasting anything in sight that even looked at you funny. Seven of Nine and Hazard Team transporting to an Away mission.\u000aAnd hoo boy, could you blast things. Previous Star Trek games gave fans the thrill of piloting ships and exploring strange new worlds, but Elite Force was about letting you experience tons of crazy Trek weapons. Elite Force was one of the rare Trek games out at the time to actually give you the sense of being someone on the ground of the Star Trek universe. While Elite Force was a great shooter \u2014 with a multiplayer component based off of Quake III Arena, as crazy and intense as any PC shooter on the market at the time, but made even better with its Star Trek skin \u2014 where it truly shone is using its first-person perspective beyond shooting action to root you in the world of Voyager. In between action missions, Munro was mostly given free reign to explore the halls of Voyager, performing tasks for members of the crew. Of course\u000aYou could interact with the main cast of the show, all voiced by their actual actors (Jeri Ryan did not initially return to reprise her role as Seven of Nine, but later did for the game\u2019s expansion, re-recording all of her lines for the base game as well). For the time, the graphics were top notch, and unlike past games where you were restricted to only a few locales to visit, Elite Force\u2018s recreation of Voyager was grand in scale. The game\u2019s expansion pack added a mode that added another 10 decks worth of the ship to explore in \u201cVirtual Voyager\u201dmode, which let you poke and prod at replicators, panels in engineering, perform shipboard tasks for the bridge crew, and read personal logs (including Neelix\u2019s recipe for Leola root soup!).  At the time, it was remarkable: the chance to completely explore one of franchise\u2019s famous ships from stem to stern, and be part of that world in a tangible, personal manner. It was a playground to explore and interact with a Star Trek series unlike anything any previous game had attempted. As someone who was young enough to discover Star Trek through Voyager, it was an incredible experience. Star Trek games since have often struggled to balance solid gameplay that video game fans crave with the chance to explore the franchise\u2019s beloved universe, to capture that intangible but vital \u201ctrekky\u201d feeling. Elite Force was arguably the first that gave Trek fans the best of both worlds \u2014 and that\u2019s why 16 years later it\u2019s still my favourite Star Trek game. Amen - totally agree with you on this - fantastic game, original voice cast, stunning detail in the ship and story and action that fits the Voyager/Star Trek world For me, the best Star Trek games were A Final Unity and Starfleet Academy. I'd prefer a Trek game with original characters such as kirk, spock and bones with some humour tossed in as well as the fps action. You'd have to play the part of a red shirt. Would be a short game.

VAfter you\u2019ve spent enough time in the company of geeks and nerds, someone will eventually ask the inevitable question: Star Wars or Star Trek? And I always give the same answer: Star Wars was my first love, but Star Trek is my best love.\u000a\u000aImage: CBS Everyone has a fandom origin story, the way they explain why they carry a love of a certain thing through their whole life, the thing that connected to them in a way that nothing else had before. This is mine. I was eight when I first saw the Star Wars special edition in theatres. I owe Star Wars a lot, including feeding a voracious reading appetite with many, many books of questionable quality. I owe Star Wars for providing an escape during an extremely difficult time in my life, and I love it a lot, but there is one point I need to make: At the end of the day, the three main characters of the original trilogy are three white people. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that I became enamoured with Star Trek during the period when one captain was black and the other was a woman. It meant everything in the world to me that Star Trek wasn\u2019t only diverse, but that its main characters were. And that no one made those jokes about them. It meant everything in the world to me that Star Trek presented a future where a woman who had the same first name as me could be in charge. It meant everything to me to see female characters with stories that weren\u2019t romances. It meant everything to me to see all of this depicted in our future. Star Trek still means the world to me. There\u2019s a narrative about nerds and the things they love. It usually goes something like this: I was an outcast, but this thing gave me a place. It\u2019s the myth that gives so many people strength, but also leads to people asking for your \u201cgeek card\u201d to prove you\u2019re a \u201creal\u201d fan. It\u2019s always offensive, but I find it even more offensive when it\u2019s applied to Star Trek. Because Star Trek has its outsider characters, but the message I got from it wasn\u2019t \u201cthere\u2019s somewhere for you to go,\u201d it was \u201cthere\u2019s nowhere you can\u2019t go.\u201d Or, to eliminate the double negative, \u201canyone can go anywhere.\u201d At its most basic, Star Trek is a show set in a future where humans have overcome sexism and racism and classism and every other negative -ism out there in order to explore space. Explore, not conquer. It\u2019s a stupidly hopeful view of the future. It was optimistic in 1966, and it\u2019s even more so now, when the rest of science fiction television is concerned with whether or not humanity is going to survive. It\u2019s aspirational. It\u2019s inspirational. It\u2019s earnest. Being earnestly optimistic is a hard sell. In our media, we\u2019re conditioned to find it shallow or unconvincing. Fiction, especially genre fiction, is dark and gritty because those things are always paired with the word \u201crealistic\u201d. And the good thing, the great thing about Star Trek is how easy it is to believe in the future it presents. The characters have real flaws, the Federation makes mistakes and things go wrong. You can see people you know now living in that future, which makes it feel even more attainable. When I was a kid, I may have fantasised about having a lightsaber, but I believed in the Star Trek future. It sounds stupid and trite and I legitimately hate myself a little bit for saying that Star Trek made me a better person. But it did. I read so many books because they were mentioned in Star Trek. I read Moby Dick, The Republic and Greek mythology because I was 10 and Star Trek referenced them. I made friends online because Star Trek created that community. I worked hard in school and went to university and spent the entire time believing I could bring Star Trek\u2018s future a little bit closer. I loved Star Wars, but my love of Star Wars didn\u2019t inspire me to seek out other things. It was Star Trek that made me into a science fiction fan. I read Heinlein, Herbert and Atwood and everything else because Star Trek made me want more stories like the ones it was telling. And I read them because the Star Trek fans I saw on the internet were talking about them. I joined my first listserv for Star Trek, and it remains the only time I have stopped lurking in a fandom and actually participated. Is Star Trek perfect? No. God, no. In fact, the phrase \u201cmy precious garbage child\u201d is my preferred name for Star Trek. But, as badly as it has stumbled, Star Trek always felt like it was trying. And, as I\u2019ve explained many times, I\u2019d rather watch Star Trek try and fail than a million other boring things try and succeed. Next to my friends and family, Star Trek defines who I am the most. Peel away my anger and my jokes, and my core self is someone who believes in all the things that Star Trek says. Bryan Fuller, in talking about the new Star Trek: Discovery show, has said some variation on \u201cwe need Star Trek now, more than ever\u201d a couple of times. I agree, but I also think that we always need Star Trek. Even if we ever get to the point where we, as a planet, are as advanced as Star Trek predicts, we\u2019ll still need it \u2014 for its storytelling, for its iconic characters, for everything it does well. And I\u2019ll always need Star Trek, to remind me that it\u2019s not stupid to hope for better things. To entertain me when I just want to watch Kirk get beaned in the head with a tribble \u2014 to give me the rush of happiness I got back when I was just discovering it. I make a living writing about science fiction on the internet. And I get a lot of hate for a lot of things: For being a woman, for not being white and sometimes, when I\u2019m really lucky, solely for my opinions. And it would grind me down more if I weren\u2019t, underneath, still that kid seeing Janeway and Sisko for the first time. And that is why I am fan of many things, but Star Trek is the one I love best. Yeah, I love Star trek but I've never liked Star Wars at all. Saw it in the theatre as a child and it just didn't wow me. Don't mind clone wars sometimes. The early series.

VThe ridesharing service Uber is pretty close to getting the go-ahead in almost all states and territories in Australia, with Victoria set to follow Queensland in introducing new legislation.  In the short term, Uber has committed to creating tens of thousands of new jobs in Australia. Many thousands of jobs have already been created and your typical Uber driver speaks positively of being empowered in a flexible working arrangement. But we know Uber has other plans. Like almost all large car and technology corporations such as Toyota, Ford and Google, Uber is investing heavily in self-driving technology. It\u2019s already testing its driverless technology in Pittsburgh, in the US. A rival, nuTonomy, has also started trials of driverless taxis at a Singapore business park. With drivers contributing a large fraction of operating costs, removing them through automation has an enormous commercial motivation. If companies solve the technological problems and successfully navigate the government policy landscape, millions of transport-related jobs worldwide are at risk, including Uber and taxi drivers, truck drivers, posties and fast food delivery drivers, just to name a few. This is just one in a stream of events where technology is changing society. Each of these events has an immediate impact on society. What if we step back from Uber\u2019s short-term aim and examine who are likely to be the big winners and losers in this technological arms race for driverless cars. Universities are winners and losers. While the large-scale hiring of researchers from US university Carnegie Mellon to Uber became public in 2015, top researchers, especially young ones, are moving to self-driving car and artificial intelligence (AI) corporates and start-ups. While in the past universities have performed much of the critical research leading to technological breakthroughs, this is less likely to be true in the age of self-driving cars. Current autonomous car research is extremely resource intensive. Fleets of development vehicles must be maintained and large teams of engineers must be employed. There are also mind-blowing amounts of data to be stored and processed using massive computer resources. Some universities have remained connected. For example, Toyota has funded research at the University of Michigan, Stanford and MIT to the tune of almost one hundred million dollars. But many universities have lost their top talent. A brain drain itself does not have to be a long-term problem, if some of those researchers eventually come back to share their experience or establish collaborative relationships with industry. However, the stakes are so high and commercially important that meaningful collaboration between corporations and universities is arguably getting rarer in the robotics research area. It is also a problem if none of the most exciting researchers and teachers are left at universities to educate and inspire the next generation of robotics engineers. If society transitions successfully to an ownerless car culture where cars are summoned upon demand, there are potential huge environmental benefits. Properly implemented, self-driving cars will drive in a more fuel or energy efficient manner. Networked car fleets will further reduce energy consumption by reducing traffic congestion. The biggest potential environmental win is simply from having far fewer cars in existence. It is estimated that you can meet a typical city\u2019s current transport needs with a much smaller fleet of shared pool cars compared to the current privately owned car system. It is not hard to conclude that if there will be far fewer cars in the future then the world may need fewer car manufacturers or that current car companies will make far fewer cars. It is quite conceivable that a number of today\u2019s large automotive companies will not exist a decade after self-driving fleet cars dominate the roads. This may be one of the reasons it seems that every major car maker is racing to develop this new technology. It is simply survival of the fittest. With fewer people needing to learn to drive, there will be less demand for driving instructors. The trend in developed countries is that fewer young people are learning to drive. Many simply do not see the point in spending time and money learning to drive when they can simply get out their phone and call an Uber. This trend is especially true in highly urbanised areas, where ride services are most plentiful and where the cost and hassle of owning a car is often highest. As consumers, we are likely to both win and lose. Potential monopolies are a risk; in the US this isn\u2019t currently a problem due to fierce competition between ride sharing companies such as Uber and rival ride-share operator Lyft. Uber is currently the dominant ride sharing option in Australia so only time will tell whether real competition will occur. Improving the safety of car occupants and pedestrians is also a potential big win for consumers, especially if better autonomous driving systems can make a dint in the thousand-plus annual fatalities in Australia and the more than a million deaths annually worldwide. If the technology works, reducing fatalities including those caused by drink driving and fatigue, is fantastic for everyone. Your transport experience itself may or may not improve. One of the big, less glamorous motivating factors around self-driving cars is that we spend a comparable amount of time in our cars as on the internet. The company that gets significant market share in this space may choose to monetise your driving time with ads (something you already experience in some taxis). Consumers may be faced with the unenvious choice of paying a hefty no ads premium charge fee, or being deluged by ads that they can\u2019t turn off or mute. When you first get into an autonomous ride-sharing car, who do you think will be in control? Perhaps Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s 1990 movie Total Recall gives us a glimpse of what the future may hold (language warning).   Michael Milford, Associate professor, Queensland University of Technology and Jonathan Roberts, Professor in Robotics, Queensland University of Technology This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article. "... your typical Uber driver speaks positively of being empowered in a flexible working arrangement." Says who? One of my neighbours, who drives a taxi, was looking to jump ship and join Uber but he was saying last night that Uber drivers in Sydney average about $8.50 an hour so he's decided to stick with driving taxis. What about Economy?\u000aI think the praise Uber drivers have for the business seems stark, their business model is to hire lots of people as contractors and run their business at a loss until they can fire everyone. I find the race to Driverless cars will have a huge impact on the economy.  They are deliberatly and forcefully lowering prices below what is economically sustainable for them in an order to push out Taxi industry and other competitors.    They are currently claiming tax concessions for their losses, but once the move to driverless they want to create a monopoly from the industry they destroyed.  If a supermarket or airline did that we would have the government and ACCC up in arms over it Do you think any profits will be reported or kept in Australia?  No, it will be offshore before you can say shell game. "If society transitions successfully to an ownerless car culture where cars are summoned upon demand..." What would be the impetus for this? If the only reason anyone owned a car was to get from A to B, we would all be driving around in $20,000 Chinese cars. The reality is that cars are the ultimate status symbol (more portable than your house) and people are never going to let go of them. Driverless cars will be transport for the proletariat, replacing buses and trains, anyone who can afford a car will continue to own a car. "... you can meet a typical city\u2019s current transport needs with a much smaller fleet of shared pool cars". Again, this assumes cars are only for getting from A to B. They are not. e.g. I use my bicycle to get around most of the time, even for my weekly trip to the supermarket to buy groceries, my car is there for me to enjoy on the weekends. I also use it to store things, like all my keys and my emergency supply of beer, so those things are readily available. "It is quite conceivable that a number of today\u2019s large automotive companies will not exist a decade after self-driving fleet cars dominate the roads." No, it isn't. They may all shrink but the market will still be large enough to sustain them all. "The trend in developed countries is that fewer young people are learning to drive. Many simply do not see the point in spending time and money learning to drive when they can simply get out their phone and call an Uber." I think you'll find it is far more tied up in the ease of getting their parents to give them a lift. When I was young, we were a one car family until I turned 17 and got myself a car. It didn't just mean freedom for me but for my mother (who couldn't drive) and my siblings because what had been a 90 minute journey to the CBD by public transport was just 20-25 minutes by car. Today it is unthinkable that a mother couldn't drive or that a family could get by with just one car, despite vastly improved public transport. (If I was living where I grew up today, I could get an express bus direct to the city in 30-35 minutes.) So the disinterest in young people stems from a lack of need long before they can afford to Uber themselves around. Well said. This article more sounded like the opening spill to a share holders meeting. Yep.  I agree with everything you've said. I think driverless car proponents miss the point about as badly as Sony's marketing department did with No Man's Sky.  The change, if there is one, will be over a generation or more.  It almost definitely won't happen as quickly as a decade. A car is a luxury item.  Many, many people don't need a reason to own one, beyond just wanting it.  If anything, these people will want to buy their own self-driving car. The only thing that might affect that desire would be government legislation (taxing non-driverless, subsidising driverless, etc) but you could pretty much guarantee an almighty battle against something like that.  Fortunately, by then I'll probably be too old to care. I love the pursuit of knowledge that is the push towards driverless cars - that doesn't mean I want one.  That said, I WOULD like a car that could get me home safely after a big night out, or that meant I didn't have to try to find a park within a reasonable distance of the office (Toowong, Brisbane, what a shit-fight!).  Alternatively, perhaps someone could build a quality high speed broadband network that meant telecommuting was a realistic option... oh, wait... While you make some good points, I think your generalisations are just as sweeping as the article's. Some people will continue to own cars (though most will at least have a driverless capability), but if ownership costs keep rising and ride costs decrease, that will certainly push a number of others towards rental. It seems very likely to me that the landscape will shift significantly for many. cars are the ultimate status symbol (more portable than your house)If that were the only factor we'd be wearing Rolexes instead. Cars have obvious utility, for some much more than others, and those who need only occasional transport are much more likely to choose a more convenient status symbol than a car. my car is there for me to enjoy on the weekends.For the cost of owning and maintaining your car (which is mostly idle all week), you could likely afford the occasional rental of a much fancier car when you wanted to enjoy driving, rather than just get from A to B. Certainly some will feel that way, though others of course may prefer to own their own. They may all shrink but the market will still be large enough to sustain them all.I would not be confident in asserting that. If the market shrinks (as it may well, if less people choose ownership), then history shows mature markets are more likely to see big players gobble up smaller ones. Perhaps if self-driving or electric technology somehow lower the bar enough then we might see an influx of newer & smaller players like Tesla, but that's not clear yet. the disinterest in young people stems from a lack of needIt's certainly true that as city density increases and transport infrastructure improves, there is less need to actually own a car of your own. Personally I know a number of people in their 20s and 30s, even some in their 40s, who don't own a car and don't plan to - most can drive, but take PT, Uber, or Go-Get depending on their needs at the time. The majority of these could afford a car if they wanted to, but prefer to spend their money elsewhere, e.g. on better living, or travel. It seems likely to me that this number will only increase, even without self-driving cars to lower the costs of rides. Ever rented a car? It's a royal PITA. you'd rather own a car than go through that. Rental fleets also tend to be very limited compared to what's out there to buy. I am certainly unaware of any rental cars that would compare to my car - small turbo manual coupe - and the cost of sports car rental tends to be astronomical. e.g. I rented a Porsche Cayman for a day and it cost me around $800 (and I didn't even get to go where I really wanted to in it). Our cars are as individual as we are and that's because we understand at a subconscious level that our car say a lot about us. Someone without a car is a bit of a loser in my book, someone who clearly doesn't get it. They also tend to ask for a lot of lifts. Someone without a car is a bit of a loser in my bookWell, that would include the vast majority of people living in Manhattan, not to mention many other high-density cities in Europe and Asia. Not everyone is in your situation, and that statement really highlights your prejudices. I've rented many cars, and it's gotten a lot easier over the years. Have you ever rented a Go-Get? It's almost easy as an Uber - a few taps on an app, and that car a few blocks away is yours for as long as you need it, at surprisingly cheap rates. As  more people choose rental over ownership, it keeps getting easier and cheaper. Even at $800/day, you could rent that Cayman for a lot of weekends for half the price of owning one (and maintaining and insuring it). You could also rent many different sports cars too, for variety - convertibles for summer, racers for track day, luxury sedans for the family road trip, while renting cheap trucks for when you need to just move stuff around. Even the fancy options will get cheaper, as the market for them increases. I'm not arguing that nobody should own cars - obviously that still makes a lot of sense for a lot of people, and there are many in Australia particularly who are very attached to theirs, as you say (I loved my Audi Quattro dearly). But it's a mistake to generalise that to everyone, and I think you'll find that the proportion of people who don't want or need a car of their own is growing faster than you suspect. Get what what you were saying but don't agree with the calling people losers who don't own cars. Yeah i love having my own car,being able to go where i want and when is great but like the person said before.\u000aPersonally I know a number of people in their 20s and 30s, even some in their 40s, who don't own a car and don't plan to - most can drive, but take PT, Uber, or Go-Get depending on their needs at the time. The majority of these could afford a car if they wanted to, but prefer to spend their money elsewhere, e.g. on better living, or travel. It seems likely to me that this number will only increase, even without self-driving cars to lower the costs of rides. People i know who live in the city don't have a car because they just use public transport ie trains, buses, trams, uber. The costs of maintaining a car, insurance, rego, green slips, services, breakdowns outweighs the benefit of having a car that you would only use when really needed. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 1:05 pm								 I love this!

Be brave to try before comment \U0001f914 I'm not interested in trying it, I like driving. In fact, it is probably the most enjoyable thing I get to do on a regular basis. If driverless cars became compulsory, I would emigrate to a country where I could still drive. I certainly don't care how safe it is because I never feel in danger when I'm on the road. Should subscribe to the Dashcams Australia page, the videos on there would definitely make you feel danger on the road with the amount of idiots you see. I just want a driverless car so I don't have to park in the city. I'll just make it drive round and round the block until I'm ready to go. I think both the article writers (us) and the commenters here and elsewhere are limited by the wordcount and online mediums and so generalizations are going to be almost unavoidable, this was also written in its original form for a fairly broad audience. You have to go to a engineering-style medium to get more gritty details e.g. https://sourceable.net/how-can-we-make-self-driving-cars-actually-happen/ That said, our primary purpose in doing these articles is to raise attention to what is going on - we are not trying to advocate for one party or the other. Most of the public doesn't yet have the awareness or discussion about this topic anything close to what you're seeing here in the comments section, and that's a problem - because *if* some of the things happen or more that we're alluding to in the article, or that commentators are raising in the comments (e.g. the corporate where does the money go question, here or overseas) we want to make sure the public is aware and responding well before it does.

VApple has set the date for its major product announcement event and the elusive iPhone 7 will most likely be revealed on the day. For Australians that want to be in on the action, here\u2019s how you can watch the keynote in the comfort of your own home.  This year\u2019s Apple keynote will be held on Wednesday, September 7, 10am Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) in San Francisco. That\u2019s Thursday, September 8, 3am when converted to Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST). Here are the date and times for each Australian capital city: Apple has made it easy for people to tune in on the event through a livestream. Here\u2019s a list of Apple devices supported and the minimum specification requirements to run the livestream: The Apple livestream website can be found here. If you don\u2019t have any of those Apple devices, don\u2019t panic. You can still access the livestream through the Microsoft Edge browser on a PC running Windows 10. If you\u2019re running an older version of Windows or if you don\u2019t want to use the Edge browser, there is a way to watch the livestream through VLC media player. Just launch VLC, click on Media and select Open Network Stream (the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl + N) and paste in the livestream URL, which will only be available once the show starts on the day, into the network URL field. Lifehacker Australia will be providing extensive coverage on the Apple event on the Thursday. Stay tuned! Reckon I'll just rely on Giz/LH's summary over breakfast. That's been my plan for the past few years I once got up and watched these press conferences .... that's when they were really innovative and exciting .... today, not so much, everything is either predicable or leaked in advance. People get up at 3am for these? Why? Just watch the summary video in the morning and come here for the text wrap-up. It's a wonder Apple don't charge for the privilege... maybe that's an upcoming "enhancement".  Surely there would be millions who would pay for it. They could maybe just force-stream it to all iDevices. Yeah, back when smartphone tech was new. Name any real big innovation in the smartphone market in the last few years.

V\u000aParents are leaving it too late to tackle the issue of online safety with their children which could be putting them at risk of danger. That\u2019s the main finding of a new YouGov survey commissioned by mobile phone provider O2 and the NSPCC. YouGov, which interviewed more than 2000 parents and children aged between the ages of eight and 13, found that although 91 per cent of eight year olds use the internet, most parents don\u2019t actually talk to them about online safety until they are at least nine \u2013 a delay that could be leaving children at risk from crimes such as cyber bullying and even online grooming. Nearly two fifths of parents (39%) felt that children under 10 would be too young to understand the issue while around one in four (26%) believed the nature of the conversation would scare or upset them too much. Interestingly though parents seem rather more keen to talk to children about everyday \u2018real world\u2019 issues such as stranger danger and bullying from the age of seven. Although a quarter (26%) of those parents who acknowledge feeling less confident about staying safe online because they don\u2019t have the technical knowledge to give their child practical advice, it\u2019s clear from the survey that the current generation of digital natives genuinely value guidance from their parents. Of the 1,000 children surveyed whose parents had ever talked to them about online safety, nearly two thirds (60%) said that they had modified their online behaviour as a result. Says Ronan Dunne, O2 CEO: \u201cWhile the internet is driving economic growth and positively transforming the way we live and work, the simple truth is that, like the \u2018offline\u2019 world, the online world comes with risks attached.\u201d Adds NSPCC chief executive, Peter Wanless: \u201cSadly we know that children up and down the country are struggling because of difficult experiences online. Thousands of young people contact us about issues such as online grooming, cyber bullying and after viewing sites which encourage eating disorders, self-harm and suicide. We need to ensure they are equipped with the necessary skills to protect themselves.\u201d The new partnership between O2 and the NSPCC is designed to give parents the tools, support and information they need to help their children explore the internet safely. The partnership includes a dedicated new joint helpline staffed by NSPCC-trained O2 tech-experts to give parents the technical advice they need to get the most out of the internet, including how to set privacy settings and parental controls.

Here are a few ways you can make your own puzzle feeders on the cheap.\u000a\u000aPhoto by Ian Ivesey. The folks at the Purina One cat blog have six different puzzle feeders you can easily build yourself with things around the house. You can make them out of an empty sour cream or cottage cheese container, an empty plastic water bottle, a plastic Easter egg, a shoe box, an egg carton or just some card-stock paper. The empty sour cream container feeder, called the \u201cwheel\u201d, just needs an extra plastic lid, some non-toxic glue and a sharp tool like a utility knife to assemble: As the study published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery explains, puzzle feeders like these engage the feline hunting instinct and force the cats to work for their food. This \u201cforaging\u201d behaviour makes the cat more physically active and helps reduce their stress level, which in turn makes them less demanding of you.

VStop-motion animation is one of the earliest forms of cinema and it\u2019s only thrived over time. But you can\u2019t really see how far we\u2019ve come without looking all the way back.  Vugar Efendi recently released a video called \u201cThe Evolution of Stop-Motion,\u201d showcasing 116 years of stop-motion in just under three minutes. It doesn\u2019t show the first credited example of stop-motion animation, Vitagraph\u2019s The Humpty Dumpty Circus in 1898, but it showcases some of stop-motion\u2019s earliest roots, like The Enchanted Drawing, through the most recent stop-motion works, like Kubo and the Two Strings.  For those who haven\u2019t seen Kubo yet, it\u2019s a technological marvel, representing just how far stop-motion animation has come in the past 100+ years. Animator Kevin Parry recently shared a GIF of some of the work he did bringing Kubo\u2019s grandfather-turned-dragon to life, and it\u2019s seriously impressive work. Plus, look at Kubo\u2019s sweet slide. That puppet\u2019s got skills. I\u2019m still waiting on Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s stop-motion adaption of Pinocchio, which has been loosely in the works since 2008. If you check out some of the designs and concept art, it looks absolutely gorgeous. Last we heard in July, Del Toro was penning a new draft of the script. [Nerdist] I remember going to see the original Tron - for the ground breaking [at the time] computer animation. Final Fantasy movie,  for same reason. Visually grand, but rather lacking in plot.

Justin Halls, Head of Product Marketing at Optoma, said: \u201cThe feedback received for the HD91 and its shorter throw version, the HD90, has been excellent so we\u2019re excited to unveil the next evolution of our LED home cinema projectors.\u201d The HD91+ offers 600,000:1 contrast ratio, increased brightness of 1,300 lumens and 1080p Full HD. Powered by three LEDs, the HD91+ delivers enhanced image quality with a wide colour gamut, superior colour saturation and outstanding brightness using separate red, blue and green LEDs. The LED illumination in the HD91+ provides consistent brightness and colour performance to maintain its out-of-the-box image quality throughout its lifetime, claims Optoma. LEDs have up to 33% less power consumption than an equivalent lamp-based projector and need less cooling, which makes the projector almost silent in operation and allows more flexibility in installation. Since its launch, the HD91 home cinema projector received numerous awards and accolades, including a Highly Recommended award from AVForums.com.

VWinter is over. Spring is here. Summer is fast approaching. And still, we have yet to see a trailer for Sony\u2019s Christmas sci-fi movie Passengers. This isn\u2019t some small movie either. It stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, plus the footage that was shown to exhibitors back in April looked amazing. The first poster has just made its way online, so hopefully that means Sony will release the trailer soon.\u000a\u000aHere\u2019s the poster for the movie, which is about what happens when two passengers on a space ship (Pratt and Lawrence) wake up 90 years before they\u2019re supposed to. The poster doesn\u2019t give away much information about the film, but that makes sense. Passengers stars two of the biggest actors in the world. The premise \u2014 cool as it may be \u2014 is secondary. That this is only the second piece of marketing we\u2019ve seen with three months until release, is pretty crazy though. Passengers, written by Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and directed by Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game), opens January 1. Odds are we\u2019ll get the first trailer in the next week or so. [Flickering Myth via ScreenCrush] "what happens when two passengers on a space ship (Pratt and Lawrence) wake up 90 years before they\u2019re supposed to." Spoiler alert!  They'll hate each other, save humanity, and fall in love in the process. There is an early version of the screenplay floating around online. It was a good story. Hopefully the final film is as good. you! bastard! you didnt even use the spoiler function in the comments section! ha ha ha didnt even know this movie existed. ill give it a bash, probably wait till it comes out on blu ray or streaming service though.

VI mean, it doesn\u2019t even bring you chilled drinks like the last crazily-priced Astromech.\u000a\u000aSideshow Collectibles has released more details about the gorgeous-looking lifesized Artoo it revealed in the run up to the Rogue One merchandise frenzy last week, and its doozy of a price tag. Clocking in at 1.2m tall, R2 doesn\u2019t actually do all that much \u2014 he\u2019s got a base designed to look like the floor of the Millennium Falcon, and from a remote control stored in one of his myriad tool panels you can control movie-authentic lights and sounds from the droid. Aside from a moveable dome, that\u2019s pretty much it \u2014 no R/C controls, nothing fancy coming out of his holoprojector, nothing. So you\u2019re essentially paying $US7450 ($9710) for the world\u2019s nerdiest plus-sized paperweight. It is a very pretty paperweight though. If you\u2019ve got the cash to spare (can I have some?), R2-D2 is available for pre-order now ahead of a release next winter. 9 grand? sorry but for that much, I oughta get the dwarf that just died!

VIt\u2019s not often that two major technology manufacturers hold a product launch on the same day \u2014 but that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening tomorrow morning. First, Apple will unveil its latest wares \u2014 including the iPhone 7 \u2014 at its 2016 keynote in San Francisco. Then, Sony will unveil its new super console, dubbed PS4 Neo, in New York City. If you care about consumer technology, this is definitely worth staying up for.  We can blame Apple for parking its keynote on the same day as Sony\u2019s Neo reveal \u2014 the Cupertino-based tech giant only announced the timing of its event this week. Thankfully, the events are scheduled a few hours\u2019 apart, so hopefully you won\u2019t need to stream both simultaneously.  Apple\u2019s 2016 Keynote begins September 8 at 3am Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST). You can also watch the official Apple livestream here. For more information on watching the event live in Australia, check out our in-depth guide. Following hot on the heels of Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 event will be Sony\u2019s press conference where we should get our first official glimpse of the Neo and Slim consoles. It\u2019s scheduled to start at 5am AEST. You can watch the live stream via PlayStation\u2019s LiveCast link or by following the announcements on the PlayStation AU Twitter page. (You can find more information here.) It\u2019s been a long while since a tech event has enticed us to wake up absurdly early outside of work demands. We think you\u2019ll agree that this double-pronged event should be worth it. In fact, we might just not go to bed at all. Who\u2019s with us? [A note to Adelaidians: the Viscous Coffee cafe now sells iced coffee with 80 times more caffeine than a shot of espresso. Hop to it!]     Yeahhhhh I'll be fine to wake up tomorrow morning and read the highlights... Android/Xbox One user here ;).   shots fired I do love tech, and that's the reason I don't buy apple products *zing* I love tech too, I also like getting value for money. Apple does not offer this, never have never will. Their marketing however is top notch great at getting people to buy into the illusion that they have a superior product when it's really just a pretty exterior with sub-par tech within. Apple have basically backed themselves into a corner with their premium branding and fear of self cannibalisation. They refuse to put touch screens on their laptops because they don't want to destroy their ipad market, so instead they released the ipad pro a sub par device no one wanted to compete with the surface pros.  I liked when apple were actually innovative because it makes the entire market better but they really have fallen on flat feet in recent years and are purely focused on pushing the limits on what they can charge for sub-par devices in a pretty chassis. You know your life's taken a sad turn when you're getting up early for product launches.

VIn an effort to rid the entire internet of the scourge that is pirated content, Warner Bros. has gotten a little heavy handed \u2014 including its own websites in a copyright complaint to Google.  Torrentfreak reports Warner Bros has submitted over four million URLs for review this year alone, on the back of pressure from film studios for Google to altogether remove sites like The Pirate Bay from search results.  Among those four million URLs were a number of sites not actually containing any illegally obtained content. Such as Warner Bros own site, for example, along side IMDB listings, and a link to Amazon where you can actually buy the films.  Oops. Ahhh. \u2026yeah. Warner Bros. utilised the services of Vobile to submit the copyright claims, a company who \u201coffers solutions to help content owners protect, measure and monetise movies and TV content across the Internet and on all screens\u201d. Google spotted the mistake and didn\u2019t take down the official IMDB and Amazon links, but the Warner Bros. links are still under review. Google being a little cheeky, perhaps? Take 'em down. Teach 'em a lesson. I agree.  Stupidity should have consequences. Its misuse of the DMCA, there are heavy fines for demanding non-infringing links be removed. Since when? What heavy fines? The closest I can see is that knowingly misrepresenting a link as infringing means you could be liable for any damages - should the other party decide to sue you in response, which is a considerably higher barrier than an automated takedown request. Takedown spam is nearly free, and nearly consequence-free too, since you can argue you didn't know your spam machine would make that particular mistake. Since the DMCA laws were passed.  You cant abuse the DMCA process, and there are meant to be protections to stop it happening. A DMCA notice is meant to have certain information in it to be valid. * contact information\u000a* the name of whats being breached\u000a* the web address of the copied song\u000a* a statement that he has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\u000a* a statement that the information in the notification is accurate\u000a* a statement that, under penalty of perjury, Charlie is authorized to act for the copyright holder\u000ahis signature Clearly they havent looked at the list, and hence wouldnt have looked at the site, so how do they demonstrate a good faith belief?  Its also clear its not accurate for similar reasons, and you might find the actual copyright for the page is held by the webpage designed anyway.  If so, thats perjury, which carries massive fines and jail time. So, the takedown request is flawed.  Its hard to find exactly what those penalties are to be fair, but one case I saw where a takedown was wrong got hit with a $25,000 default judgement.  Per offence, that adds up fast. They are there, but that doesnt mean they get applied very often.  Just extreme cases it seems where its delibrate.  It seems that its OK to accidentally abuse the system, which I expect is the point you're making.  As testing it is problematic, we might never know for sure. This exact issue was raised in court back in 2013, in Hotfile vs Warner.  Warner argued that their takedown mistakes were not deliberate, being made by a computer and not a person, and because the perjury clause only applied to deliberate misrepresentation of ownership, not to accuracy, it thus did not apply. They claimed good-faith belief in every takedown request, and that the occasional mistake did not preclude this. The judge was not entirely convinced, but the matter was eventually sealed as part of a settlement agreement. The EFF successfully got them unsealed in time, showing that Warner knew well that its automated systems were inaccurate. Despite this, Warner Bros were never sanctioned with any fines. There are no penalties described in the DMCA 512(f) clause, only a reference to liability, which thus requires (expensive) litigation to pursue. The $25K default judgement you describe was Wordpress suing a UK individual in a US court, who did not bother to turn up to defend himself - which is certainly not going to happen if you sue a megacorp like Warner Bros. My point here is while abuse of the DMCA can technically be penalised, the legal process for doing so is expensive and far from certain, especially if challenged. Compared to the ease of issuing automated takedowns, the DMCA is ridiculously one-sided, and even knowingly abusing the system is almost completely consequence-free, particularly for well-funded organisations with their own lawyers. Yeah, fair enough.  My point is there are rules there, and penalties, and yours is 'so what?' :)  Which is fair, they're only effective if they're enforced. I wonder why someone like the EFF doesnt push this though.  Find a bunny that doesnt have the firepower of a Sony or WB, and push that they dont meet the standards required for a valid takedown, solely because there is no 'good faith' application if there is no human oversight. They get away with automating the process, and as a result, force the recipients of the takedowns to automate their process as well.  In the end, people are guilty until proven innocent, and as is often the case, with no process to plead their innocence. Well, the rules don't apply to "inadvertent" inaccuracy (apparently even if the inaccuracies are well known), only to deliberate misrepresentation of ownership. So there are no rules that cover the bulk takedowns we're seeing. And there are no proscribed penalties either, even for deliberate misrepresentation. Instead there's liability for damages and costs, which has to be (expensively) argued in court, and could amount to very little beyond lawers' costs even if you win (as Wordpress found - they got less than $2k of their $25k payout, and the lawyers got the rest - assuming they ever managed to collect from the UK defendant). So (unlike regular spam) there's no real way to automate the response for recipients of inaccurate takedowns. The rules around inaccurate takedowns need to be beefed up considerably, with actual specified penalties that don't require extended litigation to debate. The Warner Bros sites should've been taken down, then had to go through a lengthy, drawn-out process of reinstating them. Human-free reporting and taking down of content should be banned. There's no screening for fair use otherwise, but that's exactly what Studios want. In keeping with the corporate identity established by zack Snyder's films, the legal department has been heavy handed. God, would have been funny seeing WB filing a lawsuit at WB for copyright trolling. Maybe if they put this much effort into actually making decent movies then more people would want to pay money to see it and copyright would go down.

VAudi\u2019s e-tron quattro concept car was unveiled in Germany. The manufacturer claims a range of 500 kilometres. Is Tesla about to have a rival in the luxury electric car market? Volkswagen\u2019s two premium flagship brands, Audi and Porsche, unveiled battery-powered sports cars at the Frankfurt auto show on Monday. Although neither car will be available to buy until around 2018, the launches are aimed at stealing attention from Tesla\u2019s first luxury electric crossover, the Model X, which is due to go on sale from Sept 29. Porsche showed the prototype of its first battery-powered sports car, titled \u201cMission E.\u201d Similar in appearance to its iconic 911, it has an 800-volt electric powertrain with 600 horsepower that can accelerate to 100 km per hour in 3.5 seconds. \u201cWhen we designed this car, we knew it had to be a real Porsche,\u201d chief executive Matthias Müller said in an interview on the eve of the Frankfurt Motor Show. \u201cIt had to feel like a 911.\u201d Porsche\u2019s Mission E a boasts over 500 km of range and is designed to be a little roomier than the 911. However, it probably won\u2019t go on the market until 2018-19. Audi said its e-tron quattro (pictured above) is to be launched by 2018 and would have over 500 km (311 miles) per charge. That compares with about 300 miles for Tesla\u2019s new Model S P90D saloon, which is already garnering good reviews in the press. The all-electric venture represents a change of course for Audi, which had previously focused on developing electric variants of existing models such as its two-seater R8 sports car rather than committing to serial production like German rival BMW with its \u201ci\u201d brand electric series. The impact the announcement on Tesla is not clear cut, according to analysts. As two of the world\u2019s most sought-after car brands, they represent serious competition for the attention of well off, environmentally conscious buyers. But they also boost the credibility of the all-electric market, which could help Tesla in the long run. The Nissan Leaf is currently the UK\u2019s top selling electric car, although a total of just 6,838 of the battery powered LEAF electric cars were sold in UK in 2014 (compared to 5,273 for the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV and 1,534 for the BMW i3).     Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VHP ENVY Phoenix: the VR desktop PC designed for gamers On display at CES this week is a new virtual reality (VR) ready desktop PC, the HP ENVY Phoenix. Designed for gamers, the new PC powers Vive, the new VR system from HTC. This delivers an  immersive VR experience with room scale tracking capabilities, combined with photosensors on the headset and controllers, to track a user\u2019s movement within a 3D space. Together, the Vive by HTC and HP\u2019s VR-ready ENVY Phoenix provide the most immersive room scale VR solution available today, claims HP. \u201cAs virtual reality becomes the next wave of innovation for gaming, customers need a desktop PC specifically configured with quality, performance and computing power to enable the experience,\u201d says Kevin Frost, vice president and general manager, consumer personal systems, HP Inc. \u201cHP is excited to be working with HTC to be at the forefront of this new technology to deliver the HP ENVY Phoenix, a purpose built desktop PC to power amazing virtual gaming experiences.\u201d Through its collaboration with HTC, HP will deliver a gaming tower PC that addresses the key issues that impede on a great experience. By testing each configuration against Vive by HTC to optimise for VR, HP and HTC are resolving graphic cards issues to ensure the correct resolution is assigned and detected in the settings when connected to Vive by HTC and that the graphics driver recognises the headset as a secondary display. HP is also optimising driver performance and the power profile in order for gamers to achieve the most performance without having to adjust their power to High Performance. \u201cHTC and HP are collaborating to test and optimise hardware to ensure a great customer experience when using HP technology with Vive by HTC,\u201d says Dan O\u2019Brien, vice president, HTC. \u201cBy testing against the most intensive games on the market, HP and HTC are pushing hardware to the limits to enable constant frame rates for smooth and glitch-free virtual gaming experiences.\u201d The HP ENVY Phoenix now offers a special configuration to make it the most VR-tuned consumer desktop by HP for gamers who are at the forefront of virtual reality gaming and want a painless out-of-the-box experience. On board is a 2 TB hard drive so the HP ENVY Phoenix can host a massive amount of large format VR games, videos and short animations. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s a 128GB SSD to allow for rapid data access so users don\u2019t have to wait for games and videos to load. To tackle all CPU processing needs for VR, the HP ENVY Phoenix comes with Intel® CoreTM i7 K-series processors with overclocking capabilities. For the best VR experience, the HP ENVY Phoenix gives customers an NVIDIA GTXTM  980 Ti  graphics card in order to minimise latency between rendering of each frame. The powerful CPU is needed in order to make sure that all of the body tracking is done quick enough in order to allow the GPU to be fed the correct information about where to render the frame in order to match the location of the user\u2019s head. VR is CPU intensive so to manage the heat the HP ENVY Phoenix uses liquid cooling, an advanced thermal system, to keep it running quiet and cool. It also boasts customisable LED lighting tied to the CPU temperature so users can be aware of how the tower PC is running especially when it is overclocking. The HP ENVY Phoenix is expected to be available in the UK in February. Pricing will be announced closer to product availability. Vive BY HTC is sold separately.

VResearchers from Rice University say that around 4.4 billion years ago, a Mercury-like planet smashed into Earth, seeding our primordial planet with life-giving carbon. Had this never occurred, it\u2019s an open question as to whether or not life could have ever emerged.\u000a\u000aImage by A. Passwaters/Rice University/NASA/JPL-Caltech Geoscientists have struggled to explain how life was able to arise on Earth given that most of the planet\u2019s carbon \u2014 an important prerequisite for life \u2014 should have either boiled away during the planet\u2019s earliest stages or become trapped within the Earth\u2019s core. By conducting high-pressure and high-temperature experiments in the lab, researchers from Rice University have concluded that virtually all of our planet\u2019s carbon likely arrived when a Mercury-like planet smashed into the young Earth some 4.4 billion years ago. Scientists aren\u2019t entirely sure how Earth\u2019s volatile elements, such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur, were able to remain outside the Earth\u2019s core and stay locked within the mantle. Models show that most of our planet\u2019s carbon should have vaporised into space, or ended up in the metallic core of our planet, sucked up by its iron-rich alloys. Prior to the new study, many scientists speculated that these volatile elements came to Earth after our planet\u2019s core finished forming. As Rice University geoscientist and study co-author Yuan Li pointed out in a statement, \u201cAny of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the solar system formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point.\u201d Trouble is, there are no known meteorites capable of producing the required ratio of volatile elements. Three years ago, Li and his colleagues began to take a different approach to the problem. They conducted a series of experiments to assess how carbon\u2019s affinity for iron may have been altered by other compounds present in the Earth\u2019s early environment. Importantly, they considered the potential role of other celestial bodies with characteristically different chemical compositions. \u201cWe thought we definitely needed to break away from the conventional core composition of just iron and nickel and carbon,\u201d noted study co-author Rajdeep Dasgupta. \u201cSo we began exploring very sulphur-rich and silicon-rich alloys, in part because the core of Mars is thought to be sulphur-rich and the core of Mercury is thought to be relatively silicon-rich.\u201d The proposed collision was so intense that Earth essentially absorbed the incoming proto-planet. (Image: Rajdeep Dasgupta) Their experiments recreated the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions found deep inside the Earth and other rocky planets. Results showed that carbon could be excluded from the core and relegated to the Earth\u2019s mantle, provided that the iron alloys in the core were rich in either silicon or sulphur. One scenario that explains this particular ratio is that an embryonic planet \u2014 one that already formed a silicon-rich core \u2014 slammed into Earth, and was absorbed by Earth. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth\u2019s mantle,\u201d said Gupta. The researchers say this collision likely happened about 4.4 billion years ago, which is only about 150 to 200 million years after the Earth formed. With carbon locked within the crust, and with the planet settling down to produce habitable conditions, life soon emerged. Indeed, the most recent estimates suggest that microbial life formed approximately 4.1 billion years ago. It\u2019s important to point out that evidence for this primordial collision is circumstantial as best. The researchers agree that more work is needed to support this theory, including analyses of abundant elements other than carbon. If true, however, it could mean that Earth only became a habitable oasis only after this tremendous cosmic smashup. Carbon forms a key component of all known life on Earth; complex molecules are comprised of carbon bonded with other elements, such as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen. Regardless, the theory makes you wonder about life on other planets, and how specific the conditions need to be for life to finally emerge on dead, rocky worlds. [Nature Geoscience] Ah yes, the First Impact. It could be that the right sort of planet has to be orbiting the right sort of star in the so called goldilocks zone and must be hit with another space body made of the right stuff, causing the impacted planet to spin like earth does and also creating a moon of the right size, density and distance from the planet it orbits in order for there to be life. If so, that puts the odds significantly against life being elsewhere. Maybe it was actually Mercury that hit us... Like sperm to an egg

VLast week, Samsung recalled roughly 2.5 million smartphones after it was discovered that at least 35 of the devices had spontaneously burst into flames. Make that 35 and counting. But don\u2019t worry, if you\u2019d like to bring your Galaxy Note 7 onto a flight in the US, the FAA still hasn\u2019t decided whether it should ban the devices on planes. The agency is thinking about it, however.\u000a\u000aSamsung Galaxy Note 7 after sustaining fire damage from its battery (Twitter) Gizmodo reached out to the FAA, TSA and major US airlines this weekend about whether they will restrict the devices from being carried onto flights. Tonight, the FAA finally told us that it\u2019s still working on exploring the issue but that no final decision has been made. Any official recall for a battery-powered device like this could mean that the devices wouldn\u2019t be allowed on future flights. \u201cThe FAA and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration are working on guidance related to this issue,\u201d an FAA spokesperson told Gizmodo over email. \u201cIf the device is recalled by the manufacturer, airline crew and passengers will not be able to bring recalled batteries or electronics that contain recalled batteries in the cabin of an aircraft, or in carry-on and checked baggage.\u201d If this sounds confusing, that\u2019s because it is. Samsung has already \u201crecalled\u201d the Galaxy Note 7, but the South Korean company hasn\u2019t actually recalled it the right way in the US. The proper way to institute a recall is to get the US Consumer Product Safety Commission involved from the beginning. Samsung didn\u2019t do that. And now, US federal agencies like the FAA are left scrambling and days behind, trying to figure out what to do. Samsung has sold about one million Galaxy Note 7 devices worldwide since the new model\u2019s introduction in August, and it\u2019s voluntarily recalling about 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 devices that have been produced. Samsung is offering consumers refunds and a replacement product that the company says should be available in a few weeks. But the devices are still for sale in some retail outlets around the United States since Samsung didn\u2019t initiate an official recall with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. When reached for comment in the past few days none of the major US-based airlines had any plans to ban the phones. Alaska Airlines, Southwest Airlines and American Airlines told Gizmodo that they did not have any specific plans to ban the Galaxy Note 7 on their flights. Other major airlines didn\u2019t return our messages, presumably because \u201cnew phone who dis?\u201d But a ban from the FAA \u2014 should that come to pass \u2014 would be observed by all the airlines. In late 2015, the FAA banned so-called hoverboards, the self-balancing scooters that became infamous for containing batteries that would overheat and literally burst into flames. The hoverboards were restricted from flights, prompting notable hotheads like Russell Crowe to figuratively burst into flames. It\u2019s not clear how a hypothetical ban on a specific model of phone would be enacted. Would TSA agents look at each phone very carefully? One imagines it wouldn\u2019t be that much harder than making sure your toothpaste is in a 100g tube rather than a 110g tube. Your potentially explosive Galaxy Note 7 is still welcome on all US flights, both domestic and international, as far as the FAA and major US airlines are concerned. At least for now, it is. But please remember that your 110g container of toothpaste is a danger to everyone on board. There have been precisely zero cases of toothpaste containers spontaneously bursting into flames in the past month, to our knowledge, but you can never be too careful. Flight from Brisbane to Sydney last night, announcement made over the plane PA stating that no Samsung Note 7 phones were allowed to be charged on board. A couple of annoyed looking suits in my row. Even if they decide to "ban" a particular device it'll be impossible to enforce on a practical level - training the various personnel involved on how to identify a single handset model (or set of country-specific variants) ain't gonna work. Even if they're not in protective cases.\u000aThe only way they could reliably do it is to ban all such devices. That would be unpopular I guess. And have to have exclusions for the iPads some flightdeck crew use.\u000aI'd expect to see passenger advisory notices for a while, but nothing more. sorry, read comment wrong. Yes you are right. How would staff know? They're all black rectangles of glass \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 2:33 pm								 Wow, thats a bit racist. . \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 4:36 pm

VForget fancy cameras in your iPhone, or iOS 10, or the lack of a headphone jack. The real thing to celebrate out of today\u2019s iPhone 7 announcement is the end of the piddly arse 16 gigabyte iPhone. That dreaded \u201cout of storage warning\u201d will now be a thing of the past\u2026 at least until you load up your 32GB iPhone with millions of videos of your cat doing something cute.\u000a\u000aIllustration by: Sam Woolley The new iPhone 7 models will start at 32GB. Sure, Apple will still be selling older models at the 16GB entry point, but the company\u2019s started down the road of slowly moving away from 16GB. An acknowledgement that for years this has been regressive and stupid. Apple was the last major holdout on the 16GB front. Other smartphone makers with finite amounts of storage in their phones have long since moved onto larger pastures. Even phones with expandable storage, like those from LG and Samsung, left the 16GB storage option in the dust. Apple held that tiny, overpriced hill all its own, charging Apple iPhone 6s users a minimum $1079 for the privilege of having a phone capable of storing no more than a year\u2019s worth of apps and photographs. If you wanted to save cash you could spring for the cheaper 16GB iPhone SE. But still, a 16GB phone is total lunacy. Who would make such a thing? Remember, this wasn\u2019t even really 16GB. Your available storage dropped when all the required apps and operating system were crammed in, and it dropped further when you were forced to download a new OS update \u2014 which often consumed gigabytes of storage. Things got worse when you made the decision to add your own apps, many of which have seen their size balloon over the last few years. And then photos. How dare you take photos. Like 8GB before it, 16GB just hasn\u2019t been cutting it as a minimum size for an iPhone. But now the 16GB iPhone is dead, and the 32GB iPhone has come to take its place as the entry point. Celebrate the death of the 16GB waste of cash by not making the same mistake many storage hungry iPhone users make. Splurge a little and get the bigger phone. You\u2019ll appreciate it sooner than you think.

You get kickbacks from the memory mfr's. association? 16 GB is plenty for people who just buy a phone to have a phone and don't need a surrogate for playing with themselves. The 128gb current model is almost $500 more than the 16gb, I wonder how much the 256gb new one will cost? I would still like to see 16gb phones for the users who just don't need the storage. Where I work, they have decided to use iPhones only for the work mobile. Over half of the phones only require 16gb of storage. 16GB iPad Air 2  is also no longer on offer. 32GB is cheaper than the 16 was. Same for the ex 64 (now 128). what if apple phones only came in one size 32gb and if you wanted more drive space you could simply side in a card to expand the drive space...  you know like many android devices have

p456
VThe Internet of Things is in the sea. More specifically, it\u2019s in an Oyster farm in Hobart. And we have The Yield, Microsoft, Bosch and Intel to thank. Oysters are filter animals, taking in whatever \u2014 good or bad \u2014 is in the water. If there\u2019s been a lot of rain flooding into the estuaries where oysters grow, they can quickly pick up contaminants that could make you very, very sick. Farmers and regulators obviously want to avoid that at all costs \u2014 and so when there is even the slightest risk, oyster farms have to close until conditions improve. Mortality Syndrome is a disease which affects Pacific Oysters, and has been causing havoc in the Tasmanian oyster industry \u2014 where losing a day\u2019s harvest can mean a loss of $120,000 in revenue. Barilla Bay Oysters, for example, lost 70 percent of its harvest to the disease in February, crippling its operations. Until now there has been a reliance on rainfall gauges to assess risk, and the results are often inaccurate \u2014 around 30 per cent of closures based on rainfall gauge readings are in fact unwarranted \u2014 the water quality and the oysters are actually fine. So there\u2019s a problem. You don\u2019t want to make people sick with dodgy oysters, but you also don\u2019t want to lose $120,000 a day in revenue. Technology to the rescue! Ag-tech business The Yield, working with Microsoft, Intel and Bosch is getting deep into data to better predict Mother Nature\u2019s effect on Oyster yields. Along with the Tasmanian Government and oyster farmers in 14 of the State\u2019s estuaries, The Yield is deploying a new system that kicks the rainfall gauge to the curb, using in-estuary sensors, cloud computing and machine learning. It works by relaying data from in-estuary sensors via an Intel gateway to Bosch\u2019s ProSyst software, where it is then ingested into Microsoft\u2019s IoT hub in the Microsoft Azure cloud alongside national weather data.  Environmental data and near real time sensor data is combined and presented to oyster growers and regulators so they can make more accurate decisions faster. They\u2019ve made it look pretty, too. There are dashboard visualisations for the previous week, for today and for tomorrow. Microsoft Azure Machine Learning is used to drive the predictive algorithms for the app. While salinity measurement is clearly important in terms of identifying contamination risks, water temperature is equally critical in order to assess the risk of the POMS virus which can devastate oyster farms unless effectively managed. And, knowing that there is bad weather ahead, when it might be hard for crews to get out in the boats to harvest oysters, means oyster farmers are able to fine tune their rosters \u2014 again shaving cost and boosting efficiencies. Ros Harvey, founder and CEO of The Yield explains that the underlying technologies could also have much broader implications for farming generally \u2014 for example allowing crop growers to know exactly when and how to irrigate. \u201cWe actually have a really clear purpose which is how we\u2019re going to help feed the world without wrecking the planet,\u201d she says. To do that farmers and industry regulators need access to accurate, reliable and current data to support their decision making. The Yield\u2019s technology gives growers new insight so that they can make better decisions faster. Harvey says that Australia has a very strong global reputation for both agricultural innovation and food quality and safety. To maintain and grow that reputation, and also tackle some of the high costs associated with farming in Australia, she believes it is essential to make better use of smart technologies and data collected at every stage of the farming process. While the initial deployment of the solution, which integrates technology from Bosch, Microsoft and Intel, has been focused on the oyster industry, Harvey says that its platform technology has been designed for the much broader agriculture and aquaculture market. To support the diverse application of its solutions The Yield has built application programming interfaces to its platform to allow researchers to take data feeds that can build knowledge and also provide a rapid pathway to commercialisation. While based in Australia, The Yield has global ambitions. Using Microsoft\u2019s Cloud as the technology foundation for the system will allow the solution to be rolled out internationally. And while it may never tame Mother Nature, it may help the world\u2019s farmers at least understand her moods. Great article. Innovation in Australia deserves to be supported. Bosch tipped in $2.5 million. The federal government tipped in $957,000. Maybe some support on broadband infrastructure might help. Ms Ros Harvey, Founder and Managing Director of The Yield, spoke very well on this recently at the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering. There is an article at the ATSE website from 15 June 2016, filed under agriculture, titled "Profiting in agriculture from the Internet of Things" Yeah nah can't do that mate, gotta get me some coal profits. Interwebs is fast enough now to check my email once a week.

p460
VVideo: Some movie scenes are unforgettable, and Steven Spielberg\u2019s reenactment of the Normandy Landing is one of them. Every shot feels chaotic, with indiscriminate bloodshed consistent with this brutal event. But as Nerdwriter1 explains in the video below, Spielberg\u2019s filmmaking choices are anything but random.\u000a\u000aFor starters, he\u2019s a student of history. In order to capture the feeling of being in the midst of battle, Spielberg borrows techniques from actual World War II footage. The main takeaways include keeping the camera low to the ground and introducing shake during running sequences and after explosions. A wandering frame in the midst of mass death would be effective in some sense, but Spielberg comes from the tradition of blockbusters, where intention has to be balanced with audience comprehension. For this reason, he shoots the scene from three perspectives: As the Allied troops on the ground, as the Axis troops above and following Tom Hanks. The camera pans, tilts and zooms between their perspective \u2014 instead of cutting \u2014 in order to keep viewers aware of where they are and who they\u2019re supposed to be looking at. (Anyone who has watched a more modern action movie knows how jarring a cut-heavy action sequence can be.) There\u2019s much more to this, so here\u2019s Nerdwriter1\u2019s analysis in detail:  There\u2019s a reason this scene resonates with audiences almost 20 years after its release, and it\u2019s because of a meticulous attention to detail, beneath the chaos. That scene ranks as one of my most memorable cinema experiences. Not quite the impact at home, but still good. Now give me a similar scene shot in 360° from the squad perspective that I can watch in VR. The scene, and the film in general also has a big impact because of it's use of a hi-shutter speed technique. By filming with a higher shutter speed, normal motion blur is limited, and everything looks really crisp and raw, almost strobing, and also gives a feeling of things happening quicker. this effect increases the intensity, and was also used a lot in the film '300'. if there's a stream of blood, we start to see individual droplets and makes it all the more intense. hi-shutter speed techniques weren't a new effect back then, but because of the films impact , the technique is often referred to as 'the private ryan video' effect. Have to admit, I've never seen the movie.  As someone with a nervous disorder, it just doesn't seem like something I'd have a positive reaction to. However, I DID play Medal of Honour: Allied Assault back in the day.  I believe this scene heavily influenced one of the levels in the game.  Back then, I wasn't diagnosed and symptoms had only just begun to show - it took me several weeks to push through the level, playing a few minutes at a time until I couldn't handle it any more, only to return to it a couple of days later. It was painful, and debilitating, and enormously memorable.  One hell (literally) of an experience.

p462
VToday, Apple hit the stage to announce the new iPhone 7, which features a fancy new camera and a water resistant enclosure. They also made a bunch of other announcements, from a new Apple Watch to the death of the headphone jack. If you didn\u2019t feel like wasting hours watching their press conference, here\u2019s everything you need to know.\u000a The new iPhone 7 sports a slightly new look and comes in two new colours, a matte black and a glossy black. The new enclosure makes the iPhone 7 water and dust resistant. It also gives the iPhone 7 space for stereo speakers, one on the top and another on the bottom. The speakers include an increased dynamic range, which should help improve the sound. Aside from the overall look, the home button gets its first major redesign too. The home button will support force-touch like gestures due to the \u201cTaptic engine\u201d. Apple didn\u2019t go into much detail about what you\u2019d do with this, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the impact of a new home button will actually be. As you\u2019d expect, the processor in the iPhone 7 was also updated. It\u2019s called A10 Fusion, which promises to be faster than the 6s. More importantly, it\u2019s a four-core processor that features two low-power cores that should help improve battery life. Apple\u2019s promising the longest battery life of any iPhone, claiming that it\u2019s about two hours longer than the iPhone 6s. The iPhone 7 ups the storage to 32GB, 128GB and 256GB, and the pricing remains the same as previous models, starting at $1079 for the 32GB. The iPhone 7 Plus starts at $1269 for the 32GB. Preorders start September 9. The new design comes with one massive change though. The rumours about Apple ditching the 3.5 mm stereo headphone jack are true. The iPhone 7 only has a lightning port with no headphone jack. This means new lighting-based Apple EarPods will come packed in the box alongside an adaptor so you can awkwardly use your old 1/8\u2033 headphones. Whether other smartphone manufacturers follow suit is yet to be seen. More info here. The camera in the iPhone 7 got a big bump. This includes optical image stabilisation, a wide f/1.8 aperture lens that lets in 50 per cent more light than the iPhone 6s, a 12MP camera and a high-speed processor that\u2019s faster than previous versions. Apple suggests this improves low-light photos, adds a wider colour gamut and improves live photos. The front camera gets a boost to 7MP and includes the image same stabilisation as the front. The iPhone 7 Plus adds a second camera to the mix. The second camera is a telephoto lens meant to improve zoom. That includes a 2x optical zoom and up to 10x digital zoom. The iPhone 7 Plus also gets a new depth of field shooting capability that uses both cameras alongside advanced machine learning on the camera chip itself to create a bokeh effect on portraits, though it won\u2019t be available at launch. There\u2019s a lot of hype behind what the iPhone 7 Plus camera can do, but we\u2019ll have to see how it actually works in the real world after launch. Apple announced its new wireless headphones, called Apple AirPods. These wireless headphones look a lot like Apple EarPods, but, well, without wires. They feature a five-hour battery life, accelerometers, microphones, Siri integration and are supposedly easy to connect to the iPhone 7. Whether they\u2019re iPhone-specific or will use Bluetooth to connect remains to be seen. They will launch in October for the premium price of $229. iOS 10, which packs a ton of new features including a brand new lock screen and a bunch of little tweaks to the Messages app, will arrive next Tuesday, September 13. The Apple Watch is getting its first hardware update, dubbed the Apple Watch Series 2. This version\u2019s big feature is a waterproof rating that makes it possible to take your watch for a swim. The hardware gets an update too. Now it includes a dual-core processor, a faster GPU, a new display and the feature people have been asking for since launch: Built-in GPS. This makes it so you can use it as a fitness watch without connecting it to your phone. Speaking of which, there\u2019s also now a special version of the watch that\u2019s a collaboration with Nike meant specifically for runners. The Apple Watch Series 2 will launch at $529 on September 16. The original Apple Watch drops to $399 and gets the same dual-core processor, but still doesn\u2019t have the GPS inside. Most importantly, Niantic took the stage to announce that Pokemon GO will arrive on the Apple Watch at some point before the end of the year, and will connect to your iPhone to show you when eggs hatch, Pokemon are nearby and when PokeStops are close (and let you spin them). iWork will roll out updates to its desktop and mobile apps that allows for real-time collaborative editing. This brings it in line features that have been in Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365 for a quite a while. Finally, Shigeru Miyamoto of Nintendo came out on stage to announce a new Mario game, an endless runner called Super Mario Run, specifically for the iPhone. It will be released this spring, with pricing details to be announced soon, but the assurance that it will be a one-time purchase with no in-app transactions. Kotaku has details. They feature a five-hour battery life I don't / have never had any wireless headphones, so I have no context to compare that to.  How does it stack up to other wireless products on the market? Seems ... I dunno, awfully low. You couldn't even fly from Brisbane to Perth on that charge. Is about the same as other similar products already on the market. They have to compromise  size, weight and battery life. As they recharge when you put them back in the case I guess they figure they've put enough battery in.\u000aOther than flighting, I'd guess few people have earbuds in for that length of time without a break. Thanks! Yeah I was trying to think of times when I have earbuds in without a break and it's pretty much just when I'm at work... In which case they're plugged in to my PC and not my phone. For what it's worth, @phil is right that they are about the same as similar products (i.e., individual buds rather than connected by a wire). The only other ones I know of like that are the Samsung IconX, and that battery life is <4hours. That said, most high-quality in-ear bluetooth headphones last 8-10hours and can be picked up for <$200. I'm guessing they would also be significantly harder to lose (since most have some sort of behind the neck cord). I'm not sure what the justification for buying the apple ones is. The only other ones I know of like that are the Samsung IconX, and that battery life is <4hours\u000athere's a few others - Bragi, Kanoa and one whose name escapes me at the moment, but has some red in its design It does depend though - I have wireless over-ear cans that last more like 12-14 hours on a single charge, but obviously size matters and not everyone wants to look like a Cyberman. Depending on the connectivity of the headphones, I don't believe you can use Bluetooth on a flight anyway?  For the size of these headphones, I reckon 5 hours isn't too bad. I was just using it as a comparison because it's a known quantity (5.5 hours flight time.) It's like the old comparison with MP3 players (store 100 CDs worth of music / 60 hours) - something tangible to make the analogy real.  So by the same token "you couldn't even drive from Melbourne to Canberra on that charge" (6hr 41mins according to Google) "Revolutionary new iPhone from 2012"\u000abeing sold at 2017 prices... Enjoy iDiots Apple's new marketing ploy to have people buy a whole new generation of "air" style headphones. As mentioned in other comments, it is truly hubristic of Apple to not allow people to charge and output from the device at the same time. They know that the cultish fans will just accept it, buy replacement Apple adapters and new "Air" style headphones. Apple will make a massive margin on this new accessories, the cultish fans will soon forget and have their pockets lightened for the privilege. Apple will become more arrogant knowing they can push any old swill to the consumer and they will lap it up. Apple foremost a marketing business; tech comes along for the ride as an afterthought. people can charge and output at the same time. they can output to wireless. or, if wired is that important, buy a device with better audio anyway.\u000amoving to a more versatile better connector (even if proprietary) seems like a good thing for those that need it. And they are, after all, in business. And businesses tend to want to make money.\u000aI'll not be their customer, but it will be interesting to see if apple's changes help push better/more uptake of wireless audio. I realise they are in business. I made a point of stating I believe they are foremost a marketing business. I have no issue with a new versatile connector. But the lack of redundancy for the universal 3.5mm jack is pure arrogance.  So if I am reading you correctly, you are suggesting that people should just throw away their current headphones and other attachments. Interesting. Nope you read incorrectly. If potential customers are unable/unwilling to ditch current headphones and move on then they can either use the supplied adaptor or choose a handset more appropriate for their needs. Simple. No worries. So they buy an adapter for $50 from Apple and what do they do when they need their powerbank connected while listening on along haul flight, stuck te airport, or delayed in some way. Arrogant Apple could have left the 3.5mm jack for a generation but they decided to just screw over their customers instead.

VThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were officially revealed by Apple this morning. While both models are similar to last year\u2019s iterations, they do usher in a handful of significant changes \u2014 not all of which are good. Here\u2019s all the new stuff you need to know about.    Has there really never been a black iPhone before now? Apparently so. Alongside the usual silver, gold and rose gold variants, you can now choose between a matte black or glossy black finish. On the downside, the elegant \u2018space gray\u2019 option is no more. Sniff. Finally! The Apple iPhone 7 sports an improved enclosure that\u2019s dust and water resistant. (Rated IP67 under IEC standard 60529.) While you won\u2019t be able to use it underwater like some flagship Androids, at least you don\u2019t need to freak out if it falls into the toilet. (Well, apart from the poo and wee.) This was a long overdue feature so not worth crowing about. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sport a faster, four-core processor dubbed the A10 Fusion. It features two low-power cores that should help to improve overall performance and battery life (more on which below.) According to Apple, it\u2019s the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. It boasts 64-bit architecture and an embedded M10 motion coprocessor. Apple reckons its \u201ctwice as fast\u201d as the iPhone 6\u2019s chip, whatever that means. At the very least, it should be speedier and more reliable when running graphically taxing applications. If Apple can be believed, the iPhone 7 will have the longest battery life of any iPhone. It purportedly beats the iPhone 6s by around two hours. Let\u2019s hope it also charges properly, eh? Both new iPhone models come equipped with LCD Retina displays much like the iPhone 6s. However, the screens are now 25 per cent brighter and purportedly boast a wider colour gamut. The iPhone 7 has a native resolution of 1334×750 pixels. The iPhone 7 Plus: 1920×1080 pixels. Apple\u2019s redesigned 12-megapixel cameras are arguably the iPhone 7\u2019s biggest claim to fame. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus now come with optical image stabilisation and an f/1.8 aperture lens for improved low-light photography. Apple has also reworked the flash to make it brighter and able to capture truer tones. Additionally, there have been some tweaks to its image processor for better editing. In exciting news for serious mobile photographers, the new OS ushers in RAW photos for the first time ever. The front-facing camera is better too, boasting a 7-megapixel sensor in place of the iPhone 6s\u2019 5-MP offering: selfie fans take note. 4K video recording, meanwhile, remains unchanged at 30 fps. The iPhone 7 Plus ups the ante further with dual cameras, one of which boasts a telephoto lens. This means that zoomed in images should be much clearer than before. According to Apple, the dual camera employs machine learning to create a depth map. After selecting the camera app\u2019s new \u201cportrait\u201d mode, you\u2019ll immediately see the depth effect in real time. You can also zoom 2x instantly with the tap of a button. We\u2019ve yet to test these phones\u2019 photographic capabilities, but it\u2019s safe to assume they will remain at the top of their field.  The patented Apple iPhone home button has received its first major redesign since the original hit stores almost a decade ago. The new, pressure-sensitive home button will support force-touch like gestures. It\u2019s also customisable.   There are three storage options for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. Yes, the 16GB model is no more. This is bad news for cash-strapped Apple fans who are desperate to save a few bucks, but it\u2019s good news for everybody else. As we\u2019ve been saying for some time now, there\u2019s no place for 16GB in a modern smartphone lineup \u2014 especially when you\u2019re forced to pay for additional cloud storage. We aren\u2019t sad to see it go. The iPhone finally boasts proper stereo speakers; one on the top and another on the bottom. The new speaker system includes an increased dynamic range, which should help improve the sound. There\u2019s also a greater emphasis on wireless audio, with Apple unveiling an interesting pair of Bluetooth-enabled \u201cAirPods\u201d (sold separately) which will last up to five hours on a single charge. According to Apple, the speakers\u2019 audio output is twice as loud as the maximum volume of the iPhone 6s. This is bound to come in handy if you lose your Lightning-to-3.5mm headphone jack adapter. Which brings us to this\u2026 Yes, really. Apple thinks it\u2019s time to move on from the 3.5mm headphone jack if we want to get more innovation in headphone design and improve audio quality. Instead, iPhone 7 users will need to rely on Bluetooth headsets, Lightning-based headphones or use a Lightning to audio adaptor to listen to music or make hands-free calls.  \u201cThe reason to move on comes down to one word \u2014 courage,\u201d Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller explained onstage. \u201cThis is really important, our smartphones are packed with technologies\u2026it\u2019s all fighting for space. Maintaining an ancient analogue connector doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d To its credit, Apple is including a Lightning-to-3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the box, but this is an extra doodad you now need to carry around. A bitter pill to swallow. You can read more about the ditched audio jack here.  At 7.1mm, the iPhone 7 is actually the same thickness as the iPhone 6s. This is curious when you consider the headphone jack was supposedly ditched to allow a thinner design. Hmmm.  And there you have it. It\u2019s not the most revolutionary upgrade we\u2019ve seen from Apple, but there can be little doubt that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will please the majority of iOS users. The only real fly in the ointment is the missing 3.5mm audio jack. If you already own a good pair of Bluetooth headphones this probably won\u2019t bother you, but we imagine many consumers are going to be peeved off. The included adaptor looks very easy to lose \u2014 and we doubt Apple will be handing out free replacements.  What are your thoughts on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? Is the deliberate killing off of the 3.5mm headphone standard a bridge too far, or do you consider it a necessary sacrifice? Share your views in the comments. Has there really never been a black iPhone before now? Apparently so.  My black iPhone 4 begs to differ... So does my iPhone 3G So does my.... wait.... was that sarcasm???? iPhone 7 dimensions: same thickness\u000aAt 7.1mm, the iPhone 7 is actually the same thickness as the iPhone 6s. This is curious when you consider the headphone jack was supposedly ditched to allow a thinner design. Hmmm. Ahhh... maybe they didn't slim it down any further because they used the extra space to increase the battery size ever so slightly? And the new camera clearly doesn't allow things to be any thinner (hence the protrusion)... \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 11:34 am								 oops, dupe \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 11:33 am								 Where is the real incremental value of iPhone seven over iPhone 6? I don't quite get it why I should bother to upgrade. Too bad. There's always next years! It's supposedly going to be a different design! "Maintaining an ancient analogue connector doesn\u2019t make sense" i can kinda get on board with this, but replacing it with something non universal (ie lightning) is annoying as hell :( Yeah an analogue connector for an analogue output is kinda weird. Stereo? Wow, I've had stereo on my HTC Android phone for............ a very long time.  Well, what can I say? The iPhone has just moved past 2010, into 2011. It's catching up with - no, it's not. Sorry, my mistake - I nearly fell for the Apple hype, it's still more of the same old old old old................. Yeah 750p screen and 2000mah battery in 2016! Lol! At some point you have to convert digital to analog as your ears only work in analog.

VIn June, Microsoft ran its own test that showed Edge browser consumed less power on a laptop than Chrome, which came in at last place. Google isn\u2019t going to take it laying down, firing back with its own tests to prove that Chrome isn\u2019t the battery draining browser that Microsoft makes it out to be. You can see the results here.  It\u2019s no secret that Microsoft is heavily pushing for internet users to adopt its Edge browser, but with little success. Most people prefer Chrome, which is the most popular web browser in the world and Firefox. A few months ago, Microsoft tried to make Edge stand out by boasting about its energy saving capabilities by running its own test and releasing a video on the results:  The video showed the device using Chrome to stream content running out of battery after just 4 hours and 20 minutes. Edge lasted 7 hours and 22 minutes. Google is calling bullshit and has released its own video showing the latest release of Chrome lasting 10 hours and 39 minutes while streaming videos:  The company said in a blog post: \u201cOf course, people use their browsers for more than just video. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been improving battery life across the board, tracking progress using power measurement tools. As one example, Chrome for Mac now uses 33 percent less power for everything from videos and images to simple page scrolling.\u201d The truth is, both Microsoft and Google\u2019s test results need to be taken with a grain of salt. Both companies\u2019 tests are skewed to favour their respective browsers. They\u2019re run on different devices with different video streaming services.

VWhen you go shopping for a new camera, how can you know which ones are good enough? Here\u2019s an easy guideline: they all are. If the camera was made within the last eight years or so, it does its job well enough. You can focus on the extras that fit your specific needs.\u000a Photo by Dylan Cantwell. That\u2019s the conclusion that product review site the Wirecutter came to. While many camera models have different approaches to taking pictures, picture quality is the one area that has more or less stabilised. Most modern cameras use high-quality, high-resolution sensors that are so small and so cheap, nearly every camera can use them: \u000aSeeking out a \u201cbetter\u201d camera to improve your photos is a fool\u2019s errand. To be clear, I\u2019m not saying that all cameras produce identical images, or that any single camera is an equally good option for every type of photographer. Buying a new camera can make a significant difference in your photography, but only after you\u2019ve given considerable thought to how you\u2019re going to use it.\u000a So, if nearly every camera can take a \u201cgood enough\u201d picture, how should you decide what camera to get? According to the Wirecutter, you should pay attention to your shooting style. If you take a lot of pictures in dark rooms where you can\u2019t use a flash, focus on low-light performance. If you shoot in a variety of situations and need a high degree of control over your shots, get a DSLR and a few lenses. Getting the DSLR won\u2019t magically make you a better photographer, though. You can also buy simply based on what works for you. If you\u2019re faced with the choice between a Nikon or Canon camera with equal prices and similar specs, but one feels nicer to you, go ahead and get that one. Most cameras are more than good enough for nearly every need, so you can feel safe getting the one that\u2019s good for your needs. All Cameras Are Good Cameras [The Wirecutter] Darned good advice,  Just get one with an eye level viewfinder so you can see what you are shooting  outdoors and the light is behind you,  Then the screen becomes an obsolete feature.

VThe Mobilock is billed as the world\u2019s first smart padlock with IoT connectivity Seems like smart security is one of the fastest growing tech sectors at the moment. Rather than using a key or an easily hackable combination lock to protect your valuables, several manufacturers are introducing smart padlocks which use either biometrics (typically fingerprint recognition) or smartphone apps for identification \u2013 or sometimes both. Last month we wrote about the Tapp fingerprint lock which raised a total of $237,313 on crowdfunding website Indiegogo \u2013 smashing the original target by over 500%. Then last week we followed up with a round up of several home security products, including a Bluetooth smartlock from MasterLock which is similar to the Tapp except it doesn\u2019t have fingerprint recognition. This is available in two versions for £69 and £89 for indoor and outdoor use. Now we bring you news of two more smart padlocks set to hit the market. Pictured above is the Mobilock. Billed at the world\u2019s first bike connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), it\u2019s designed to be used as part of a bike sharing system, typically in a big city like Barcelona, Paris, Copenhagen, Hangzhou or New York For example the smartphone app can not only be used to open and close the lock but also monitor and localise all of the bikes in a network in real time, wherever and whenever they are, without having to use GPS technology. Instead Low Power Wide Area Networks \u2013 forming what\u2019s become known as the LORA Alliance \u2013 make it possible to connect billions of devices over large distances with the internet, using 3G or 4G. Because LORA chips and sensors need little power, the system hardly uses energy. A device connected to the LORA network is able to send data and commands for fifteen years using only two penlite batteries. Apparently the company has already received requests from bike rental companies, holiday parks, hotels and other companies in the tourism industry. \u201cWe are the first in the bike industry to apply this new technology,\u201d says Managing Director Walter Nieuwendijk, who developed the innovative technology together with co-founder Willem-Jan te Riele. \u201cThanks to LORA, rental companies can locate their bikes at any time and see who\u2019s riding them. Also, the system barely needs energy, while old GPS systems \u2013 for instance used in cars \u2013 need a lot of power. \u201cWith this addition Mobilock becomes the most complete and compact bike share system in the world.\u201d Another slightly more basic smart padlock is also due to launch very soon. Available from Australian accessories company Dog & Bone, it\u2019s called LockSmart and will be demonstrated at the Gadget Show Live in Birmingham later this month. The product, which is shown below, will be reviewed in the next couple of weeks on Tech Digest.    Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

V\u000aThe BBC has unveiled the micro:bit, a pocket-sized codeable computer (pictured above) with built-in motion detection, compass and Bluetooth technology, which is to be given free to every child in year 7 or equivalent across the UK from October. That\u2019s approximately 1 million units. A collaboration between 29 partners, including Lancaster University,  Barclays, Samsung and The Wellcome Trust, the micro:bit is the BBC\u2019s most ambitious education initiative since the 1980s when the BBC Micro introduced many children, including myself, to computing for the first time. The technical specifications for the device will be open sourced, and the partnership plans to develop a not-for-profit company to oversee and drive the micro:bit legacy. Says Sinead Rocks, Head of BBC Learning said.\u201cWe happily give children paint brushes when they\u2019re young, with no experience \u2013 it should be exactly the same with technology,\u201d The BBC micro:bit will start to arrive in schools in late October, giving children a chance to settle into new schools, and teachers the opportunity to build it in to lesson plans for the rest of the academic year. Importantly, the BBC and partners will be working closely with teachers, educators and schools to ensure that resources, information and support are available in advance of distribution this autumn. BBC Learning will also provide resources that support the curriculum including Live Lessons, getting started videos, projects and tutorials. The BBC micro:bit initiative aims to make a huge impact in 2015 with the BBC and its partners committed to providing up to one million micro:bits before the end of the year. Says Tony Hall, BBC Director-General: \u201cWe all know there\u2019s a critical and growing digital skills gap in this country, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we come together and do something about it,\u201d Measuring just 4cm by 5cm, the micro:bit is available in a range of colours, and designed to be fun and easy to use. It can be coded with something simple in seconds \u2013 like lighting up its LEDs or displaying a pattern \u2013 with no prior knowledge of computing. It also connects to other devices, sensors, kits and objects, and is a companion to Arduino, Galileo, Kano, littleBits and Raspberry Pi, acting as a spring board to more complex learning. Each element is completely programmable via easy-to-use software on a dedicated website (available later in the summer at www.microbit.co.uk) that can be accessed from a PC, tablet or mobile. A personal area on the website allows users to save and test creations in a simulator before they are transferred to the micro:bit. KEY FEATURES OF THE BBC MICRO:BIT \u2022 25 red LEDs to light up, flash messages, create games and invent digital stories. \u2022 Two programmable buttons activated when pressed. Use the micro:bit as a games controller. Pause or skip songs on a playlist. \u2022 On-board motion detector or \u201caccelerometer\u201d that can detect movement and tell other devices you\u2019re on the go. Featured actions include shake, tilt and freefall. Turn the micro:bit into a spirit level. Light it up when something is moved. Use it for motion-activated games. \u2022 A built-in compass or \u201cmagnetometer\u201d to sense which direction you\u2019re facing, your movement in degrees, and where you are. Includes an in-built magnet, and can sense certain types of metal. \u2022 Bluetooth Smart Technology to connect to the internet and interact with the world around you. Connect the micro:bit to other micro:bits, devices, kits, phones, tablets, cameras and everyday objects all around. Share creations or join forces to create multi-micro:bit masterpieces. Take a selfie. Pause a DVD or control your playlist. \u2022 Five Input and Output (I/O) rings to connect the micro:bit to devices or sensors using crocodile clips or 4mm banana plugs. Use the micro:bit to send commands to and from the rings, to power devices like robots and motors.     Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VWhen Star Trek fans fight about the best Trek show, nine times out of 10 they\u2019re arguing about the original series versus The Next Generation. Obviously, both shows are excellent and fundamental to the franchise, but they aren\u2019t the best Trek ever put on television. I believe that honour belongs to Deep Space Nine and praise the prophets, do I love it.  We\u2019ve previously talked about Star Trek\u2018s inherent optimism and hope. But in those previous series, that often meant characters would land on a planet, deal with a problem and move on to the next location. But even in a future as bright as the one promised by Star Trek: Deep Space Nine knew that not everything would be \u2014 or even could be \u2014 perfect. Deep Space Nine took the world \u2014 er, universe \u2014 established in the previous shows and opened it up to all the longstanding complexities that would come with it. We got to see how these different species groups lived and worked together over a long period of time. We saw amazing friendships and bitter rivalries developing side-by-side. (It\u2019s why having the show take place on a space station made so much sense.)  And while the Federation was still as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as ever, dedicated to making the universe a more peaceful, prosperous place, we also got to see that not everyone has the same idea of what\u2019s best, especially when it came down to different species. Sometimes it went hand-in-hand with humanity\u2019s mission, other times it was completely the opposite. But we had a great crew that knew the value of compromise. \u201cDo you like my head stick?\u201d For example, in Star Trek: First Contact, Picard tells Lily that there\u2019s no money in the future because people work to better themselves. However, that\u2019s only true for humanity. For many aliens, there\u2019s gold-pressed latinum. It may not be used by humans, but it\u2019s almost sacred to other species. For the Ferengi, money is how they better themselves. In the first episode, we see Commander Sisko utilise Quark\u2019s Ferengian principles in order to keep him working on the space station. He even got the blessing of the Grand Nagus when he needed Quark\u2019s help to find the Founders. And he did that through respect for the customs that his own society didn\u2019t uphold. Sisko\u2019s strength was in his ability to juggle the needs of all those on his station, of finding the best solution for the greatest amount of people, while knowing that not everyone would be or could be satisfied. Star Trek\u2018s utopia may be great for humans, but it\u2019s not always great for everyone else. Deep Space Nine recognised that. Differences in ideology lead to problems. In the case of the Dominion, it led to war. That\u2019s because perfection is impossible. Deep Space Nine was strong because it shows the cracks in a utopian dream \u2014 idealism only goes so far, and everybody\u2019s version of a perfect world will inevitably conflict. But this doesn\u2019t mean Deep Space Nine is the \u201cdarker Star Trek\u201d (I really hate when people call it that). The show has a lot of heart and a great deal of humour. We saw an entire episode where our heroes got stuck in the most stupid game in the universe. They put a bomb in a Tribble. A bomb in a Tribble. And let\u2019s not forget that Commander Sisko used the power of his words, not his weapons, to convey humanity, love, even the concept of linear time to a group of aliens called the Prophets. Deep Space Nine was, in its way, just as hopeful as the original series or The Next Generation \u2014 it just didn\u2019t hide how much work it would be to achieve that future, and how difficult it would be. Likewise, Sisko was the first Star Trek captain who wasn\u2019t afraid to show his flaws, often to his own detriment. He was a man who was kind and clever, but made irrational decisions when he was angry or scared. He was even complicit in the murder of a senator to convince the Romulans to fight against the Dominion. Like many captains, he was forced to make questionable decisions that blurred the lines between right and wrong; Sisko simply had to make them a lot more often. Cheers to being an accessory! We also got our first (and I\u2019d argue only good) portrayal of religion in the franchise. The Cardassian/Bajoran conflict was something that was first introduced in The Next Generation, but Deep Space Nine was what gave it flight. Religion was never much of topic on Star Trek before Deep Space Nine, largely because Roddenberry was an atheist, but I think the Bajorans were an excellent introduction. The storyline taught religious tolerance and understanding. Sisko was a holy figure to these people, and even though he didn\u2019t agree with their beliefs (at least at first), he still honoured them to the best of his ability. At the end of Season 1, when Sisko\u2019s son Jake asks him why Bajorans believe that the wormhole is something sacred when it\u2019s clearly not, Sisko teaches him about the value of compassion and respect to differing faiths. It\u2019s a powerful lesson that still echoes today. It also showed what happens when religion and politics collide. Throughout their decades of slavery, the only thing that kept the Bajorans going was their faith. Once they were free, their faith fell to infighting, because they were no longer unified against a common enemy.  Sects succumbed to religious extremism to the point where members were committing acts of terrorism, like when Neela blew up the station school in \u201cIn the Hands of the Prophets\u201d because it wasn\u2019t teaching what amounted to Bajoran Creationism. But Sisko didn\u2019t let fear and intimidation take over, he continued to embrace his Bajoran allies. Utopia doesn\u2019t always work, but love does. The biggest message at the end of the day for Deep Space Nine is there are no easy endings. Our heroes don\u2019t conclude their journey playing a friendly game of poker, they\u2019re forced to sacrifice almost everything they have in order to try and make the universe a better place. Because that\u2019s what you have to do in the real world. But if that doesn\u2019t convince you, all I can say is: Morn. Case closed. Warms my heart to read this entire article, I'm a major, MAJOR Deep Space Nine fan. I absolutely adore this show and once a year, since it ended (I owned all the VHS tapes at one stage, then the DVD's, now it's on netflix thank god!) I power through all 7 seasons. It's hard for me to believe it's 17 years this year since DS9 ended on June 2 1999, I remember sitting there, 21 years of age, initially shocked they left it so open ended, hoping we would get a continuation down the road somewhere. I know now that will never happen, I know someone wrote a book but it's just not the same as seeing the actors return to the roles.  To me DS9 always embodied the very best of Star Treks morals and ethics in a way not even TNG touched upon, it openly embraced religion, atheism, agnosticism and treated them all with respect. It embraced gender diversity, sexual diversity, racial and cultural diversity and respected all boundaries of those too. TNG touched lightly upon some of these aspects but never as heavily as DS9 did, diving into them head long, even basing characters such as Jadzia Dax and Odo around ideas of gender diversity and fluidity well ahead of their time.  I miss this style of old Trek, the week to week episodes and what they'd bring and I particularly miss DS9's lessons from it's episodes that just because something is good for you, doesn't mean it's good for someone else and you should seek compromise or that sometimes it's ok to mess shit up, because you're only "hyoo-munn". I'm not very fond of new Trek to be honest and I really do hope Star Trek Discovery brings us back to this old style. But I sincerely hope that one day, just somehow one day, the characters from DS9 make some sort of return to the small or silver screen. I'd love to see Cirroc Loften reprise Jake Cisco and find his father, or Armin Shimmerman cameo as Quark in something one last time. Hell, I would KILL to see Colm Meaney as Chief O'brien show up in Trek somehow because that son of a bitch just *does not age*. Siddig El Fadil (I never warmed to his stage name of Alexander Siddig, he will always be Siddig El Fadil to me), and Colm sharing the screen as Bashir and O'brien again would just make me jump for joy.  It'll never happen I know, but I wish it would :( Thanks for the article though, it was a brilliant read :) \u000a									Last edited September 11, 2016 11:06 am								 Looking for something new on Netflix and you just inspired me! I've never watched anything Star Trek other than random little bits on TV now and again over the years, so should be interesting.

VAfter you take the time to give your shower a good cleaning, you\u2019ll want to do whatever you can to keep it that way. This DIY after-shower spray made with tea tree oil will keep everything looking clean and mildew free. \u000aPhoto by Carissa Rogers. Tea tree oil is an essential oil made from the leaves of the tea tree (not to be confused with the common tea plant). It can kill bacteria and fungus, and is often used to treat skin infections, fungal infections, lice, scabies, and athlete\u2019s foot. That\u2019s why Brittney Morgan at Apartment Therapy suggests it makes a great ingredient for a homemade after-shower spray. Grab an empty spray bottle and mix 20 drops of tea tree oil with two cups of distilled white vinegar, and two teaspoons of non-castille based liquid dish soap. After showering every day, give your shower a spritz and you won\u2019t have to worry about any buildup or funky smells. You can even keep the spray in the shower so you never forget.

V If you\u2019ve ever planned a wedding, you\u2019ve probably heard that using the word \u201cwedding\u201d can be costly. In this video, a wedding videographer explains why vendors charge more for the same services on your big day. They also offer some insight on how to get around it.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s called wedding markup. In the video, for example, subjects get two quotes from the same venue, one for a \u201cfamily gathering\u201d and the other specifically for a wedding. The cost is $15,000 versus $17,000. Wedding markup is nothing new, but the video points to a few reasons why it exists. For one, people are unfamiliar with the market, so they\u2019re more willing to pay higher prices. There\u2019s also \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d mentality: It\u2019s a big day, so it\u2019s worth the splurge. On the flip side, wedding customers are also usually more demanding and expect more out of vendors, so this is reflected in the cost, too. Here\u2019s what they have to say about it: \u000aThe upshot of this is that the emotional weight of weddings usually means more work for vendors. And thus, higher prices. And the most demanding clients are the ones that set the prices for everyone. So the best thing you can do to avoid being swindled is to demand a price range before hearing a sales pitch. We vendors might hate it but it\u2019s the fair thing to do.\u000a This way, before assuming your demands, vendors give you an idea of what you can expect. In short, they suggest asking for a little transparency. For more on this topic, check out the full video. Why are weddings so damn expensive? [Vox (YouTube)]

p486
VWe\u2019ve all struggled with dodgy Wi-Fi at home. It\u2019s really hard to find a decent router \u2014 even an expensive and powerful one \u2014 that can cover every room, nook and cranny of your house with fast and more importantly reliable wireless. That\u2019s usually because your router sits in one place, likely near the front of your house where your internet connection is. Netgear\u2019s new Orbi router, though, has dedicated Wi-Fi satellites that evenly distribute fast wireless over a dedicated network. Using one band of 802.11ac\u2018s three-band Wave 2 Wi-Fi for a mesh network running only between base station and satellites, the Orbi comes with one of Netgear\u2019s wireless routers in the box and one satellite, pre-paired to make setup easier. Netgear says the simplest approach is to install the router at your internet connection point and the single satellite at the centre of your house or apartment, where it\u2019ll radiate a wireless signal equally.  If your house is larger, though, or has a couple of levels, you can add multiple Orbi satellites \u2014 all of which communicate over that mesh network \u2014 to spread signal further. And because it\u2019s operating over a dedicated third band, it doesn\u2019t slow down the speed of the router\u2019s main 5GHz and 2.4GHz channels. Netgear promises no dead spots, as long as you have enough satellites installed, and moving between satellites is seamless.  It\u2019s a great concept in theory, and like Sonos\u2019 mesh network, it should be easily expendable to cover a huge range and multiple levels, with each satellite contributing range to the other. Netgear promises 3Gbps speeds from the Orbi\u2019s AC3000 network, which should be more than enough for everything but the most demanding and device-heavy households.  Of course, you can already supplement your existing Wi-Fi router with a range extender, and you can even get some that operate over a single network name. Orbi, then, isn\u2019t a solution for existing networks as much as it is a good first-time solution for new house buyers or owner builders. And, of course, there\u2019s the fact that range extenders limit the speed of your existing WiFi setup.  At the moment, only the single-satellite Orbi set will be available in Australia, some time before the end of the year, for $749. Larger kits and standalone satellites will be available in 2017. When that happens, it should be an easy solution to building a resilient wireless network in even the largest house. [Netgear]  Please fix your link to Netgear. It's netgear.com/orbi Is this a different approach to other examples of Mesh networking like Open Mesh? Sounds great but for that price I'm sticking with those evil cables and power over ethernet which works nicely all over our house. Neat concept but I can see the spectrum ending up even more polluted as time goes by. I solved my connectivity problems using a cheap switch at the patch panel so that the router wasn't useless when I moved it to a more central location. I like it. Sure they look like rolls of toilet paper but they're still nice.

VCould Foxtel actually be listening to its customers? News coming from the CEO Peter Tonagh today seems to be leaning in that direction, seriously.  Foxtel\u2019s subscription TV service, Foxtel Play, is getting a pricing makeover \u201cdesigned to make it competitive\u201d with rivals Netflix and Stan. Foxtel also signed a new long-term agreement with HBO starting January 2017, increasing the broadcasting of HBO content by five times, and allowing you to access the entire HBO library on-demand, forever. Hmmm. A \u201cbring your own device\u201d and \u201cbring your own bandwidth\u201d approach to Foxtel Play will be launched in December, with five different entry level tiers between $9 and $15 a month (according to AdNews). There will be two options for drama plus one option for Lifestyle, one for Documentary and one for Kids. There\u2019s also a Sports tier and a Movies tier. You will have access to all channels in the tier you choose, along with all of the on-demand, catch up and library content available to that tier \u2014 plus mobile access via Foxtel Go. With the new pricing, Foxtel says it is now providing everything from a low cost, low commitment entry point, through to the premium, high end of the subscription TV spectrum via full service cable/satellite set top boxes. In terms of new content, on top of the HBO deal Foxtel are also creating six new Australasian productions as part of including a a $125 million investment in local content \u2014 the first to be announced is a remake of Picnic at hanging rock.  There\u2019s the Binge channel launching 1 October, and also a Stars Wars channel in the works \u2014 we can expect that one before Rogue One. But where does all this leave Presto, Foxtel\u2019s on SVOD baby with Seven West Media? Nothing has been confirmed as yet, but we do know the service hasn\u2019t exactly made headway against its major rivals. Time will tell.  Considering Seven West are pulling out of Presto with that content likely to go over to Netflix, I'll be stunned if they don't just fold the Presto content into the Foxtel Go service. Where did you read that netflix may pick up 7 content? that would be a first, especially since netflix doesn't have a lot of reality at present. Everything foxtel owned on presto was already showing on foxtel anyway, including Mr Robot You know, that's a super good question because after googling it I cannot at all verify this. I recall reading this article at the time and (going on the fact Seven West invested in one program which was picked up by Netflix) must've misremembered an incorrect conclusion. My bad! That said, given that Seven West seems interested in a streaming platform and missed the boat on Stan, I do wonder if they'll give Netflix a go. In any case, whether they partner with Netflix or Stan, I've got both. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 3:31 pm								 While I also have both, I would MUCH prefer that they went with Netflix. It is by far the superior platform. Stan is better than Presto, but good god are they both a long way behind Netflix (note that this is an opinion about platform/technology/user friendliness rather than content). The closure of Presto (into this new foxtel offering) has been floated since the beginning of the year, even before that. It's been on the cards for a while now. If it doesn't offer HD, this service will fail as well. I'm surprised to see mention of a $9-15 price on here, no other publication has mentioned a price. I'd be interested in this, with the only condition it provides good quality 1080p streaming. It's 2016 - Japan will stream 8k in 2020, surely Foxtel can manage HD They don't even do 1080P on foxtel satellite and cable boxes. It will be 720p at best and perhaps then restricted to 3mbps or less. Foxtel over satellite is still a premium service.  In a SMH article today, the foxtel CEO is quoted as saying Australia doesn't have the bandwidth to support a the premium quality of foxtel IQ. That suggests to me it will be SD only, with HD reserved for sat/cable foxtel. Here's what he actually said, hopefully I'm allowed to quote this here:\u000achief executive Peter Tonagh noted "Australian broadband infrastructure is not suited to delivering traditional premium quality of Foxtel IQ"\u000aand\u000a"We at the moment see indications that even NBN customers are not happy with the speed of the service," he told BusinessDay.\u000aand\u000a"It's more around [being] unicast or multicast, and a broadcast product is designed to deliver one to many... the [broadband] technology is just not designed for the mass market common streaming. " \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 3:01 pm								 Oh my...He has used Netflix hasn't he? Thanks for the information - guess I won't be signing up anytime soon.

Unless I'm missing something, it sounds like it's still not a case of pay the monthly fee, get the content. It's pay a monthly fee, get some content, or pay another monthly fee and get some other content, or pay a big monthly fee and get everything - in other words, same annoying set up from their cable service. Yes that's how every incumbent pay tv company in the world works, even Sky Now in the UK which this is based on. Not saying it's right, it's just reality. But surely that means it isn't competing with Netflix et al on anything other than price for one, likely shitty, package? Also, this focus on tying exclusive material to services is pushing people to just wait. So blu-ray or dvd become delayed competition while people binge now on whatever is on Netflix. Anyone under the age of 70 who reads this site is probably pirating it, not waiting for a dvd or blu ray. In case anyone is wondering, the image above is of a typical soulless Foxtel employee. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 3:16 pm								 That's cold man.. dead cold so price for hbo, then star wars, then drama so by the end you are looking at $100+ for the content? instead of a single affordable monthly fee like netflix......... If netflix charged $20 a month and included HBO content that would kinda kill this. They'll still need a lot of work to match it with Netflix and Stan. Currently streaming SD content from Foxtel Go on a decent internet connection can still get stuck buffering a lot while Netflix's UHD content is streaming without issue. Also not forgetting that you can get the top-tier Telstra internet bundle for only $30 more which includes Foxtel HD. Hate all you want, but that's actually very good for something that used to cost ~$100/mo. The full text of the foxtel speech is here:\u000ahttp://decidertv.com/page/2016/9/6/full-speach-new-ceo-peter-tonagh-announces-revolution-for-foxtel Nice try Foxtel, you're heading in the right direction though.... just a few more steps into 2016 and I might consider it (at this rate it'll be 2024). \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 3:59 pm								 Noooo  Foxtel doesn't listen to customers but it does listen to market forces and they are saying your business model is dead. These tweaks are not going to help in the long run. It still does not answer one of Foxtels biggest issues which is there multi-tear payment/package system. I don't want to have to pick and choose what packages I want to include and pay for a hole lot of shows I don't want just so I can get access to that one show i do actually want.. Dear Mr Foxtel\u000aThis is the future. My buddy in he pub tells me about this great show. I go home Google "Show Name" and it's there on a few web sites. I click on the link and open the page with three options, watch now with adverts, pay to watch without ads or become a member and get lots of shows. That's it. Dear Mr Foxtel\u000aThis is the future.

To little to late Foxtel, You are dying. Your stealing of exclusives hasnt driven customers to you, Its driven them to piracy (Game of thrones says hello). This is hilarious. Customers are asking for a single affordable cost for content and content above 480p resolution. That's it.  Multiple packages and crappy resolution guarantees the end of foxplay I think you mean the end of foxpay :) Foxtel also signed a new long-term agreement with HBO starting January 2017, increasing the broadcasting of HBO content by five times, and allowing you to access the entire HBO library on-demand, forever. Well that's terrible news. The sooner US distributors get out of exclusive contracts with companies like Foxtel, the sooner their content will appear on better services like Netflix. Another long-term contract with Foxtel probably means it won't be on streaming services in Australia for the indefinite future. Foxtel already has a streaming service, (and by the way, so does HBO, you just need a VPN to access it) but I know what you mean. If the articles are right about the pricing , then at $30 a month accessing the HBO content should be a bit cheaper. Foxtel's streaming service is garbage though. What was the last report on it, that it caps at 480p? I'd rather the programs weren't locked to exclusive contracts and were available through multiple vendors, so I can choose the one I want to buy from. I don't want to be forced to use Foxtel and pay for another streaming service when I already have Netflix and would rather download the show from the Play Store if Netflix wasn't an option. If it's still in SD, it's still going to be rubbish. If the option to simply torrent content in radically higher quality still exists, then it's ridiculously hard to justify going with the Foxtel option even if I WANT to be paying for the content (which I do). +1 the same thing applies to release windows. Why would I wait an extra month to watch Season 2 of 60 Days In, when in the US they will air the 5th episode tomorrow? Same thing about The Profit (another great show). Season 4 Episode 3 airs later today yet there is no sign of even an airdate for A&E Australia (which foxtel owns). Ridiculous. I have the day off work later this month when I will call disconnections. If they can't match Telstra's $35 a month for ent+sport offer then I will cancel. Sport is the only thing Foxtel airs on time these days. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 9:19 am								 They just don't get it? Do they? If you want to catch up with Netflix you need to offer everything for a flat price and at decent quality. But even if they'd match that they would still be behind. Netflix produced content is now the biggest selling point. Not sure how they think they can match that? I will happily let my dog do a little wee on Foxtel's grave best comment ever,\u000aI'll see your dog and raise you with, i'll go out and buy a dog just so it can pee on the same grave after your dog has done its doggy doos too. The tiered aspect bothers me a bit - especially if they're going to start offering a subscription/streaming sports channel. I hated paying for Foxtel simply to access live AFL games. Used a VPN to access AFL live, but found I watched less matches that way. If they could stream the games locally, then I'll subscribe for sure... but... I'm not keen on subscribing with a base package that I won't use. Don't they get that users don't want that experience anymore? How is this deal good? Maybe better than their old lousy deals but if you still have to buy multiple channels and they're between $9 and 15 that's still too much. Two drama channels - so you subscribe to one then discover what you want is on the other, or some is on both? *ugh* Maybe if the subs were *really* cheap per channel it'd be ok. Or better yet, they could just offer pay per view. I'd love to be able to see some of the NRL games that aren't publicly broadcast, but I don't want to watch *all* of them. Those options sound confusing.  If I can somehow watch Game of Thrones as it releases for $9 a month then I might be tempted to sign up for just that period, but thanks to previous years of a high priced paywall  I've gotten used to just avoiding spoilers for 10 weeks then binge watching the entire season (in HD) after buying it on iTunes. This might be a case of too little too late I'm afraid. Why would I want to pay to stream 480p when I can just find streaming sites and watch them for free (blocking scripts and ads of course)?

VOn September 8, 1966, exactly 50 years ago today, the very first episode of Star Trek aired on television. More than just science fiction, it dared to imagine a future for humanity where it had moved past war, inequality, and poverty, replacing them with tolerance, exploration, and hope. And it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that Star Trek changed the world.  Star Trek has had many incarnations over the years \u2014 there have been six television shows, 726 total episodes, 13 movies, and one reboot \u2014 but its primary mission has stayed the same. The result is a series that one countless awards (31 Emmys!) but has also fostered a massive fandom that includes actors, politicians, and more. It\u2019s a show that created and made famous many of the tropes that science fiction uses all the time now. It\u2019s a series so influential that an actual spacecraft was named after the fictional starship Enterprise. Scientists have spent years working to turn the fake technology seen in the series into a reality. President Barack Obama is a fan. On-screen, it helped popularise diversity in popular entertainment. It made all its viewers feel included and inspired. A beautiful example is Leslie Jones telling the story of seeing Whoopi Goldberg on television for the first time and being so thrilled to see someone who looked like her. And that connects back to Goldberg, when she saw Uhura on Star Trek at age nine. \u201cI looked at it and I went screaming through the house,\u201d she said, \u201c\u2018Come here, mum, everybody, come quick, come quick, there\u2019s a black lady on television and she ain\u2019t no maid!\u2019 I knew right then and there I could be anything I wanted to be.\u201d It\u2019s a show so ground-breaking that it gets credit for things it wasn\u2019t even the first to do. Kirk and Uhura\u2019s kiss wasn\u2019t the first scripted interracial kiss on television, but everyone thinks it is. But that myth is still part of the influence of Star Trek, and it\u2019s a myth easy to believe because of how hard Star Trek likes to push the boundaries, to (boldly) go whether other series and movies so seldom do, to reveal what humanity would look like at its most accepting, its most optimistic, and its most noble. It seems impossible now, but back in 1966, the original Star Trek was not an easy sell \u2014 it had two pilots and a major cast change before going on the air \u2014 and it was canceled after three seasons, due to low ratings. But thanks to syndication, a loyal fandom arose, one that has only grown over the last five decades. Now it\u2019s an institution. And it\u2019s an institution that will continue, as the series finally returns to TV next year with Bryan Fuller\u2019s highly anticipated Star Trek: Discovery. Here\u2019s to you, Star Trek. And here\u2019s to the next 50 years.

p496
VThe big news last night that Twitter is changing the way that it works, so that users can DM each other, even if they\u2019re not following each other.  Don\u2019t worry \u2013 it looks like you\u2019ll be able to opt out of the functionality, but it does seem like a strange decision for a company that has come under increased scrutiny with demands that it do something about all of the abuse and public shaming it enables. Campaigners have long suggested features like limiting visible mentions to people you already follow \u2013 so it seems bizarre for Twitter to go completely the other way. So what\u2019s going on? Essentially, it is about two of the problems facing Twitter: money and scale. Let\u2019s start with money. Twitter is still struggling to figure out how to turn tweets into cash, to the same extent that rival Facebook has. Sure, there\u2019s sponsored tweets, but the options for monetisation are rather slim. By opening up DMs, Twitter makes itself a better proposition for companies and brands. As everyone knows, most big companies already have a Twitter presence for fielding customer support queries and the like, but it isn\u2019t completely seamless. As communications are public by default, asking customers to hand over account numbers and bank details is an obvious no-no. As such, many exchanges end up with the brand asking the customer to follow them, so they can DM and discuss it. By removing this step by enabling DMs for all, Twitter suddenly makes it a more frictionless experience \u2013 and gives brands another channel through which to communicate with us more easily, and more personally too. Presumably Twitter will further monetise these interactions by offering companies a richer suite of tools to analyse and engage with customers like this. Don\u2019t be surprised if we start seeing DMs used in a similar way to Facebook\u2019s forthcoming Messenger platform, where instead of using emails, companies use DMs to send us notifications. Then there\u2019s the problem of scale. Twitter has been growing slower than competing platforms, and as other social networks have discovered, with the users that you do have, there\u2019s a limit to the amount of social networking they want to do. So the challenge for Twitter is how can it get users to spend more time with their eyeballs on their Twitter app? In recent years though we\u2019ve seen a surge in the number of messaging apps. Not just iMessage, WhatsApp, Snapchat and the like \u2013 but other apps have pivoted to better support private messaging between people. Both Instagram and Vine, on top of their core functions, now have pretty advanced messaging apps built in. Facebook has even launched an entirely separate messenger app. By opening up DMs Twitter has, in effect, turned the DM feature into a fully-fledged messaging app. Not so long ago it launched the ability to send photos and embed tweets into DMs, and now it has taken the final step and removed the last barrier to messaging anyone on the service. This could mean more eyeballs on Twitter, and more new users attracted by the network effect of their friends all being on Twitter. Don\u2019t be surprised if at some point Twitter lifts the 140-character limit on DMs. Whether the move will go down well with Twitter\u2019s existing userbase remains to be seen \u2013 but as a commercial entity, it is only doing what the business people want. Its another good reminder that if you\u2019re not paying to use something, you are the product being sold. James is the Editor of TechDigest. You can follow him on Twitter @Psythor.

VSharks don\u2019t really like the taste of people, but their poor vision and the splashing of beachgoers can lead to sharks confusing you for a tasty snack. Here\u2019s what you should do if you see a fin and the Jaws theme starts playing.\u000a\u000aIllustration by Sam Woolley. Photo by Elias Levy. If you don\u2019t want to see fins circling while you surf, it\u2019s best to stick to safer waters. According to shark expert Richard Peirce, the former chairman of Shark Trust, it\u2019s best to avoid swimming near river mouths and fishing boats. Peirce says fishing operations of any size are prime shark attractors. Hooked fish bleed into the water, and that attracts sharks. Even a small fishing boat will toss dead fish and fish parts, or chum, into the water. It\u2019s also a bad idea to let yourself bleed or urinate in the water for the very same reason. And if you can, avoid swimming in the ocean early in the morning or late at night. Peirce says most shark attacks happen at those times because they have reduced visibility and will mistake people for prey.  There are 15 shark attacks per year in Australia on average, with three recorded fatalities per year. So while shark attacks aren\u2019t an everyday occurrence, they\u2019re on the rise, and they happen often enough that people who spend a lot time in the ocean are always on the lookout for ways to keep them away. \u201cShark repellent\u201d is a liquid extract you spray on yourself that\u2019s made from putrefied shark remains. The idea is that nearby sharks smell their dead friends and decide they don\u2019t want to eat you. It works pretty well \u2014 even the Mythbusters say so \u2014 but these sprays are expensive and make you stink like, well, dead shark, so it\u2019s not ideal for a fun day at the beach. Other methods, like the Shark Shield, use electromagnetic fields to keep sharks away. When sharks encounter these fields, the electrical receptors make them feel intense discomfort so they leave the area unharmed. Again, these have proven to be somewhat effective, but they cost around $800, and are really only used by deep sea divers or commercial fisherman. Truth be told, humans do far more harm to sharks than they do to us since we hunt them in order to make soup, lubricants and leather. But if you do have a run-in with one of the most effective killing machines on Earth, stay chill. According to Peirce, splashing around wildly is just going to excite the shark and make it more interested. It doesn\u2019t want to eat you, but it might get curious. For all the shark knows, you could be a seal or large fish. Unfortunately for you, the only way sharks can interact with things is with their razor-filled mouths, so splashing like crazy might earn you an \u201cexploratory bite\u201d. Once you regain your composure, here\u2019s what else Peirce says you can do: If the shark attacks, George H. Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research, suggests you try and put something in between you and the shark if you can. A surfboard, boogie board or flotation device will do. As it makes a pass at you, try to strike the shark anywhere you can. This will startle the shark and may buy you enough time to get out of the water. If the shark bites you and won\u2019t let go, poke the shark hard in the eyes or gills since those are very sensitive. As soon as it lets you go, get to shore as fast as possible and seek medical attention. This is part of Lifehacker\u2019s Animal Attacks Series. As capable as we humans think we are, bears, snakes, wolves, sharks and even bees can turn a fun day outside into a harsh, potentially life-threatening reality check. Here\u2019s what to do when you find yourself face to face with some of the deadliest beasts in the great outdoors. Sharks are scary, and shark attacks grab headlines, but to put things in perspective... World wide, people kill between 100 million and 200 million sharks each year...\u000ahttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X13000055 while sharks kill about 10 people each year...\u000ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack#Statistics Meanwhile, bees, dogs, cows and even champagne corks kill more people each year than sharks....\u000ahttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/16/chart-the-animals-that-are-most-likely-to-kill-you-this-summer/ Sharks don\u2019t really like the taste of people I've always been curious about that statement and have heard the same thing for years but no idea why. Google has returned mixed results I remember years ago Mythbusters did an episode on this stuff which had some really cool results.\u000aIf only we could all be as Baws as Kelly Slater and take on a shark in a fist fight and win! I saw on the news a few weeks back Bondi beach were looking at using Drones to patrol the beach and had 'shark bombs' that they can drop near the shark to help repel them, really cool stuff Kelly Slater? I think you mean Mick Fanning.

V\u000a Name: Asus ZenPad 8.0 Z380C Type: Web Tablet\u000a\u000a Specs: Click here for full specs Price: From £99\u000aASUS (officially pronounced ASOOS) may not be a brand you\u2019ve heard too much about. But over the last few years it has become reasonably well established in the web tablet market, thanks largely to its collaboration with Google on the 2012 Nexus 7 tablet. Since then it has gone on to manufacture a number of tablet-type products including a 2-in-1 hybrid laptop/tablet called the ASUS Transformer Book which we reviewed here. In this review Chris Price tests out one of the company\u2019s entry level, standalone web tablet, the ZenPad 8.0  Design Whereas earlier ASUS tablets felt a little plasticky, the ZenPad seems a sturdy piece of work with a classy rounded metal frame. Indeed it\u2019s actually a little more heavy than I was expecting, tipping the scales at 350 grammes. Size-wise the ZenPad is a little longer than the iPad Mini (which has a screen size of 7.9 inches), measuring 209mm compared to 200mm. It\u2019s also a little thicker at 8.5mm compared to 7.2mm for the iPad Mini. However, it\u2019s not quite so wide as the Mini, measuring 123mm across compared to 135mm. The ASUS Zen Pad comes with different coloured clip on backs including black, white and metallic For those who like to personalise their web tablet, ASUS provides three different covers for the back which can be clipped on quite easily (see pic above). However, the colours aren\u2019t particularly exciting \u2013 no reds. blues or yellows which would have been nice. In addition, there\u2019s also a separate power charger which can clip on the back of the ZenPad instead. Costing around £35 from Amazon, the power case extends battery life by up to 16 hours, Asus claims, and is charged by placing the power adaptor into a small magnetic power block on top of the case. This is then removed when the case is attached to the ZenPad. The only problem I found was that the Powercase does add quite a bit to the weight of the device as well as adding to its bulkiness. However, for regular users who are always running out of juice that\u2019s probably a small price to pay for having the extra power onboard. Another additional extra for the ZenPad (though not one we tested) is an audio cover which turns the mono sound of the tablet into 5.1 channel surround sound for a richer cinematic experience \u2013 although you will have to get mighty close to the screen to enjoy the equivalent visual experience. As well as a cinema mode, the audio case (pictured below) also offers music, gaming and speech modes for different types of audio input. It\u2019s a great idea although I\u2019m not convinced that many people will choose to pay the extra to pair the tablet with a surround sound speaker system, given that the device is only £99 and the extra speakers will set you back £69 (in any case having checked online the speakers don\u2019t seem to be on sale anywhere) The optional audio cover adds surround sound to the ZenPad. But it will set you back £69 when available Display Given the £99 price tag I wasn\u2019t really expecting a great display but actually the ZenPad is a pleasant surprise. Resolution is just 1280 x 800 pixels which is certainly nothing to write home about. Other similarly priced tablets like Tesco\u2019s Hudl2 offer full HD resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels \u2013 although Tesco has now run out of stock of this hugely popular web tablet and isn\u2019t planning to restock. Nevertheless, image quality from the ZenPad is actually fine. On screen icons are clear and clean and I certainly didn\u2019t experience any blocking when I watched YouTube videos or TV programmes on the BBC iPlayer. Brightness levels are also fairly good although as with all web tablets we wouldn\u2019t recommend using in direct sunlight. On board are several visual enhancement modes including Tru2Life and TruVivid which ASUS claim boosts dynamic range and improve screen clarity. More disappointing are the onboard cameras which are really not that great. The rear facing camera offers just 5 Megapixels and the front facing \u2018selfie\u2019 camera just 2 Megapixels. As a result the images that I took of a beautiful autumn day in the woods near where I live (see below) weren\u2019t exactly fantastic quality though I\u2019ve seen worse. Various picture modes are available including the wonderfully named \u2018Beautification\u2019 mode to improve selfies as well as various editing options for after the picture is taken including \u2018big eyes\u2019, \u2018blush\u2019, \u2018thin cheeks\u2019 and \u2018soften skin\u2019. However, these are all quite gimmicky. There are also various Instagram type filters to turn your images into an oil painting, a charcoal drawing or sketch etc. A walk in the woods with my ZenPad. Image quality is OK \u2013 not the best Sound quality While screen quality is certainly acceptable the same can\u2019t be said for audio. Sound quality is exceptionally poor. Listening to Adele\u2019s monster hit, Hello, on YouTube I found the audio extremely tinny. This is partly because there is just one small speaker on board compared to more advanced and expensive tablets such as the iPad Mini which offer stereo sound. I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to use this tablet for watching TV programmes or listening to music for a long period of time though it\u2019s fine for listening through a decent pair of headphones. Of course ASUS offers the audio cover if you want to boost audio with surround sound but costing £69.99, this seems a little excessive for a tablet with a price tag of just £99. Performance Powered by a quad-core Intel Atom X3 CPU, ARM Mali-450 GPU and 1GB of RAM the ZenPad\u2019s specs aren\u2019t great compared to other tablets. But again we  didn\u2019t experience too many problems and given the price it\u2019s certainly not too bad. An Android web tablet, the ZenPad runs an adapted version of the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system and there\u2019s a Micro SD card slot for expanding storage beyond the 16Gb provided on board. \u000aVerdict: It\u2019s certainly not going to rival more expensive and superior spec tablets like the iPad Mini, but given it\u2019s £99 price tag (recently reduced from £119) the ZenPad was never expected to.  For surfing the web, accessing emails etc. it\u2019s a great little device with a lovely bright screen. However, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if you spend too much time playing audio through the tinny speaker. It\u2019s available from PC World here. \u000a  Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VAndroid is a powerful mobile operating system that provides a lot more customisation options than its competitors (namely the iPhone). Although the ins and outs of a handset can vary between phone makers, these Android shortcuts should work no matter what model of phone you\u2019re using. Here are 12 gestures you can use on Android that you might not know about.\u000a You can access the handy Quick Settings pane in Android by dragging down from the top of the screen to show your notifications, and then dragging down again. But if you use a two-finger swipe from the top of the screen, then the panel appears immediately, giving you instant access to switches for wi-fi, Bluetooth, aeroplane mode and the like. Google has gradually improved the way Android handles notifications in recent versions, and now everything works pretty smoothly when it comes to alerts. You can swipe to dismiss notifications, and in Nougat, you can press and hold to set preferences for that app. You can do it in Marshmallow too, but the settings aren\u2019t shown inline. Selecting text in Android is a cinch. In most Google apps, press and hold (or sometimes double-tap) somewhere on the screen to select a word, then drag out the handles on either side to highlight additional words. Third-party apps will occasionally behave differently. In Twitter for Android the same action copies text straight to the clipboard. Do you have a lot of tabs open in the Chrome browser for Android? Want to switch between them quickly? You can tap on the tab number icon, but you can also swipe down from Chrome\u2019s address bar to see your open tabs instead. Alternatively, swipe left or right on the address bar to jump from tab to tab without having to visit the overview screen in between. If you\u2019re running into persistent problems with your Android handset then there\u2019s a built-in Safe Mode you can use to disable (and troubleshoot) third-party apps. Press and hold the power button to bring up the Power Off pop-up, then press and hold the pop-up to find the Safe Mode option. To get out of Safe Mode, just reboot your phone again. Google Keyboard has all kinds of neat tricks up its sleeve, and one that we often find useful is for moving the cursor. Rather than stabbing at the screen to try and position it, just tap and hold the spacebar and then move your finger left and right. It should work in most apps as long as you\u2019re in text editing mode (the cursor is already in another word). You can triple-tap to zoom in on websites, images, and anything else in Android, but you need to enable the gesture shortcut in the OS settings first. From Settings, choose Accessibility, then tap Magnification gesture and turn the toggle switch at the top to on. Underneath the setting itself you get a helpful explanation of how to use the feature. It\u2019s not all that much of a time saver, but we\u2019re going to take it anyway. In a lot of Google apps for Android (including Gmail and Chrome), you don\u2019t have to tap to open a menu and then tap again. Just tap and hold on the menu button (usually three vertical dots), then drag down to the option you want, then release your finger or thumb to make the choice. Here\u2019s another handy shortcut for the Google Keyboard. Tap and hold on the comma key, then slide up to the icon on the right to activate the keyboard\u2019s new one-handed mode. If you don\u2019t have both of your hands free then it makes text input much easier. Note that it only works if you\u2019re in portrait mode. If you head to the Overview screen (tap the square nav button), then long-press on the icon for an app, you get a shortcut link straight to said app\u2019s diagnostics screen (where you can close or uninstall it). You may have to enable developer options for this one to work, which you can do by tapping seven times on Build number in About phone in Settings. An older trick, but one that plenty of people still haven\u2019t come across, and it often proves useful on the move. If you\u2019re using your phone with one hand, you can double-tap and then hold and drag in the Google Maps app to zoom in and out (drag down to zoom in and up to zoom out). The same trick also works in Google Maps for iOS, by the way. This being Android, you can install a few third-party apps to configure some gestures of your own if you\u2019re not fully satisfied with the ones that come built into the OS. Draw an S on the screen to launch Settings, and so on. There are a few apps to choose from for the job, including All In One Gestures, Gesture Shortcuts and Finger Gesture Launcher. Smartwake - the Air control feature is worth the price of this app alone. That new Samsung fire gesture just amazing! I learnt something new! Thanks guys!

p504
VFor six decades, scientists have watched a steadily circulating wind pattern in the tropical stratosphere, repeating like clockwork every two years. Now, for the first time, it\u2019s changed direction.  Image: NASA The pattern is called the quasi-biennial oscillation and it\u2019s a wind circulation that occurs every 28 months, miles above Earth\u2019s surface in the stratosphere. West-moving winds from the top of the tropical stratosphere slowly move downwards and are replaced in that top position by the easterly winds that were below them. Then the whole switch occurs repeats itself again and again, for the last 60 years at least. But at the end of last year, right when the west-moving winds were supposed to be moving down to start the switching pattern, instead, they rose right back upwards. The new pattern held for a full six months before the east winds finally replaced them again at the top this July. Researchers from NASA Goddard revealed the change in a paper in Geophysical Research Letters. The switch hasn\u2019t yet had any visible impact on existing weather patterns \u2014 besides the shift in wind circulation \u2014 but the sudden change still has scientists surprised and searching for an explanation. \u201cThe quasi-biennial oscillation is the stratosphere\u2019s Old Faithful,\u201d Paul Newman, lead scientist on the paper from NASA Goddard said in a statement. \u201cIf Old Faithful stopped for a day, you\u2019d begin to wonder about what was happening under the ground.\u201d Newman suggested two potential theories that could explain the switch. One is that it was yet another strange side-effect from the gigantic El Niño we just saw. But he also suspects that it could be an effect of our new, hot climate. The researchers are now trying to figure out just what the impact of the switch might be \u2014 and whether, as the world continues to warm, we\u2019re going to see it happen again. So, to clarify:\u000aWe've seen a piece of the stratosphere behaving like a nice sinusoid for 60 years, and we just saw that a half-cycle was upside down?\u000aAnd now, we need to know whether that's a problem, or a correction? Hmm I think I've watched a movie that had something vaguely resembling this... :P Oh dear.... Bet that's upset the little world of the climate change modellers...\u000aWho would have guessed that Mother Nature would do something unexpected after a huge 60 years.. I mean, that's enough to model the worlds climate history past and future yes? The modelers will be stoked, this is an opportunity to improve the models.\u000aYou don't understand science at all. Unlikely.. I've met quite a few. I understand science perfectly well, being that I have an MSc in physics.. But as a systems engineer I also understand the stupidity on taking an over-emphasis on what computers tell you, especially since they only tell you what you told them to tell you in the first place. We clearly know very different kinds of scientist.  If any scientist I know claimed not to be excited by this kind of new data in their field I'd think they were joshing me :P Wow. Climate change is possible the culprit after a 60-year-old pattern in a very old Earth suddenly flips around. Look everyone, I think deonyi is trying to communicate! :)

VGoing down a path toward retiring early, whether you\u2019re in the middle of your career and looking to just shave a few years off or you\u2019re early in your career and looking to shave off a decade or two, is like running a very long footrace on uneven ground. You can see that amazing finish line in your head, but there\u2019s a lot of ground to cover first and some real potential for something unexpected to happen.\u000a This post originally appeared on The Simple Dollar. Almost all financial success that we experience in life comes from thinking through the options carefully and making a smart decision. This is true from the small stuff, such as whether to buy store brand pasta or not, to the big stuff like, well, retiring early. If the idea of spending below your income level throughout your career in exchange for the ability to retire early or increase your career options later is an appealing one to you \u2014 and it is very appealing to me \u2014 then I encourage you to think through these five key things very carefully. I would be \u201cretired\u201d right now if I did not have children. Because Sarah and I chose to have children, my \u201cretirement\u201d will probably come shortly after our youngest graduates from high school, and he\u2019s in early elementary school. That\u2019s a pretty big change, but it reflects the reality and the expense of having children. I don\u2019t regret the choice to have children, but I\u2019m also not in denial about the financial impact they have had on our life. Unless you\u2019re neglectful, children come with a lot of expenses. You\u2019re feeding and clothing and housing a child for eighteen years. You provide toiletries for that child, learning materials for that child, household supplies for that child, medical care for the child. You\u2019re also likely to buy the child gifts and treats at various points. There\u2019s also the impact that having a child has on your career. You\u2019re going to wind up taking time off for your child. Your child is going to devour spare time that you might have otherwise used on a side gig or on self improvement or on career advancement. Your child is also going to eat into your sleep time, especially when the child is young, but also during the teen years. That\u2019s not to say that having a child isn\u2019t rewarding. It is very rewarding. However, those rewards are very personal in nature and don\u2019t show up in a financial balance sheet. If you\u2019re considering having children \u2014 or already have children \u2014 and you\u2019re also considering early retirement, you need to recognise that the presence of children will slow down your progress toward that goal. Take that into consideration when making either decision. If I look up and down the block we live on, virtually everyone has newer cars than we do. Our two vehicles are currently seven and thirteen years old and the oldest vehicle owned by any of our neighbours, by our best estimation, is also about seven years old. We drive the old cars on our block, in other words. My children are close friends with a few kids on the block and they all have neat toys and gadgets that far outstrip what our own children have. The same goes for the adults in each house, too. The thing is, I could get really worked up over this. I could feel jealous about it and want to buy a new car or a bunch of new gadgets to \u201ckeep up.\u201d But why? How does that really fulfil what I want out of life? Even though I have that perspective, there are still times when I feel pangs of jealousy. I sometimes want to have all of the things that they have, even though I know in a broader sense that I am making the best choice for me in the long term. You\u2019ll have to deal with that contradiction constantly, and when you choose to \u201ckeep up with the Joneses\u201d \u2014 or keep up with people in your social group or keep up with people in your online communities \u2014 you\u2019re going to end up paying the price in terms of achieving your early retirement goals. Buying things that you personally value is fine, but when that value is hyperinflated by a desire to \u201ckeep up,\u201d it\u2019s a purchase that ends up not having much lasting value. Mastering this idea is harder than it sounds, but it\u2019s essential for early retirement. Many people fill their life with little treats, like stopping at a coffee shop to pick up a morning latte and a bagel or stopping at a bookstore regularly or stopping at a convenience store in the evening to pick up a six pack of beer. Often, people consume far more \u201clittle treats\u201d than they think they do. These little treats are often very forgettable, in that they\u2019re low cost, consumed quickly (or just added to collections without a second thought), and then completely forgotten within an hour or two. The catch is that the costs of these little treats add up, while at the same time the frequency and forgettability of these treats makes them essentially meaningless in terms of providing lasting pleasure. They provide a very small, very short term burst of pleasure in exchange for a chunk of your future. The best solution is not to give up \u201ctreats,\u201d but spread them out so that you also get joy out of the anticipation and they\u2019re no longer forgettable. You can get almost as much joy out of a monthly visit to a coffee shop, for example, than you do out of a daily stop, because that monthly stop is a genuine treat and feels special. Mastering that distinction and breaking away from the daily and weekly routines that center around little treats is a very big key in any financial turnaround, but many people choose to frame that change as utter misery. Without it, however, the resources you need for early retirement just flow right out of your pockets without building any kind of future for yourself and, at the same time, you\u2019re sacrificing the anticipation and the \u201cspecialness\u201d of many of the treats in your life. It\u2019s a difficult shift, but a necessary one. In fact, you\u2019re probably better off just keeping your plans to yourself in mixed company, because you\u2019ll almost always be greeted with disbelief and strange criticism when you mention your plans. Most people simply don\u2019t accept that early retirement is even possible for themselves or for someone at their approximate income level. You can\u2019t possibly retire early if you\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck. Also, many are saving for a normal retirement or even a slightly late retirement. The idea that someone is doing something different is usually met with a pretty critical response, and you need to accept that you\u2019re going to hear some criticism \u2014 most of it unfounded \u2014 if you choose this route. People will basically tell you that early retirement is impossible or imply that you must be living like a hermit when neither one is remotely true. Don\u2019t let such criticism bother you, but be aware that it will come. Know how to handle it politely. My typical response is that even if things don\u2019t work out exactly like I want, I\u2019m pretty happy with my life right now and I will have plenty for a traditional retirement. Let\u2019s say you do retire early. You\u2019re done working at, say, age 50 or so. What are you going to do then? At that point, you have more than three decades left in your life, most of which should involve pretty good health. You suddenly have tons of free time. How will you fill it? The reason for thinking about this question now rather than later is that, if you don\u2019t have a good vision for this time, why are you retiring early? Without some kind of a plan for the years after retiring, it\u2019s kind of fruitless to retire early. For me, retirement is more of a tool to launch another career path, one that won\u2019t necessarily earn a lot of money but will provide a lot of personal enjoyment. The day when I walk away from \u201cwork\u201d isn\u2019t a day when I become idle. It\u2019s a day when I leap into new plans. What are your plans? And, if you don\u2019t have those plans, why are you retiring early? Early retirement isn\u2019t an easy path. It\u2019s one that\u2019s fraught with temptations and distractions and big questions about why you\u2019re even doing this. Thinking about those things early on, before they\u2019re in the way of your progress, can make all the difference between success and failure. Let these ideas be food for thought for you as you think about your own journey toward retirement, early or otherwise.

Available on iTunes for iPad and iPhone users, it is a very safe app in respect of its cash flow, and gives players around the world a real poker experience. The kind of experience you have depends of course on your skills, and for that you need to learn the game since poker is a game that requires knowledge, and skilful decision making abilities in real time.  One thing that drew our attention to this app is the fact that there are around 10 million registered users online, which means you are never alone at any point of time. The 888poker NJ app gives you the option to play, buff, bet, raise, and at the end win real money that you can get through a pay out. Once you register you are offered a free game and a bonus award of $10 to start the game for free.  This means that from the start you do not need to use your own money. Not only that, but if you play well, you may never have to invest any money in the app. Of course the app offers real money gaming as well, which is available when you are in New Jersey. It is quite easy to withdraw the money if you are playing real cash poker game. The safe and secure payment option will keep your money safe.

One of the advantages of playing with this app is that it is available 24/7 and you can play during your leisure time. There are multiple table tournaments to take part in which gives you a lot of game options to choose from. This app is secure and respects the privacy of its users. Another important aspect is that the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement has licensed the game for people in New Jersey; NJ started offering legal online poker to five distinct networks: WSOP, 888, Ultimate, Party / Borgata and Betfair.  This app is available to users that are over 21, want to have fun and like playing Poker. We have noticed that there are instances in which it takes time for the game to start. If  that happens to you just switch to other games such as blackjack and roulette tables until the connection is fixed.  It is obvious but let\u2019s make it clear, you need an Internet connection at every stage of the game, so if you don\u2019t want to get disconnected in the middle of a game, make sure your Wi-Fi or your phone internet is working. You can download the 888poker NJ app from the App Store for Free. \u000a Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VHaving to close a tab with audio blaring from an auto-play ad is one of the web\u2019s greatest annoyances, but at the same time, most of us want to hear videos coming from YouTube or Netflix. How do you mute one without the other? Fortunately, there are a couple of easy solutions available.\u000a The major browsers now let you mute tabs manually, but it can be a time-consuming process, especially if you\u2019ve got dozens of tabs open and don\u2019t know where the sounds are springing from. Third-party extension make managing sound from multiple tabs much easier. The first add-on we want to highlight is MuteLinks for Firefox. You can set up a blacklist of sites that really should have no business playing audio while leaving the option open for other tabs. You can even use wildcards and specify certain subdomains if you need to. MuteLinks for Firefox Pick Add-ons from the main Firefox menu, then select Options next to MuteLinks to use it. The bottom field, Blacklist sites, lets you specify sites you don\u2019t want to hear from, and the explanatory text above shows you how to specify subdomains and use special characters as wildcards. Over on Chrome Mute Tabs by URL does a very similar job for Google\u2019s web browser and adds a whitelist. Click the extension icon, and you can type out URLs manually or use the buttons to add sites that you currently have open. To remove a site from either the whitelist or the blacklist, just delete it as you would in a text editor. Meanwhile MuteTab is just about the most comprehensive solution for Google Chrome. You can mute specific URLs, background tabs, incognito tabs, and more besides. Click the extension icon to open it, then use the icons to the side to add sites to the blacklist or the whitelist. MuteTab for Chrome Select Options to see the lists that are set up and add or remove sites as required. You can set up default muting behaviour too \u2014 for instance, if you want background tabs to always be muted unless you say otherwise, that\u2019s one of the options here. Smart Tab Mute uses the approach of only keeping the active tab unmuted, which may work better for you, and it\u2019s available for Chrome and Firefox. It works automatically once installed. Click the Smart Tab Mute icon and choose Options from the pop-up menu if you want to specify URLs that the extension should ignore. Those extensions should be enough to get you started but they\u2019re not the only way of tackling audio that appears out of nowhere and interrupts whatever it is you\u2019re doing. You can also try disabling auto-playing videos completely in your browser, so nothing starts until you\u2019re ready to view (and hear) it.

p512
V\u201cMy brand new Note7 exploded this morning while I was still asleep, it was plugged in and charging,\u201d writes Melbourne Redditor Crushader, in what appears to be Australia\u2019s first case of a Samsung Galaxy Note7 being destroyed due to a recently discovered battery defect, \u201c[Samsung] told me this is the first case in Australia\u201d. While Samsung isn\u2019t elaborating on the incident, which allegedly occurred in a Perth hotel room, a replacement phone has been supplied via a Samsung store and the company is covering the $1800 hotel damages bill according to Crushader. \u201cPhone completely fried, I can\u2019t eject the sim tray to retrieved my sim or the SD card. I was using original charger and cable if you are wondering. Charred the hotel room bed sheet and the carpet when I whacked it down to the floor, burnt one of my finger while doing that too,\u201d Crushader explains in the post. Samsung recently announced a full recall of the devices, advising owners to switch off their phones and return them to where they were purchased in return for a temporary replacement phone.  Crushader echoed this in the Reddit post.  \u201cPlease do not use the phone anymore, it is dangerous and not worth the risk. I knew of the recall and lodged my application with Samsung as soon as they announced officially on Friday, and now 3 days later it has happened to me\u201d. Samsung has stated it is aware of the incident, ans an investigation into \u201ca very small number of reported incidents with the Galaxy Note7\u201d has commenced. Hopefully Telstra are taking the recall seriously: this model was given a full page ad in Telstra's print catalogue released today. I guess marketing knows best. Glad the owner escaped relatively unscathed though.  Question: have the US Transport Safety Administration made the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 illegal to carry on to planes yet? I know they've been terribly worried about water, so it seems only natural that an explodey phone should probably make the list too. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 4:20 pm								 I got a text from Telstra today saying bring it in and they will give me a replacement phone until the Note 7 is available again. Samsung issues a recall on the phone\u000aGuy continues to use phone and it blows up........ better get a story out of this and post to reddit asap..... i'm more surprised at the $1800 carpet bill. Are they replacing the carpet in the whole room? Absolutely. It'll be one piece of carpet in the whole room. The hotel won't settle for a patchwork, and quite frankly, neither would I in my home. Every room is one piece. you are not supposed to leave any phone on charger over night unattended. ive got a note 7 and make sure its charged before i go to bed, it only drops 1 or 2% over night. although, im going to swap back to my note edge this evening, save my self some possible grief. c'mon mate, I would think most of us do. The ritual for me is to plug in the phone, set it on my bedside table, hop into bed and go to sleep. Every single night. I wan't 100% charge walking out the door in the morning. i know lots of people do it. and a fair few people fall asleep, while the phone is plugged in, while laying in bed, using an app, or something that drains the battery while its being charged. now, the problem lies in 2 places here.  1) apps, especially game apps, tend to be battery hungry, meaning they will have a higher load on the battery drawing more amps then say no intensive apps running - the problem with this is, whilst charging at the same rate as a battery is actively being discharged - the charger tries to compensate and will either increase voltage slightly, or increase amperage, or both. when this happens, heat is generated. the main killer of lithium batteries is heat. which leads to  2) when you fall asleep looking at your phone on charge, whilst using your device, it usually falls onto your mattress, to which you then, cover it in your sleep, or roll on top of it. not always, but it can happen. ive done it, and i know that anyone that uses their phone in bed at night has done it, at least once. in my case, on a older phone (Note Edge), i woke up to my phone burning my back due to the heat it was emitting due to me laying on it. luckily, it didnt burst into flames.  unfortunately, lithium as a chemical reacts quite violently under hot conditions. i used to work in a battery world store for 7 years, and we used to deal in lithium batteries for phones, digital cameras and video cameras and i have seen first hand what happens to lithium batteries when they are either discharged very quickly (causes large amounts of heat, which makes the chemical expand - which in older phones with removable backs, is ok, coz it just pushes the back off the phone and the battery can expand, BUT - newer, sealed phones, they expand internally and coz they cant force their way out of the casing around them, the pop or pierce and burst into flames) there is also a lot of debate back and forth about what charge state you charge you phone batteries up to as well, but that is a whole another kettle of fish. but basically, the higher the percentage you charge you battery to, the less charge cycles you will get out of it. at battery university (the website) they say at charging to 100% (which is most practical for everyone because we need them to last a whole day at least) you will get roughly 300 to 500 charge cycles, and a decrease in overall capacity over that time. but at 50% charge capacity (not overly practical for most people) you can get anywhere between 2000 and 4000 charge cycles. and the last point ill make about batteries (not really to do with the points above or the article, but interesting none the less) is built in obsolescence. another thing i saw while working battery world. on the odd occasion we would have military grade hardware come in whether lithium batteries, lead acid batteries or nickel based batteries and they had stopped working after 3 or 4 times the working life of consumer grade batteries of the same chemical composition.  eg a lead acid tank battery (a starter batter) that had only just stopped working after 20 years old. I've always left my phone charging overnight at my bedside.\u000aI have not seen anything anywhere stating that I should not be doing this. Same... phones have it built in that once the battery is at 100% they switch it so the phone is powered through the charger leaving the battery alone so it doesn't overheat and catch fire. Not in the Galaxy Note 7. Lols. You're not supposed to build and sell phones that explode and catch fire either, so I guess they're both at fault. i never said it wasnt the manufacturers fault. Very true. It's an absoutley imbecilic thing to do. Any device can catch fire and explode when left charging like that, especially something small capacity like a phone.\u000aThere's a fault with these which makes it guaranteed so that guy was especially moronic. I wonder if Apple's going to play a dirty tricks campaign like Samsung does everytime Apple put their foot in it somehow and Samsung's about to release a new phone? "iPhone 7, it'll blow your mind, not your bedside table!" Nah doubt it. Though it would be all too easy to capitalize on for them if they did. What timing. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 5:22 pm								 Samsung sells remaining Note 7 to US military as flat grenades Does anyone know if samsung are using the same batteries in the s7 edge? That would be a major cause for concern for current owners Completely different battery. The Note7 battery is unique to that model of phone. 6pm this evening from Samsung; Sydney, Australia \u2013 September 6, 2016 \u2013 Samsung Electronics Australia can verify two Galaxy Note7 smartphones in Australia have suffered from the reported battery cell issue. This includes an incident in Perth, WA, that was reported by a customer from Victoria.\u000aSamsung Electronics Australia recently announced a recall of Galaxy Note7 smartphones in Australia.

VThe European Space Agency lost contact with its Rosetta mission\u2019s plucky little lander, Philae, in May 2015. Now the orbiter\u2019s high-resolution camera has found Philae wedged into a dark crack on the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.\u000a\u000aRosetta\u2019s high-resolution camera found the Philae lander wedged into a dark crack on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. (Main image, lander inset: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for OSIRIS Team MPS/UPD/LAM/IAA/SSO/INTA/UPM/DASP/IDA; context: ESA/Rosetta/ NavCam \u2014 CC BY-SA IGO 3.0) Landing a small craft on a moving comet was always an incredibly ambitious mission, but the Rosetta team pulled it off in November 2014, with a few hiccups that ultimately resulted in losing contact with Philae. As Gizmodo\u2019s Maddie Stone reported in January: \u000aWhen the lander touched down in November of 2014, it bounced twice, and wound up in the dark shadow of a cliff. Without enough sunlight to charge its solar panels, Philae quickly exhausted its power supply. Within 57 hours, it had fallen silent.\u000a\u000aSix months later, as Comet 67P approached the sun, Philae briefly woke from its slumber and phoned home. Then, it went quiet again. The DLR\u2019s Philae team hasn\u2019t heard a peep since.\u000a Rosetta\u2019s scientists could only narrow the range of Philae\u2019s final resting place based on radio ranging data from its final transmissions. But while they found a few possible locations, the images were not of sufficiently high resolution to confirm with confidence that the lander had been found. On September 2, Rosetta\u2019s orbit passed sufficiently closet the comet\u2019s surface for its Osiris narrow-angle camera to capture a high-resolution image of the lander\u2019s body and two of its three legs: Image: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for OSIRIS Team MPS/UPD/LAM/IAA/SSO/INTA/UPM/DASP/IDA As Comet 67P/C-G heads away from the Sun and towards the orbit of Jupiter, there will be less and less solar energy available to power Rosetta and its instruments. So mission planners will crash the probe into the comet in a slow, controlled descent on September 30. All the while, Rosetta\u2019s instruments will be feverishly collecting and transmitting data, hopefully giving up some spectacular close-up shots of this extraordinary comet. That's not Philae....that's Michael Jackson!! =]

p516
VWell, this is a Lifehacker story I never thought I\u2019d have to write. It\u2019s a beautiful story of man takes shower. Man sits down in shower. Man gets testicles stuck in chair. Man miraculously gets his balls out of said precarious situation. The man in question: Claus Jørstad of Norway. Claus made an interesting post on the IKEA Facebook page.  Apparently Claus has a knee injury, meaning that he finds it difficult to stand in the shower. His solution: an Ikea Marius stool.  Claus sits on this thing, relaxes, and gets his shower time in. There\u2019s only one problem: his testicles. According to the Facebook post, Claus managed to get one of his testicles stuck in a hole on on the Marius chair. Which begs the question: how does one remove their testicles from an IKEA chair? The solution was accidental but, in hindsight, complete genius. Cold water.  As the story goes, Claus simply sat rigid in the chair, thinking long and hard about life minus a testicle. Eventually the water from the shower ran cold, which cause the requisite amount of scrotal shrinkage required for him to stand up with both of his testicles intact. Amazing.  So, today\u2019s Lifehack: if you ever find yourself in the shower, with your testicles lodged in an Ikea chair, you know what to do. Turn off the hot water, let your balls shrink and you\u2019re a free man.  Testicles don't work that way. The size of the testicles doesn't shrink in cold water, only the skin surrounding them does You might say it was a teste-ing time for him. sounds like a (ball)sackable offence that guy's nuts, if he sits on a chair with holes in it in the nude. Ikea should consider this man, and any naturists who may become trapped in a similar fashion.\u000aSome building codes for fences demand a small gap between posts, to ensure children can't stick their head through (and get stuck in a similar fashion). I want Ikea to release a "testicle friendly" version of the stool. With publicity to match. No photos. So this didn't happen You have to wonder how "accidental" this "accident" was. Personally, I have not found that my junk just happen to fall into a hole that is small enough to get one of them stuck.

p518
VIt\u2019s Star Trek\u2018s 50th anniversary, and while I could wax rhapsodic about the impact the show had on me in general, one thing that persists, even now, every day, is how much I learned how to be a good leader by watching Starfleet captains. Sometimes they were exceptional. Other times they really weren\u2019t. I always learned something.\u000a I grew up watching Star Trek: The Next Generation, and dropped everything to watch Deep Space Nine when it aired. I remember Voyager\u2018s first episode when it aired, and being one of the very few people put off by (but not totally hating) the opening theme for Enterprise. I will happily admit that everything I learned about leadership and managing people I learned from Benjamin Sisko and Jean-Luc Picard. I learned to be firm when I had to, to be diplomatic even when I don\u2019t want to be, and to be thorny when it counts. I learned to pick my battles, fight on my own terms, and to trust when that trust is earned. Here are a few more things I picked up.  There\u2019s something about being second in command that gives you a level of freedom and flexibility that being on top of the chain doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s more relaxed, and while it\u2019s still an important job, it doesn\u2019t come with the same weight that being in command does. That said, when it\u2019s your turn to step into the spotlight, you need to do it. In The Best of Both Worlds, the epic season three/four cliffhanger that had Commander Riker in the big chair squared off against Picard-now-Locutus with the fate of the Federation and Earth itself hanging in the balance, Riker says as much when Guinan essentially storms into the Ready Room \u2014 right when he actually needs her, even when he doesn\u2019t know it. She reminds him (in the video above) that the only way for him to move forward \u2014 or for him to do what he needs to do \u2014 is to let go of Picard \u2014 something he proceeds to do at the end of the episode. The lesson here is pretty clear. Make your own calls, stand by your own decisions, and don\u2019t whither wondering \u201cwhat would X do if they were still here?\u201d The more you do, and the more you second guess yourself, the more you\u2019ll fail, the more the people around you will wonder what your vision is, what your direction is, and what your style of command is.  Even we, as viewers, got the same message in Q-Less, an episode in the first season of Deep Space Nine, when the show was still doing its fair share of coattail-riding off of the popularity of The Next Generation. In the video above however, we as an audience (and Q, as a character, standing in for us) get the message loud and clear: Sisko isn\u2019t Picard, and we shouldn\u2019t expect him to be. It wasn\u2019t the best episode \u2014 in fact that scene wasn\u2019t even the best scene. It\u2019s problematic in all sorts of ways, but the message is absolutely clear: Deep Space Nine wasn\u2019t going to be the same as the series that came before it, and luckily for all of us, not too long after the first season, that coattail riding stopped and the show started to evolve on its own.  If you put five dollars away for every time a Starfleet captain violated the Prime Directive, or bent (or flat out violated) rules and regulations for their own ends, you\u2019d have enough money to retire on. That\u2019s no surprise to any Star Trek fan, but the one consistent message across every series and every character is that the rules are there for a reason \u2014 but sometimes they\u2019re worth breaking. In The First Duty, after the equivalent of a detective procedural at Starfleet Academy (seriously, why have we never had an Academy-based show?) Picard leans in to then-cadet Crusher over his lie of omission, reminding him that his commitment to Starfleet is also a commitment to the truth, in every form. Of course, it\u2019s an inspirational and tense moment, but it\u2019s a reminder to the rest of us too \u2014 Picard has bent the truth more than once himself and we all know it \u2014 but flexible ethics are only flexible when you\u2019re doing what you think is right, not when what you think is fun, or even flashy or grandiose.  In contrast, one of my favourite episodes of Deep Space Nine, and indeed one of my favourite episodes of television in general, In the Pale Moonlight, this spectacular monologue at the end sums up exactly the kind of inner conflict that comes with being enough of a realist to know that the idealism in an episode like The First Duty only extends so far \u2014 and when you have to reach beyond it for real, true greater good (or do you?) there\u2019s no looking back.  Then there\u2019s the wild opposite extreme, when you\u2019re so busy doing what you think is right that you don\u2019t consider the implications of your actions. In the Voyager two-parter Equinox, we saw an example of what happens when all of those guiding principles get thrown out the window \u2014 partially because of necessity, but also because those ethics are flimsier than they should be. The crew of the Equinox essentially imprison and slowly kill members of another species to use as fuel, and when they run into Voyager, it\u2019s not too long before their secret is exposed, and everyone pays the price for it. It\u2019s a classic example of rationalizing away your own ethical violations because the ends justify the means. Of course, it all comes around in the end, though, doesn\u2019t it? But again, that\u2019s the core message, and the takeaway: Stand by your principles. Make the best decisions you can, and let your ethics guide you. Until, of course, you need to deviate from them to do what you think \u2014 and you really, really, need to think \u2014 is the right thing to do. Maybe it\u2019s for the greater good, maybe it\u2019s for your team, maybe it\u2019s for the people you serve. But you need to know when your own personal code of ethics are the pillars on which you stand, and when they\u2019re chains you need to break because they\u2019re holding you back \u2014 and you\u2019d better be willing to stand by them in either case.  Trust is earned, not given, but when you have people that you need to work with, you need to be able to trust them, at least to the degree where you let them do their jobs, do what they know best, and let them succeed or fail on their own \u2014 and then examining that success or failure when it happens. Praise and criticism both have a place when it comes to leading people, and it\u2019s especially important when you let them act independently. This isn\u2019t same as being laissez-faire with the people you work with, however, or setting them up to fail (or knowing they\u2019re going to fail) and then just saying \u201cI told you so,\u201d when they do. It\u2019s about learning the line between trusting someone when they seem passionate to pull off what they want to do, and knowing when it won\u2019t work out. In Legacy, a season 4 episode of The Next Generation, the crew of the Enterprise stumble on Ishara Yar, the sister of their fallen (too soon) security chief, Tasha Yar. They laugh, they cry, they get close to her\u2026and she betrays them. She (supposedly) doesn\u2019t mean to hurt them, but we get a tough lesson on trust in that episode, and how hard it can be to recover when you\u2019ve been betrayed.  In the same vein, in the original series episode Assignment: Earth, we get a lesson in how rewarding it can be when you, against all odds, actually choose to trust someone to do what\u2019s right and reveal their better nature, even if you\u2019re not sure what their nature actually is. When it\u2019s earned, that trust is extremely powerful. In the last episode of Voyager, Janeway asks old Harry Kim to \u201ctrust her judgement, one last time,\u201d right when it counts \u2014 and frankly, it pays off. But that\u2019s the kicker. Learning to trust is important, and giving people the leeway to achieve, accomplish their goals, and make their own mistakes are both important, and as they prove worthy of that trust, you can let them take bigger risks and gamble on more critical decisions. You learn when you can trust their intuition, just as they learn. But in every case, whether they succeed or fail, you need to hold them accountable for their decisions. Whether that means praising their good work, or reflecting on their failures. It\u2019s the only way any of us improve, grow, and learn when we can trust our guts, and when we need help.  At the end of The Next Generation, in the finale, All Good Things, one of the things that Picard laments in the closing scene is that he never took the time to get closer to his crew, as much as he always wanted to. He felt like he had to keep a certain distance, a theme echoed in a number of other series as well. Where Picard kept his distance, Janeway felt, in the Voyager season one episode The Cloud, that after getting stranded in the Delta Quadrant, that she had a responsibility to try to get closer to her crew, even if it was difficult for her (and awkward for them) to do so.  That\u2019s the thing with being in charge in any organisation: You have to keep a healthy distance from the people you work with, and especially the people who work for you. You need to be available to them, hear their concerns and their ideas, and always be willing to provide feedback \u2014 perhaps not in the near-parental way that Starfleet captains always managed to be \u2014 but always a confidant, always a leader, but never quite a peer. Plus, the only way to maintain or create an air of authority is to actually be the authority people need when they need it. It\u2019s difficult to do so if you\u2019re so mired in personal relationships that it\u2019s difficult to use good judgement. That same episode also, even though it was way early in Voyager\u2019s run, exemplified the importance of why it\u2019s critical to have a great, trustworthy person at your side to help you run things \u2014 someone you can actually confide in, and of course, why the best leaders are the ones that are hungry and optimistically curious about the work they do, and want to jump on that work whenever they possibly can.  Finally, and possibly one of the most important lessons you can learn about working with (and leading) people from Star Trek is that being you should always keep an open mind, be willing to entertain options, but then never apologise for making your own judgement call \u2014 even if that means you ditch the options and follow your gut. After all, that\u2019s one of the defining characteristics of leadership. You have to examine the options in front of you, consider the ones that aren\u2019t in front of you, and make what you think is the best call based on the available information at the time \u2014 even when, as in All Good Things, the series finale to The Next Generation \u2014 you\u2019re the only one who really understands, and everyone else questions your judgement. When you make your call, stand by it unless you get new information that forces you to change course \u2014 and sometimes that new information can be really, really painful to accept, but correcting your own mistakes is better than losing everything sticking to your guns when the tide turns against you. Even then, don\u2019t apologise for making your decision \u2014 you did it with the best intentions and the best information, and as long as you do so with your best and clearest judgement, you\u2019ll have nothing to apologise for. With luck, the people around you will trust your judgement. Their trust is earned too, so don\u2019t expect it to come granted just because you have authority. Sometimes people will agree with you, and sometimes people will wonder if you\u2019re crazy, but it\u2019s more important to remember, as Janeway says, if you can\u2019t trust yourself, who can you trust?

VAre you gonna say no to a man with unbreakable skin? As this totally fantastic clip shows, that\u2019s probably not the smartest idea.  If our spoiler-free preview of what\u2019s to come in Marvel and Netflix\u2019s Luke Cage didn\u2019t have you champing at the bit to see more of this show, this brief new clip just might, showing just what a force of nature Luke can be in a fight. If you\u2019ve got enhanced strength and nigh-on invulnerability, why bother with finesse?  Man, the fights in this show are going to be a lot of fun. Luke Cage drops on Netflix September 30th.

VGood news for the undeserving people of Twitter.com: Leslie Jones has, again, returned to bless us with her tweets.\u000a The Ghostbusters actress has had quite a saga with the social media platform. In July, she briefly quit after Breitbart tech blogger Milo Yiannopolous got his alt-right army of Twitter monsters to inundate her with racist and misogynist tweets back. Twitter, in response, booted Yiannopolous off the platform. Hackers then took over Jones\u2019s website, posting nude pictures of the star, along with images of her passport and driver\u2019s licence. After that, she again disappeared from Twitter. Jones resurfaced this Saturday, tweeting about the Golden Girls and a weird Cinnamon Toast Crunch commercial. The reason for her return? Ok y'all must know I celebrate the whole week of my bday. Use to the whole month but I was young then lol. Now I just want to have fun!! \u2014 Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) September 4, 2016  Thanks to my fans and friends! I'm soooooo ok really. And I will always be funny been through a lot in my life and I ALWAYS GET BACK UP! \u2014 Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) September 4, 2016  So let's make my birthday week THE BOMB!! Cause I'm about to act a fool YALL!! CHEAH! #LJBDAY \u2014 Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) September 4, 2016  Happy birthday Leslie! May you be rewarded with more tweets from people like Julian, and less harassment from white nationalists! Ok Julian you are so precious I will put this on my board at work!! pic.twitter.com/W1DFlAkNdC \u2014 Leslie Jones (@Lesdoggg) August 8, 2016  [H/T BuzzFeed] Terrible, untrue story. Milo did not direct anyone to attack her, and the only thing he did himself was criticize her movie. Maybe you could construe some sexist/racists things from his twitter feed, but go have a look at Leslie Jones twitter feed. SHE DOES THE EXACT SAME THING.\u000aLeslie did not deserve most of the horrible things that were said and done to/about her, but if you had actually looked into this story a little bit, investigated the feud between Milo and Leslie, you would have found that she has tweeted some pretty terrible things too.\u000aI am not a fan of either of these people, but in this instance, Milo was punished for having an opinion about a movie, and blamed for the actions of others. Twitter applied a double standard to the situation, banning Milo and not Leslie for the same behavior. Leslie did not deserve most of the horrible things... Only some of the horrible things, right? Ridiculous. Do you believe that a standup comedian with 30-year's experience was emotionally scarred by mean comments? Wrong question. Do I think that person deserves any of the horrible things? No. Is it the wrong question because you'd prefer to avoid answering it? Yup, definitely the wrong question.  Not going to provide justification for why I think it's shit for a group of people to abusively dogpile someone on a social media service. Should be obvious why some people don't want to be horrid nutsacks. I do, in fact, wish ill on deceitful people.\u000aAlso, on people without the courage to answer a simple question... It's uncomfortable, isn't it?\u000aIf this actor was not distraught, but was instead, acting;\u000aThat would mean she'd dishonestly manipulated the media to silence an effective opponent of her ideology. If you don't believe a 30-year standup comedian was genuinely distraught by mean tweets, your post makes you complicit. Very uncomfortable. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 8:39 am								 When people called her a hypocrite, she deserved it.\u000aWhen people called her racist, she deserved it.\u000aWhen people called her a liar, she deserved it.\u000aWhen people called her out for telling her fans to attacks someone else, she deserved it. I wonder if she will stop racially abusing white people on Twitter this time around. I'm having trouble keeping up, this week is she:\u000a1: A strong professional comedian?\u000aor\u000a2: An emotionally shattered victim?

VThe more propellers and motors you add to a drone, the more weight it can lift. Freefly Systems\u2019 Alta 8, designed to carry heavy video equipment, has eight rotors making it strong enough to tow a surfer on a wakeboard. Say hello to the new sport of dronesurfing where waves aren\u2019t necessary.\u000a Is this even possible? Standing on the beach the drone probably isn\u2019t strong enough to pull the surfer off his feet. But as you can see in the video, that\u2019s why he had to get a running start and hop on the wakeboard for the stunt to work. Does a massive drone like this have enough strength to maintain the surfer\u2019s forward momentum on a low-friction lake? Without a doubt. In fact, we\u2019ve seen similar stunts like this before, including a kid being pulled on a snowboard by a drone that\u2019s considerably smaller than this one.  [YouTube]

VFor those of us who can\u2019t bear the thought of spending just a few minutes away from our social networks, let alone an entire night, our bedside smartphones double as an adequate alarm clock. But for those who are able to disconnect at bedtime, Lexon\u2019s In-Out clock is a minimal but cleverly functional way to ensure your alarm is set before you drift off to sleep.\u000a Setting the time is made super easy with a pair of giant plus and minus buttons on the back for advancing the hours and minutes. And instead of having to deal with multiple button presses to set the alarm, a smaller LCD display pops-up on top with plus and minus buttons of its own on the back. When the smaller secondary display is up, your alarm is ready to go, and when it\u2019s down, it won\u2019t go off. For $US45 ($59) it\u2019s an easy way to ensure you won\u2019t accidentally sleep in come the morning, and it\u2019s available in a slew of fun colours to help match your room\u2019s decor. [Lexon via Bookofjoe]  I like my Sony alarm clock, which displays two alarms simultaneously; allowing you to set and toggle on/off for each preset. Even has a DST button, so you don't need to manually move the clock back/forward. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 6:12 am								 Good design

VWant to monitor just how efficiently you are sleeping? Of course you do. Misfit has announced an upgrade to its sleep monitor and mobile app, Misfit Beddit Smart and Beddit 2.0. With the new version, smart-measuring functionality enables users to measure sleep automatically with no interaction required at all. This makes collecting long-term sleep data a whole lot easier, which is the most important factor for understanding sleep. So how does it workThe Misfit Beddit Smart sensor is installed under the bed sheet and the Beddit 2.0 mobile app will do the rest. A connection between the mobile app and sensor will be initiated whenever an iOS-device is placed in Bluetooth range and the sensor detects there\u2019s someone sleeping on it. Users don\u2019t need to manually trigger a sleep monitoring session, however those who prefer the old way can still opt for manual activation. \u201cWhile Misfit Beddit Smart provides important hardware upgrades for faster pairing and draining less battery from a mobile device, the most important new feature is the smart-measuring. We\u2019ve received feedback that users want to monitor their sleep in the long-term but simply forget to activate it on a nightly basis. We have now solved this problem, so that users can truly focus on sleeping better.\u201d said Beddit CEO, Lasse Leppakorpi. In addition, Misfit Beddit\u2019s leading edge sleep data has been improved further. The Beddit 2.0 app update provides a thorough visual renovation along with new features such as: \u25cf      Short-term sleep history \u2013 helps keep track of sleep rhythm and trends.  \u25cf      Sleep remarks \u2013 compares nightly data to averages. \u25cf      Sleep efficiency \u2013 is a user sleeping well when in bed?

V Bike envy has been taken to a new level, with the launch of made-to-order model by Ted Baker and small artisan bicycle firm Quella. The two British companies have teamed up to create the Italian-inspired racer, which is available in \u201cRedfinn, Bluetail or Greengill\u201d colour from £1995. The stylishly retro bicycles feature a unique copper-plated design over a fine steel frame, as well as leather-taped traditional curved drop bars. In keeping with their top-of-the-range aesthetic, they\u2019ve also been equipped with exceptional racing components by Campagnolo and Dia Compe. Described as \u201ca thoroughly modern take on an Italian classic\u201d, each bike is individually hand-crafted by Quella \u2013 which, rather charmingly, operates out of a former chicken shed in the Cambridgeshire countryside. Aptly perhaps Cambridge has the high proportion of cyclists compared to the rest of the UK.    Ted Baker is well-known for its aesthetic collaborations, and we keep a close eye out for them here at Tech Digest. The company\u2019s name has been associated with beautiful phone cases and audio products, amongst other things, in the past 18 months. The Ted Baker-Quella bicycles are available to buy now for £1,995 from the new Ted Baker & Moore store on Commercial Street, London, or on Quella\u2019s website.

p532
VWe eat fish and throw away the scales. But now researchers have figured out a reason those fish scales might be worth saving.\u000a\u000aFish market (Image: Gregg_TLV) A new paper out in Applied Physics Letters today details a method for transforming fish scales into an energy harvester. Researchers processed the raw scales to make them flexible and then attached two electrodes to each scale before laminating it. The resulting cell could then harvest energy from movement around it, including motion as simple as just vibrations or even a heartbeat. This has researchers suggesting that they could one day use it to power things like pacemakers. \u201cIn the future, our goal is to implant a bio-piezoelectric nanogenerator into a heart for pacemaker devices, where it will continuously generate power from heartbeats for the device\u2019s operation,\u201d co-author of the paper Dipankar Mandal of Jadavpur University explained in a statement. \u201cThen it will degrade when no longer needed.\u201d That particular application is fairly far off, but the research is an important reminder that there may be a better use for the incredible amount of food waste we\u2019re generating \u2014 four million tonnes every year in Australia alone. A lot of that wasted food is readily-edible stuff that just gets tossed. But there are also inedible byproducts like fish scales and orange peels that could be put to productive use with a little creativity. \u201cThe fish scale is available in large quantity in our society because it is basically bio-waste component and thrown away in food processing,\u201d co-author Sujoy Kumar Ghosh told Gizmodo. To get the scales they used, the researchers simply collected them from a local fish market. Not only is figuring out how to use non-edible food waste for other purposes cost-effective, it gives us a way to use even the parts of food we don\u2019t eat. [Applied Physics Letters]

p534
VThe 3.5mm headphone jack that has existed in audio players for 100 years is no more. Apple ditching the headphone jack had been rumoured for some time, but it was unclear what the company was going to do to replace it. In part, it\u2019s all about the Lightning port \u2014 and Lightning buds will ship with the iPhone. But the real future is AirPods, the truly wireless listening devices that look just like EarPods without the wires.\u000a The company\u2019s latest phone, the iPhone 7, will use the Lightening port on the bottom of the phone, the same one you use to charge it, instead of the headphone jack we know and love. Apple will include a pair of Lightening EarPods, as well as a Lightening-to-headphone jack dongle, in the box. Apple is touting a new W1 chip that powers the AirPods, as as well as upcoming Beats headphones. The chip will supposedly improve the performance of the headphones that utilise it, but we have yet to try it out ourselves. It seems like this case included with the AirPods is essential to their use, as the case will be used to charge and carry around the AirPods. The AirPods will have five hours of charge, while the carrying case will have 25 hours. You pair the AirPods with your iPhone by opening the case to the box. They will cost $229, which is pretty reasonable as far as wireless headphones go. Apple executive Phil Schiller justified ditching the headphone jack by saying it took \u201ccourage\u201d and that removing the headphone jack frees up space for other components in the iPhone.

Been going to gym the last three months and the cords always get in my way. I considered buying some Beats wireless, but consider these can actually be used to take calls, buts a win. I'm currently using the EarPods included with my iPhone 6 for the gym. The sound quality is perfect for podcast and answering calls, but again, the constant cord dangling is a major upset and constantly halts me when I'm at the gym. I use a pair Sony Walkman Bluetooth. They're a bit bigger, but no cord, just a behind the head band. bonus is the 16gb Walkman built in, which is 100% waterproof, which usue for swimming. I like the two separate earpieces. I used to use a JBL Synchros Reflect bluetooth set at the gym and they failed after a year when the wire joining the buds broke internally (right after end of warranty, of course). Umm you do realise that there are a lot of different wireless options for headphones right? And that some of them are even designed to use when exercising? And they are not as expensive as this? Earpods are horrible, they sit losely in my ears and constantly fall out with even the slightest of shakes. Having them now fall out and  not have something to dangle from? Disaster. That said, I'm sure Apple is expecting some thirrd party company to start selling a neck string or hooks for them, as usual. You're putting them in your ears wrong K Too easy to lose them. They need to have an ear hook option or something to keep them more secure. Maybe Apple will have a build in app - Find my Airpods ! They seem to have overlooked the fact that a fair number of people wants to listen to music AND charge their phone at the same time How so? Wireless head phones, phone charges? Where is the problem? If you use wired head phones, then charge your phone later? Like seriously I only need to charge my 6S Plus for 90mins every 48 hours, that can be done numerous times when I not only don't need the phone, but don't need anything (I'm asleep!). They look ugly af Unlike some other people the current earpods from apple are the only headphones I have found that stay in my ears.\u000aBefore anyone asks yes I have spent a lot on trying X product that everyone swears will work.\u000aI would be keen to try out the wireless version, especially if the sound quality is better then apples current offering. How do these connect? Bluetooth? Some other new protocol? Can they be used with other phones, or only the iPhone 7? I rememeber Apple being a great industrial design company, wireless headphones modelled exactly like they just cut the wires off them.  You notice NONE of the pictures have them in ear.   Oh we have a new chip in them... yeah but what is powering them bluetooth... what have they done to improve or resolve wireless headphone signal degredation and amplification in such a small design... or did they just literally cut the wire on some bluetooth optional headphones. wow, the simple praticality of carrying small objects is really obvious.\u000aPeople will be losing them in droves. kinda like cattle which is appropriate.

VGizmodo is proud to present fiction from Lightspeed Magazine. Once a month, we feature a story from Lightspeed\u2019s current issue, and this month\u2019s selection is \u201cSee the Unseeable, Know the Unknowable\u201d by Maria Dahvana Headley. You can read the story below or you can listen to the podcast. Enjoy!\u000a\u000a\u000aIllustration by Reiko Murakami We know things. We know that there are some things which possibly shouldn\u2019t be written about any longer. Possibly shouldn\u2019t be done any longer. The golden ages. They have been written, and better, performed, and better. A stranger, for example, comes to town and changes everything. Not a single stranger, but a troupe of strangers, spangled, striped, trapezed. But we love a circus. We know it\u2019s old-fashioned, but we can\u2019t resist it. That is the smell of greasepaint. We know it by now, though it still sings to us. We know how the roar of the crowd sounds. We know what the carnival refreshments taste like. We know the door that takes us to the sideshow. We\u2019ve slept on the bed of nails, and maybe, though we won\u2019t admit it, we\u2019ve fucked the two-headed goatgirl. And, yes, we know the important lessons, too. We know never to run away to join the circus. There are circus people in the real world, on the run from circuses, escaped and fled, trying to pretend they never flung themselves in to begin with. Sometimes people get away from the thing they wanted. People like that could tell you stories. In the world down here, there\u2019s a man with a belly full of flames who sometimes chokes on smoke; a tattooed lady with the universe, nebulas and black holes, comets and constellations, and all the words for light and dark that have thus far been invented, hidden up her sleeves. There\u2019s a strong man pushing a pencil across a desk. A sword swallower steps through a metal detector and raises his hands in preemptive apology for the blade he\u2019s substituted for his spine. An acrobat climbs through a window and into a museum\u2019s upstairs bathroom looking for something that will fix the ache inside him, an elephant charges a train calling for its mate. Circuses dissolve. Carnivals collapse. Things get broken. We have always come here, when we\u2019re in the area. Every seventy-six years or so, we visit, and the place has always forgotten us by the time we come again, but that doesn\u2019t mean we have difficulty with our methods. We\u2019ve been doing this for centuries, and we\u2019re skilled. At the end of the summer, here in this town at the edge of the woods, there\u2019s a day on which broadsheets fly in the form of paper aeroplanes, landing on doorsteps, catching in trees. The townspeople open the flyers and consider the date of the show with some annoyance. Inside one flyer, there\u2019s an advertisement for a performance fifty years in the future. In the next, a performance fifty years in the past. See the Unseeable, all the flyers read, and the townspeople grumble at the litter. The next batch are printed Know the Unknowable. No one on Earth wants to know the unknowable anymore. There are plenty of things to know already. The world is too full and brains can only hold so much. Headlines flash across foreheads. Sometimes the guilt of information is too much to bear, and people hide inside their houses, burrowing under the covers, trying not to listen to the news. Whole countries are dying out there. The sky is falling. Some of the birds have stopped singing, and no one knows whether that\u2019s been true for years, or has only just happened. There is too much noise, and it\u2019s hard to tell who hasn\u2019t been heard from in a while. There is an ailment moving from continent to continent, these days, and its symptoms include spontaneous deafness and blindness, and finally, in its last stages, spontaneous and permanent silence, without even any satisfying last words. A person might ask for a refill of coffee, and that will be all. Some people try to expose themselves to the disease. The quiet calls to them. In this town, no one has the disease yet, for which we are grateful. Everyone can hear the flyers flying. Occasionally, one of them makes a trill, and townspeople look up, frustrated, snatch the flyer from the air, and stomp on it, feeling assaulted by whimsy, or possibly spied upon by their government. On each broadsheet there\u2019s a simple drawing: a large black box in the center of a circle of trees. Maybe it isn\u2019t a box. Maybe it\u2019s a door. And maybe there is something, far off in the blackness inside it, something. But maybe not. Probably not. It\u2019s a blotchy drawing, and unsatisfying. It seems to have been done by a child, not by any real artist. Fingerpaints on paper. Each one is hand drawn, not printed. Whoever did them doesn\u2019t know much about much. Nothing\u2019s made of paper now. There are better things to write on. Paper melts in rain. Paper turns to ragged slushy nothing. Even folded paper animals eventually disintegrate. But we like them. Old-fashioned paper ticket stubs pour down one afternoon in a swift yellow storm. The Show Happened Before You Were Born, they are printed, and on the other side, The Show Will Start After You Are Dead. It isn\u2019t the children who pick them up. The children are busy, and things like this are beneath them. The town\u2019s janitor uses a snowplow to gather the drifts and then to pile them at the edge of town. He sets them on fire with a single quick breath. Then he sits down in some satisfaction, and roasts a hotdog. Nothing has come to the town that hasn\u2019t always been there. This isn\u2019t new. The janitor has seen weather like this before. It always passes, and if it doesn\u2019t pass, there\u2019s the end of the world to consider. He has a menagerie of tin cans, and plenty of ammunition. He has some hounds. One day, he suspects he\u2019ll need them, but he\u2019s lived in proximity to the possible end for long enough that he\u2019s used to it. If it gets him, it does. Everyone dies. He keeps things clean, and that\u2019s his job. Clean doesn\u2019t always mean things are safe. There might be lights on every corner, and there will still be shadows. There\u2019s nothing the janitor can do about that, save setting the town on fire, and even then, light only lasts so long. He\u2019s only one person here, cleaning up at the edge of the woods, and he works from nine at night till five in the morning. He\u2019d been doing this job for centuries, in this part of the country, which is a notorious part of the country. Everybody knows it is. People live here anyway. There is, as it happens, one stranger in town. The woman moved here recently, from a much larger city. She isn\u2019t officially a resident, though she\u2019s rented a tiny house near the place where the forest starts. She owns a grey cat named Susurrus, remnant of a relationship, and a small roll of money that won\u2019t take her far. She left her last place in the middle of the night, as the ambulances were coming, and there was no time to pack up more than the cat, who prowls now, joyful but for his bell, stalking the edge of the woods where the songbirds don\u2019t sing. The woman has used up the name she had before, and now she doesn\u2019t have one. She opens the flyer stuck in her screen door, and finds her old name written across it in a filthy blot, as though by a thumb pressed in ink. She crumples up the paper, tears it into tiny pieces, and then buries it in the back garden, but two hours later, she feels the need to dig it up and put it in the oven on broil, until it\u2019s ashes. She realises only after she\u2019s burnt the broadsheet that she has looked at the drawing underneath her name. When she shuts her eyes that night, she can see the dark, smudgy rectangle at the center of the trees, and she can see something inside it, far off in the black, something moving. The date on her flyer, the only one like this, is neither in the past nor in the future. She opens her eyes and pours herself a drink. It\u2019s four in the morning. She pours herself another. It isn\u2019t as though she\u2019s going to this performance. She\u2019ll get drunk instead, and maybe drinking will put her to sleep. Outside the window, she can see that it\u2019s started to snow. It\u2019s summer, not winter. At last, she goes out in her underwear and discovers that the snow isn\u2019t snow, but popcorn. She picks up a kernel. It\u2019s cold and flat, muddied. Whoever made it doesn\u2019t know much about popcorn. That, or it\u2019s been falling a long time. She hears a machine start up, and a moment later, the janitor drives by, pushing the popcorn ahead of him, a rolling wave, a dry tsunami. \u201cStrange weather,\u201d she ventures, calling out to him from her steps, but if he hears her, he doesn\u2019t have a reply. Maybe it isn\u2019t strange at all. She doesn\u2019t know. She\u2019s new to town. She can\u2019t tell how people speak to one another here. He hasn\u2019t even looked at her, and here she is, standing outdoors, the better part of naked. For the past week, since she arrived on foot from the bus station, she\u2019s been either naked in her house, or wearing the same thing: a pair of torn up jeans that don\u2019t belong to her, picked up from the floor of the last place, and a t-shirt covered in black and red blotches like some kind of accidental Rorschach. In her old life, she would never have gone outside like this, but this is her new life. She puts on the jeans and t-shirt, scrapes her hair up into a ponytail and goes out barefoot into the drifts of popcorn. There are ashes smeared on her face from the burning of the flyer, but she doesn\u2019t care about that either. She takes the bottle with her. She can hear her cat\u2019s bell and so she walks toward that, into the trees, where the storm abruptly stops. Now it\u2019s dark and all there is to hear is the sound of the bell cheerfully jingling. Sometimes she wants to give up and let Susurrus catch birds, just to see if they sing as he kills them, if what she hears as singing are actually birds screaming. She wonders if their lack of song is a choice, if they, too, are tired of the noise. She wonders if birds ever get tired of Earth. Her feet on the ground feel suddenly like the cat\u2019s paws, and she looks down, strangely certain, expecting to be startled by something unholy. No. She\u2019s half drunk, is all, and sleep deprived. There isn\u2019t enough sleep lately. She\u2019s due a rest. She\u2019s here to sleep, and to dream, and to forget, and to be forgotten about. Faint hope, but it\u2019s a place near the woods, and that\u2019s been her plan. Screen door and little porch. She hasn\u2019t even been into the trees yet. Somehow everything else takes up her time. She\u2019s scrubbed the house three times already, trying to wash away the blood that isn\u2019t there, and never has been. On her knees, she realised what she was doing, and she was bewildered. Her mind had been telling her a story about something that had never happened here. She stood up, yes, and put the scrubbing brush back into the bucket, bucket into the closet, closet locked. All the closets have locks, each one with a key of its own. She has all the keys. She\u2019s counted and tested them. There are no extra keys on the ring. The house is tiny, but she has eleven keys, enough that she can wear the ring as a bracelet. She has it on now as she walks deeper into the woods, and the little skeletons are cold against her wrist. The bell isn\u2019t as close as it was, and she isn\u2019t really looking for the cat anyway. She leans against a tree and drinks from the bottle. She feels bad about the way she used her old name. It\u2019s wrung out. She doesn\u2019t want it back, even as she\u2019s sorry for it. It belonged to a nicer person, a quiet person, a person who missed things when she looked at other people. Then, suddenly, her name was everywhere, out of control, surging up in front of her as she drove, flashing across the bottoms of screens. Someone calling her by name from out of the car radio, telling her to turn herself in. Turn yourself inside out, she thought, in a fucked up singsong. Things had happened, and she\u2019d lived through them. For the past week, she\u2019s taken to calling herself a less used name, the one that belonged to her sister before her sister died, falling into a well while in the process of poisoning someone\u2019s water. The motives of the dead are often unclear. Wren floated up with the fingers of one hand shoved through the handle of a jug of drain cleaner. Whatever mistake she made to cause herself to fall, the poison was on purpose. The neighbours died, and so did Wren, but Wren was born to die in the dark. It was a miracle she\u2019d made it so long. The second Wren, though, has thus far been a good enough person. A week in, and all she\u2019s done wrong is steal a can of tomatoes from the store. She considers her credentials. Starting over shortens the list of sins. She\u2019s innocent all over again, of crimes, of sorrows, of history, of stupidity. The t-shirt feels stiff where the blotches are. She needs to steal something reasonable to wear. The only other thing she has is a short green dress, not appropriate for anything but the middle of the night and a dance floor. She found it in her purse along with her high heels, leftovers from the last night of her past, sprinting naked from the house, grabbing clothes from the floor as she went. Sometimes she hates Earth. She walks deeper into the dark, the jingling far away still. She feels an object touch her face, and she slaps it away. A bat or bird. It swings back, though, and hits her again, and this time, she sees that it isn\u2019t alive. It\u2019s a paper animal on a string. A bear. She brings it close to her face and looks at it. Nothing to be afraid of. A tiny cut-out grizzly, rearing up on its haunches, hanging from a string. There\u2019s a dim light here, in this clearing, and she can see other paper creatures, with light bulbs strung between them. The clearing is large. She can see the lights on the other side, but only barely. She can tell there\u2019s a breeze by the way the lights bounce. There\u2019s a paper lion, and an elephant made of newsprint striped with old headlines. How long has this been here? The animals are the worse for the wear. She follows the barbed wire around the outer edge, touching each animal in turn. Some of them she doesn\u2019t recognise. There\u2019s a horse with the body of a snake, and a couple of the animals are nothing more than crumpled balls of pointed folds, carefully done, but nothing she\u2019s seen before. There\u2019s something made of an old photograph, folded and sliced into long arms, many of them, and jaws. She can\u2019t quite see what the photograph was, but it seems to be a family portrait, the kind you\u2019d get taken at a shopping mall. There are grins in it, and the unmistakable alligator emblem of a polo shirt. The string of lights shakes as Wren ducks under it, not thinking about it. She\u2019s always ducked under fences. Her childhood was rural. There\u2019s nothing here, no beehives, no barbed wire to keep the bears out. She still has her bottle. She has another drink. The cat mews from somewhere quite close, and she looks around. \u201cCome on,\u201d she says. \u201cCome here,\u201d but the cat refuses. It\u2019s on the other side of the wire. She can see the animals moving where the cat bats at them. There\u2019s a strange noise, then, and a bright light goes on, from somewhere high above her. A helicopter, and here she is, in the open. This is a mistake made by her old self. The first Wren would never have made this kind of error. There\u2019s no place on Earth a person can be invisible forever, not anymore. Maybe there never has been. It\u2019s only been a week, but a week is long enough for her face to be everywhere, projected onto buildings, blinking on in the middle of phone calls. She crouches lower to the ground, her knees nearly touching the mud, and keeps her head down. She closes her eyes, wondering if it will be guns or ropes. She clenches the bottle in her hand in case they come down beside her and she has a chance. There is no chance with a chance like that. At least she\u2019ll fight. But there are no sounds of helicopter blades. There are no sounds at all, beyond those of the cat hitting the paper animals with his paws and chirruping when they return to him. There is a feeling. A vibration, a hum, a whirr, and she opens her eyes, blinded by the light around her. Light and movement. Something\u2019s spinning and she\u2019s at the center of it. Something\u2019s rising and she\u2019s part of it. The cat hisses and spits outside the circle of light, and Wren lurches to her feet, feeling the sky shifting above her. She hears a clicking, looks up and sees dark things against the brightness, but that is all. There\u2019s nothing certain up there, nothing but sparks and flickers. The clearing is entirely bathed in white, but outside it, there\u2019s night on all sides. She spins slowly, trying to see, but there\u2019s nothing to be seen. We are the ones above her. We know better than to be visible, not at this point. There\u2019s a huffing sound, and a shrill whirring, metallic. There\u2019s a sound like something stretching, another like the pages of an encyclopedia being ruffled. There\u2019s a sound like something landing from a height, and trying to be quiet. There\u2019s a sound like something cracking. Wren wonders if she\u2019s the one cracking. She clutches the bottle more tightly. If she could leave the center of the light, she could break the bottle\u2019s neck, and then it could be used, but she can\u2019t move. There\u2019s something about the edge of the spotlight. It\u2019s not a clean circle any longer. There are things out there. Wren can see shadows, cast inward toward her. Spiny shadows, antlers, horns, fur. Tails. Something lashing and coiled. She hears her cat again, yowling, and she clucks for him to come to her. Susurrus bolts out of the dark, running, fur on end, ears flattened. The shadows move nearer. One of them leaps over another. Something rears up on its hind legs, and another something rolls and begins to unfold. The shadows are growing larger. We have our ways of testing, our ways of seeing if someone is ready. The circle is smaller now. There are things coming closer to her. The cat hoops its back and howls, and Wren catches the faint echo of tinny piano. She can smell burning popcorn. She can hear a crowd, but the crowd isn\u2019t even whispering. They\u2019re just breathing in, breathing out as something tumbles down to her, shining, twisting, a metal bar suspended on thin chains. In the space between the chains, in the rectangle outlined by the bar and the links, is darkness. She tries to look through it, to the other side of the circle, but there\u2019s nothing. Now it\u2019s on the ground just before her, the bar nearly under her bare toes. She can hear the string of lights creaking. She can hear something growling. Oh, she is tired of Earth. Oh, she is tired of the things outside the light, the way they are always circling. This has not been an easy ever after, not since the beginning, and not since last week. Her life has always been larger in the rearview than it appears. There have always been terrible things in the blind spots. When she turns her head, she sees eyes, flashing in the dark, but nothing else. There\u2019s a heavy sigh from the silence. Somewhere far away, there\u2019s a brass band, but it sounds like music from a television set, wrong slightly, missing notes. Her cat is wrapped around her ankles, tightly curled, hissing. She shivers, and laces her fingers through the chains to steady herself. She can smell her own skin now, the blood on her shirt, the way her hair reeks of cigarettes, and she can smell pipe smoke, too, and something brighter and stranger. A shadow stretches from the edge of the remaining light, extending itself elegantly over her foot. Susurrus spits and claws and the shadow stretches again, extending its paw, unfurling, until it moves away from the edge of the circle entirely, and arrives before her, a bulk, a shape made of silhouette. She can feel the crowd waiting. The air hums with a collective intake of breath as she kneels down before the shadow. We rejoice. She is the one we\u2019ve been calling to. She\u2019s the one we dropped the fliers to find. It opens its jaws, and she looks into its mouth. There\u2019s nothing there, nothing but her head in the teeth of a shadow, but all around the clearing the trees quiver, and for a moment, she feels the invisible crowd, applauding her bravery. The shadow shakes itself and then leaps through the chains, into the dark suspended above the trapeze. The cat purrs in greeting and follows it, and Wren jolts forward, shocked, reaching. She can\u2019t see him anymore. His grey shape is gone, like that, not falling, but gone completely. There\u2019s a strip of black stretching up from her toes, and into the sky, and she stands on the edge of it and stares into it. Something is there, but it isn\u2019t the cat. Something pale, a disc or orb. It\u2019s far away. She can\u2019t tell what it is, nor how it moves, but it is better than anything she has found here. She blinks, and it\u2019s gone, then returned, then gone again. It is glad. It is entertained. Wren can feel the invisible crowd leaning in, watching her. There\u2019s a gasp, an intake, an unbreath, as she puts one foot onto the bar. The ring of keys on her wrist rattles against the metal links suspending the dark. She can feel their cold lips. Little skeletons, married to locks that have nothing to guard. She thinks of her sister falling face first into oblivion, poison in her hands, ruined by one mistake piled onto too many others. She thinks of the first Wren as the trapeze begins to rise. The first Wren started wrong and got worse. The second Wren is better than the first. She\u2019s sure she must be. She will keep going. Things have happened, but things happen to everyone. This isn\u2019t how she planned to run away, running up instead of out. This was not what she\u2019d imagined. She is running away to join something. She is running away from the ground. The trapeze begins to rise, suspended from the night. The town, now, is visible below her, like something carved out of salt, the buildings covered in pale drifts of popcorn and ticket stubs, our circus flyers in the wind, drifting down like provisions over a warzone. The piano\u2019s faint, playing from the trees and the earth, from the mud, and the shadow animals circle the clearing, doing their tricks in darkness. The second Wren stretches her toes on the trapeze, and extends a foot into the air. She arches her spine and leans back, looking at the Earth from upside down. She can see the snow plow driven by the janitor, pushing another load of ticket stubs out of the streets and into the fire. She\u2019s not frightened, no, not anymore, though she\u2019s spent her life feeling frightened. She is glad. She is entertained. Wren clasps the chains hard in her hands, and dangles in the splits, upside down under the sky. She points her toes, and the trapeze spins as she dances in space, a woman hanging in thin air. We know that everyone loves a circus. The smell of the greasepaint, we know the recipe. The rolls of tickets, printed in a small machine we purchased at auction. The two-headed goatgirl and the tattooed lady, the fire swallower, all persons we found lost and bewildered, persons looking up. Persons who\u2019d grown exhausted of Earth. We know that no one can resist popcorn, and so we pop it here. They used to come from miles around, baited by the show, tickets clutched in grubby fists. Families, and single men looking for the carnival strippers. Women used to arrive in groups, holding hands in the dark, fearful, but ready. Grandfathers with their grandchildren. There are fewer now than there were. We are not a stranger coming to town. We were up here before the town was here. The second Wren is on the trapeze, her clothing turns to a tutu and a glittering cape. All around her are hoops and balls made of fire, and through them the shadows put on a show. We\u2019ve been bringing new performers into our circus for a century. Sometimes one doesn\u2019t work out. We lower the trapeze and leave those on the ground, in the center of a clearing that once glowed white with our tent lights. Sometimes they stagger back to town, trying to tell the rest of the people about what they saw when they went into the sky. \u201cDid you die?\u201d people ask them, and they say they did, or that they saw something they can\u2019t explain. It doesn\u2019t matter which. Dying and returning to life never make most people believe in anything more than their own private glories. One can drop into a well or rise into the light. It\u2019s always the same, we make sure of that. White glow, a tunnel, a levitation. The sound of our piano and our popcorn machine, the barkers around the edge of the world. We bring performers up, and we treat them well, better than they\u2019d be treated on the ground. All of them are on the run from something. All of them are lost and lonely. On the trapeze, Wren remembers everything that\u2019s ever happened, a shining rush of colour and touch, warbling birds and dishwashers. A whisper of someone in a movie theatre, the sound of an arrow leaving a bow and piercing an apple, a balloon popping. Susurrus leaps out of the dark as she rises, into her arms, and the cat \u2014 -we have always enjoyed cats \u2014 -comes with our new performer, into the hold of our ship. We\u2019re not looking for the things people think we are. We\u2019re searching for echoes, for light that has travelled a century, the pale ripplings of Charlie Chaplin, bouncing out and up to us, the songs we heard when we were tiny things travelling between far-flung destinations. We are looking for wonders, just as everyone else is looking for wonders. We are looking for the glory of flight. On the trapeze, the girl and her cat spin, and as we watch, she glitters, she shines, she is our winged wonder, she is our newest act. See the Unseeable, Wren whispers as she spins, Know the Unknowable. She swings on the trapeze, and we see the wings we knew were always there. We watch the wonder of her running away to join us, and far below her, far below our vantage of bleachers and sawdust, of striped tent \u2014 -we can make anything we wish seem true \u2014 -we can see the janitor looking up. He points at us as he drives the snowplow, pushing a mile of popcorn, and behind him our animals gallop, a string of horses with feathered headdresses, an elephant made of mist, a visitation from something that exists at the edge of the light. As the janitor watches, pointing up for no one but himself, though perhaps there are others from this town watching this, too, the girl in our spotlight rises, and rises, a spinning performer in a tutu, hanging from nothing. At last, she disappears. Out of the gloom and into the dazzle, into the sawdust ring with her tremendous cat and her bare feet, with the air full of flowers as she takes her bow. The janitor doesn\u2019t see that part. The town doesn\u2019t see it. But all over the woods, the ticket stubs blaze for a moment for all the people we\u2019ve taken up. Then we\u2019re gone, a comet, a wonder, a hoax, and the piano fades and the brass band quiets, and our animals run trumpeting and nickering, roaring and singing, all in their formations, dancing across the dark face of the Earth. \u000aABOUT THE AUTHOR Maria Dahvana Headley is the author of the young adult sky ship fantasy Magonia, from HarperCollins; the novel Queen of Kings; the internationally bestselling memoir The Year of Yes; and The End of the Sentence, a novella co-written with Kat Howard, from Subterranean.

V  How does one read a book without opening it? Why would you want to read a closed book in the first place? While not a common problem, it\u2019s enough of one that MIT research scientist Barmak Heshmet decided to have a crack and came up with a system that uses terahertz radiation, femto-photography and air to read characters from a closed book, along with an algorithm that can give CAPTCHAs a run for their money.  But first, why closed books? Seems like a lot of trouble to go to when you could just, you know, open the book. Unfortunately, a lot of old and delicate tomes exist in libraries and vaults that would not survive the opening process, let alone exposure outside of controlled environments.  As Heshmet explains, their technique had to overcome a number of challenges: In order to read through a closed book you have to do four things: first, you have to have radiation that goes through the paper. So the paper has to be slightly transparent in this frequency range. Second, you have to have the time resolution to distinguish between different pages \u2026 Third, you have to have the spectral information of different inks \u2014 for example, the ink should be visible on that range of frequencies. And the fourth one is recognising the characters themselves. Terahertz radiation solved the first problem, as \u201cdifferent chemicals absorb different frequencies\u201d of the radiation, according to MIT\u2019s press release. So the composition of the ink would differ from the page it is on. Femto-photography handled the second requirement and the third was a matter of finding the relevant data and having it on hand. As for the last one, the research team came up with their own character recognition algorithms. Because they had to deal with images that would be heavily distorted and noisy, they ended up with something that would interest many a spammer: \u201cIt\u2019s actually kind of scary,\u201d Heshmat says of the letter-interpretation algorithm. \u201cA lot of websites have these letter certifications [captchas] to make sure you\u2019re not a robot, and this algorithm can get through a lot of them.\u201d The end result is a system that can distinguish 20 individual pages, however, the radiation isn\u2019t strong enough to read deeper than nine or so. The release mentions that advances in the associated technologies should improve these numbers, but for now, it\u2019s a neat achievement. [MIT, via TechCrunch]

VAfter years of working from coffee shops and couches, there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m certain of: working remotely is hard. Incredibly hard. On paper, it sounds all rainbows and unicorns \u2014 you get to choose your own hours, you don\u2019t need to deal with a boss looming over your shoulder, and you can even work in your pajamas.\u000a Image by Caroline Tomlinson via Getty. This post originally appeared on the Zapier blog. But working from home can just as easily be defined by poor productivity, low energy, and the slippery slope of procrastination. You spend half your time battling distractions, and the other half fighting off the guilt that comes from giving in to those distractions. How can you work from home while keeping your focus? I\u2019ve been working remotely for more than nine years, collecting productivity tactics along with my friend Dan Shure. These tricks keep us productive, regardless of where we\u2019re working. How you start your day often determines how you end it. If you check Facebook immediately after you wake up, there\u2019s a good chance that behaviour will carry over to the rest of your day. Turns out there\u2019s some research to back this up: your energy and willpower peak in the morning. Throughout the day, your willpower is diminished, which means you\u2019re more susceptible to distractions. That three-hour Netflix binge sounds a lot more appealing when you\u2019ve already been slacking off since the morning. Besides the usual \u2014 like exercise, diet, and meditation \u2014 there are four habits I\u2019ve developed that help me start my days right. Hemingway wrote every morning. Richard Branson is up and about no later than 5:45 AM \u2014 even on his private island. You\u2019ll find that rising before the sun is a habit shared by most successful people. This makes sense from a productivity standpoint: You have willpower and fewer distractions early in the morning. By tackling your to-do list as soon as you wake up, you\u2019ll avoid the desperate last minute rush to get things done. Plus, according to one study, waking up early can also make you happier. Before I do anything else in the morning, I make my bed. That\u2019s advice I picked up from William McRaven, a former US Navy Admiral and the 9th Commander of USSOCOM. Here\u2019s what he says about making your bed after waking up: \u000a\u201cIf you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride. And it will encourage you to do another task. By the end of the day, that one task will reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter\u2026and if you can\u2019t do the little things right, you\u2019ll never do the big things right.\u201d\u000a This is something productivity guru Tim Ferriss swears by, too \u2014 making your bed after you wake up gives you a sense of accomplishment and crosses at least one task from your to-do list. Plus, no matter what the day throws at you, it\u2019s one thing you can control. I find that it also keeps me from checking my phone in bed \u2014 a massive productivity killer. This might sound mundane, but drinking enough water can have a pretty big impact on productivity. 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated \u2014 they don\u2019t get the recommended intake of around 3.2L of water. That\u2019s bad for your health, and also bad for your productivity since: Drinking a glass of water right after waking up takes care of two problems \u2014 it kickstarts your metabolism and helps you meet the goal of 3.2L of water. It\u2019s a simple solution to a big problem. \u201cThe most effective practice lies in the preparation,\u201d says Stephen Nachmanovitch in Free Play. He was talking about practicing art and music, but it also applies to work. Essentially, by setting up your environment prior to starting your workday, you can jump right into your most important tasks, without worrying about meaningless details that detract from your mental gas tank. So clear your desk of distractions \u2014 even washing its surface will make you more productive. Try to plan out your to-dos the night before. And prep your lunch and snacks for the day ahead of time, so you can fuel your body without wasting effort on decision-making. Also, clear as much of your email inbox as possible the night before. This way, even if you\u2019re tempted to open email or need to check something in your inbox, you\u2019re not derailed by new messages. I spend most of my days working from my home office. But sometimes, I head over to a coffee shop or local co-working space to change my work environment. Contrary to popular belief, a bit of ambient noise \u2014 the soft chatter inside a coffee shop, for example \u2014 can actually increase productivity. In one study published in the Journal of Consumer Research, light noise (at around 70db) was found to improve focus more than silence (at around 50db). Then there\u2019s the famous Hawthorne Effect, where people improve their behaviour when they are being observed. That means you\u2019ll be less liable to slack off on Reddit if others are watching \u2014 one reason why people working from co-working places report a 6-7 point improvement in productivity. However, not all environment changes have to be as drastic. Even something small as moving from a sitting desk to a standing desk can give you an immediate boost in productivity. Willpower is a quintessentially human trait, but most of us don\u2019t really understand it. Research shows that willpower, like energy, is a finite resource. Metaphorically, you start every day with a limited quantity of \u201cwillpower points.\u201d As you move through the day \u2014 making (and putting off) decisions \u2014 you spend those points. Once you\u2019re depleted, you\u2019re prone to temptations and distractions. The key to productivity is to manage these \u201cwillpower points\u201d so you have more energy for making hard decisions (and ignoring distractions). Here are a two things that work for both me and Dan: Every time you fight off a temptation, you spend some willpower points. Actively resisting the urge to eat a doughnut is harder than not having the doughnut at all. I call this \u201cchoosing the path of least resistance.\u201d Instead of fighting off temptations, you remove them from your surroundings altogether. No temptations, no willpower wasted. If you\u2019re trying to lose weight, you wouldn\u2019t stuff your freezer with ice cream. You\u2019d tame your urges by eliminating your access to them. Similarly, if you\u2019re trying to avoid social media, blocking the sites altogether will conserve more willpower than actively avoiding the urge to open Facebook in a new tab. When I walk into my office every morning, I have three things already setup for me: This way, I don\u2019t have to dawdle around while I wait for the laptop to load, or figure out what tasks to tackle for the day. By designing my work environment this way, I hit the ground running instead of fighting off distractions. This conserves willpower and ensures I don\u2019t lose momentum. When you\u2019re working from home, it\u2019s easy to curl up in bed with a laptop and pretend that you\u2019re \u201cworking.\u201d I should know \u2014 I did that for years. I had my biggest productivity gains when I started treating my work and personal areas as separate spaces. I used my bedroom just for sleeping, the living room for entertaining friends, and built a separate home office just for work. This helps set the frame for improved productivity. When you enter your home office, you don\u2019t expect to take a nap or watch TV. Your brain gets spatially wired to think of the office as the place where work happens. You get bonus points if you dress up in office attire (or at least something more formal than PJs) when you\u2019re working at home. Plus, the separation creates a mini \u201ccommute.\u201d Simply walking from the bedroom to the office signals that you\u2019re physically moving between work and personal space. Your brain automatically switches into productivity mode when it starts seeing the work area as a place to get things done. Every productive person I know has their own \u201crecipe\u201d of productivity tools. Some of them keep it sparse, using a couple of tools at most. Others use complicated combos to keep track of everything. Here are the tools I use for keeping my productivity up: You\u2019ll need your own set of apps to stay focused and productive. Check out Zapier\u2019s app roundups and reviews to find the best software, and make sure your toolkit keeps you productive. If a tool isn\u2019t getting the job done, it\u2019s time to switch to another app. The pages of the web\u2019s most popular blogs are packed with \u201cgame-changing\u201d productivity techniques. Here are a few methods I\u2019ve tried: But here\u2019s the problem: These techniques rarely work for everyone. The popular Pomodoro Technique, for example, requires you to break a 5-minute break after every 25 minutes of work. This sounds great if you\u2019re working on a manager\u2019s schedule, with your day broken into hour-long blocks. However, if you\u2019re writing, coding or doing anything creative (i.e. following a \u201cmaker\u2019s schedule\u201d), two breaks every 50 minutes is two breaks too many. Instead of forcing one method to fit your work style, try A/B testing different time management techniques on yourself. That way, you\u2019re not flying blind, and you can zero in on your perfect system for personal productivity. With this approach, you\u2019d try out technique A on Day 1 and technique B on Day 2. Track your mood and productivity over a couple of weeks and you\u2019ll get a fair idea of which technique works better for you. There\u2019s a simple maxim in management science: what can be measured, can be improved. This applies to productivity as well. If you track how many hours you\u2019ve worked, your mood, and your number of tasks completed, you can spot weaknesses and improve your performance. Once you have data, you can even up the ante by gamifying productivity \u2014 say, rewarding yourself with a favourite treat if you exceed 8 hours of work for 5 days in a row. You could track your productivity with an app like RescueTime, but I prefer an old fashioned method. I create a spreadsheet for each month and track the number of hours I worked each day, using a time tracking app like Toggl to tally the minutes. You can connect it to Google Sheets with a Zapier integration to automatically log each day\u2019s time. To push myself further, I create a create a lower and upper limit (in daily hours). Dipping below the lower limit invites a penalty. Going over the upper limit gets me a reward. I then create a chart for the month so I know whether my productivity is going up or down. Here\u2019s what your spreadsheet might look like: And here\u2019s the accompanying chart I add, to view my productivity at a glance: At a glance, I can see if I\u2019m doing well, when I\u2019m slacking off, and how many hours I\u2019m working every day/week/month on average. Most of these tactics require making a new habit \u2014 the holy grail of productivity. So, how long will that take? Phillippa Lally is a health psychology researcher at University College London. Lally and her research team published a study in the European Journal of Social Psychology where they tried to figure out how long it really takes to form a habit. After examining 96 people for 12 weeks, they concluded it takes 2 months on average before a new behaviour becomes automatic \u2014 66 days to be precise. I\u2019m not going to tell you that\u2019s a hard-and-fast rule \u2014 you won\u2019t magically enter habit-mode after 66 days. But it\u2019s a good benchmark to shoot for. One way to measure your progress is by using the X-card technique. (Some people call this the \u201cSeinfeld Technique,\u201d named after comedian Jerry Seinfeld who committed to working every day to hone his craft, without breaking the chain.) The technique is simple enough: start by creating an \u201cX-Card,\u201d an index card divided into a 7×7 grid of 49 boxes. You could also use a dedicated app like 7 weeks or a good old-fashioned calendar. On top of each card, write the habit you want to stick with. Every time you stick to that habit, you mark it with a big X in one of the boxes. For example, if you decide to go to bed every day before midnight, your X-card will look like this: Every day before you go to bed, cross the boxes one by one. But here\u2019s the catch: you need to keep the streak alive. Building a habit means taking the same action every single day. Whenever you need a little extra motivation, remind yourself that missing an X means your streak is busted, and you\u2019ll need to start from square one. How you choose to face that challenge won\u2019t just determine your productivity \u2014 it will determine your future success and even your happiness. If you adapt these tips to your life, you just might find that your time off the clock is more productive, too.

VInbox by Gmail has been around for almost two years, and while it continues to exist alongside Gmail, it\u2019s easy to see that Google engineers see Inbox as the email app of the future. New features are being added on a regular basis, and with each one, it\u2019s slowly becoming smarter and easier to use. Here are five reasons you should consider switching to Inbox right now.\u000a Recently added features bring Trello and GitHub integration to Inbox, which it can parse information inside messages sent from those services and give you automatic alerts rather than a standard \u2018new email\u2019 update. It works in the same way that Inbox scans hotel bookings for key details. It works with things like Google Alerts and Google Drive too, so you can finally insert Drive links directly into emails and skip the step of adding the file as an attachment. The list of supported services is fairly sparse right now, but it\u2019s easy to see how Google could expand type of integration, making more of your email updates smart, so you get the key information at a glance. Email newsletters are back in fashion (we have one) and Inbox deals with them in a clever way, parsing the links inside to give you a quick summary. You can tap on one or more of the links or just ignore them completely. You can still open the whole newsletter if you want more information, but this is another prime example of Inbox making it easier to get through lots of email. Once you\u2019re done with a particular newsletter, it\u2019s minimized in the email list to take up less space. As with anything else in the Inbox app, you can swipe on a newsletter to archive or snooze it. One key feature Inbox has that Gmail doesn\u2019t is smart replies. Quick, AI-powered responses to your contacts to help you power through your inbox and spend less time composing replies. Open up any thread you\u2019re planning to respond to, and you\u2019ll see the generated quick replies appear in blue boxes at the foot of the screen. Google engineers recently added emoji to the list of possible replies too. You still have the option to reply like a normal human being if you want, and the feature is now available on the web as well as mobile. You can use Gmail as a read-it-later service and to do list, but Inbox is geared up more specifically for these type oftasks. Online articles can be saved to Inbox on Android or iOS, provided Inbox is installed, and on the web through an official Chrome extension. Meanwhile the ability to add reminders is right next to the option to compose a new email (use the large red plus icon on mobile or the web). To dos can be associated with a time and even a place. The reminders sync neatly to Google Now too, so you can access them without having to go into Inbox each time. The ability to snooze emails isn\u2019t available in Gmail, and the option in Inbox has been getting more and more advanced over time. If the app detects a date and time in the email you\u2019re snoozing, for example, that comes up as a snooze suggestion. It works for package tracking, hotel and flight reservations, invites from Google Calendar and more, letting you forget about an email until you really need it. What\u2019s more, you can customise snooze times and days for morning, afternoon and evening through the app settings. I ran with it for a while, but went back to the old gmail - there was something that bugged me about it. I use Inbox full time, and going back to Gmail is like going back to Windows 95. That being said, Inbox's (just like Gmail's) threading of conversations is a hot mess. Sure, I've gotten used to it, but when your want to, or other people have replied out of sync with the main thread, the whole thing is completely unusable. The ability to send links to Inbox is great, and the Material-Design theme is hugely pleasing on the eyes; which, having been around for 2 years, makes you wonder why Calendar is still stuck in the last decade. On the mobile it's great, but swipes should be able to be configured out of Snooze, Done or Delete, not just Snooze and Done or Delete. I hardly ever hit snooze, but it's almost always a case of delete or file away. If you haven't tried it yet, I encourage you to download Chrome on that old XP machine, forget about Hotmail in Internet Explorer 6 and give Inbox a go. I use Inbox full time, and going back to Gmail is like going back to Windows 95. Yup. That just about says it all. But how to describe/suggest it to those uncooperatives setup attached to the excesses of Gmail? \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 9:21 am								 I have tried inbox several times and it is missing 1 major feature:. The ability to apply labels as quickly as Gmail in a web browser.  I have hundreds of well organized labels and moving an email to a label is time consuming in inbox.  In Gmail, it's a few keystrokes because of the great search box.  Even the Gmail mobile app is terrible at labels. The search functionality is still useless, will find anything from years ago but nothing in the last few days. When it first came out it wasn't quite prime time ready but now it's great especially for mobile.\u000aOn computer I still use gmail more. You cant signup to a new account any time soon, doing upgrades I love Inbox\u2014it got my main account back to Inbox Zero for the first time in years\u2014but it's fair to say that it's pretty prescriptive about email management. Gmail is fantastic at giving you a bunch of tools for managing email, like labels, stars and archiving, but it doesn't really push you to use them in any particular way. Inbox uses those tools to build a fairly specific workflow, so if you find that you don't like that workflow, it might not be a great tool for you.

p554
VApple ditched the headphone jack in favour of just using the lightning port. So now, of course, there\u2019s a dongle to replace the headphone jack. Apple will include one with every new iPhone 7.\u000a Good ol\u2019 Timmy Cook over at Apple really had a chance to charge us, the common man and woman, and exorbitant amount of money for this simple dongle. Well, he didn\u2019t. It\u2019s $12. Some folks online speculated it might cost 25 or 40 bucks, which is the cost of multiple burgers. That\u2019s unacceptable. This only costs one burger. Thanks Tim! Sorry, but being charged $12 for a port that should be on the phone is a rip-off! I think you get one with the phone, so the $12 is the replacement cost.  As someone thats had multiple $300 headphones broken at that jack point, I dont mind the adapter myself.  It moves the stress point to it rather than the headphones, and its far easier on the wallet getting a $12 replacement than what some studio headphones cost. I'm not an apple fan, but I can see sense in this when theres already a jack there (the lightning jack) that also serves other purposes that can be used for the same purpose.  It might not be the drama people expect it to be. If its true there is no NFC, that might become a bigger drama over the next 12 months. Huh. Didn't think of it like that. But your right. You would probably more likely break the adapter than the headset cable.\u000aStill find it really annoying thought and have no inclination on upgrading my phone anytime soon now. Yeah, I think its annoying as well, and have approximately zero desire to get an iPhone (well, work gave me one, but it sits in a drawer), but as someone that seems to break a lot of headphones (from $10 disposables to $300 Bowers + Wilkins), and mostly at THAT specific point, moving the stress point is a good thing. Niece works in the music industry, so luckily for her gets them given to her, but she's also broken more than one set of studio quality headphones at that same point with simple accidents. I have an iPhone after having had various problems with all the android phones I had. My 6s has been pretty flawless so I think I will be in the apple ecosystem for a while.\u000aBut yeah I always had the same problem as you with breaking headphones. Couldn't get one to last longer than a year pretty much. A couple of years ago though I bought a good pair of noise cancelling ones for an overseas trip. To deal with the breaking issue I got ones that had a replaceable cable. :) Had to replace it once so far but at least that's still a lot cheaper than new headphones. My B+W had removable cables, you think I could find any?  It came with two cables, one snapped when I bumped (not that hard either) a sliding door that opened slowly, and the other snapped when the cable got caught on something. They were that good (seriously, the P3's were a great set, I recommend them to anyone) I'd have paid $50 for new cables, but not even their website could help me.  Just kept getting fobbed off to a third party, who were as helpful as a torch to a blind man. Thankfully, they were still under warranty, so I took em back to DJ's and they just refunded what I paid for them and the warranty - was a wear and tear warranty, and worth the cost at the time. Trying to replace them, the connector worry was enough to stop me buying another expensive set.  Which was a shame, there were some great sets I was willing to drop plenty on.  My criteria were they had to be good and stylish (and not Beats), and price was pretty much secondary to that. Yeah to be honest I had to do a bit of running around to get my cable as well but ended up ok (shout out to the people at Addicted To Audio for that they were awesome).\u000aI have PSB M4U2's. I would have thought B+W would have been a lot easier to find though considering the brand. That's pretty annoying.\u000aBut yeah totally get the "cable getting caught on something" issue. I get mine caught on the train a lot. Hahah love the not Beats.\u000aMan such a rip-off for what they are. I guess at leas you got your money back in the end but definitely not a great experience. Poop, a reply didnt post. Dont sell Beats short, they are the prime reason people are willing to spend hundreds on headphones now, rather than $10.  And style was the big reason why.  Its just a shame they were $200 headphones hiding behind a $400 price tag, but thats Monster for you. For me, I'm a poker player as a hobby.  Decent enough, I've played in the WSOP Main Event in Vegas, so can spend a lot of time on the tables when I play.  I like to listen to my music, so quality is a must.  But a lot of poker players are also posers, particularly with their headphones, so they need to look good around your neck or on your head as well.  Shallow, but true :) So when I wanted a set, I was sick of seeing Beats, or Aviators, or a couple of other models that were just everywhere.  They were that common, people wearing them stopped being trendy and became sheep.  Much like buying an iPhone because everyone else has one... The P3's avoided that, were quality, and most importantly, a brand nobody else was wearing (as I said, posers...).  As they have a lot of experience with speakers, I trusted them to sound great as well, and they did.  I had zero regrets with using them, from a day to day perspective, or on the poker tables trying to represent. so the stress point is now at the only point where you can charge your phone?! bad idea. I have $500 headphones and I can honestly say they are built a whole lot differently to low cost headphones. Hell I even have 2 cables because the manufacturer is aware cables break. I broke one, not from the port but from getting it jammed in a door. I've had them for 4 years now and the cable at the port is not  at all in danger of breaking. So no I do not see another piece of junk to lose as a consumer friendly choice. Fair enough.  My experience is different, with two different jacks on the same set of headphones both breaking at that point.  One was my fault to some degree, I wasnt really paying attention to what I was doing, and bumped into a door opening slower than it should, but the other was simply a cord getting snagged, and ripping out the connector and breaking it.  As they were ~$300 headphones, it hurt. Cheapo's always broke at that point from repeated bending, just from sitting in my pocket, as did another $200 set.  I dont abuse my headphones, they simply connected in a way that bent and broke after a while, and I couldnt find a decent set that didnt do that. So while your experience may be that you cant see the port breaking, I cant say the same.  For ME, moving the risky point from those expensive headphones to something cheaply replaceable might be a good thing. I'm not sure its worth it for other reasons (I also like to listen to music at work, while the phones usually plugged in and charging), but for ME its something. I also expect that after a couple of months people wont notice anyway.  Its just an extra 5cms or so to your existing headphones anyway, who's going to really notice? Thinking about the device, it's a rigid plastic object that sticks out of the phone allot more than a 3.5mm short audio extension. I wouldn't expect this to be comfortable at the least and it's another object to lose. For me price isn't an issue. So risk of losing the dongle and discomfort vs added benefit of wear and tear. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 9:18 am								 GET OVER IT! Why have that bit of cord in between the lightning and headphones ports?  Surely if it was just the plastic bit, it would be much stronger and not need to be replaced as often due to cord breakage! \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 9:22 am								 I've found the rigid nature of the port to be why headphones break.  For me, adding the adapter adds a little buffer so I dont break $300 headphones at that point.  I'd rather pick up something thats $12 than faff about repairing or replacing expensive headphones. No charging the phone when using a wired earpiece then! That's exactly what I was thinking.... who came up with this idea?  or they going to release a "dual port charge and headphone" adaptor you can buy for another $12 ? Hope they have something that will let people charge phones *and* listen to music through headphones... it will probably cost 50 dollars =p I've found that the Lightning port is a really problematic point of failure - on both devices I've had with one it's worked loose really quickly.  Trying to plug in a set of headphones (that get both used and jiggled about as much as headphones do) is going to end in tears before bedtime. And they're charging $45 for the Apple earpods?  How much is a real pair of Lightning earbuds going to cost?! Most evenings, my phone will be charging and I have headphones in at the same time. No I don't want to uses wireless headphones. You all must charge your phones a lot if, charging and listening is your main concern. Considering charging takes about 15 mins and lasts 24+ hours, surely it's not an issue.\u000aMaybe the next iPhone will have wireless charging, then you won't have to worry. im doing it right now, playing games & charging phone. try again I hate to add to all the negativity around this adapter but most of us have problems already with our Apple headphones breaking. How is adding a two new connections going to make that any easier? Surely it is just a way for Apple to make more money on their low end accessories. All this talk about dongles is making me feel nostalgic. Everyone, I think you have all forgotten about sound quality... Does that cheap adapter even have a decent DAC in it? I am terrified to try it, as my $700 Beyerdynamics could sound like a $10 earphone toy

VMarvel\u2019s latest hero-vs.-hero event began with the death of James \u201cRhodey\u201d Rhodes/War Machine during a battle against Thanos. But Tony Stark\u2019s life has been falling apart for a while, even before Civil War II started. This week, the genius inventor grapples with the loss of his comrade-in-armour.  Even besides the death of Rhodey, Tony Stark\u2019s had it rough lately. He almost died on an undercover mission in Japan and his long absence from the public stage and presumed death fuelled a barely averted coup d\u2019etat by angry board Stark International board members. The Inhumans have declared war on Stark because he kidnapped precognitive character Ulysses, destroying his corporate headquarters. His company\u2019s financials are in freefall. And Victor Von Doom keeps hanging around Stark and his scientist girlfriend Amara Perera. While Rhodey\u2019s death happened months ago in the real world, the Invincible Iron Man series has been moving at a very decompressed pace to lay the groundwork for the changes that we now know are coming. Invincible Iron Man #13 \u2014 written by Brian Bendis with art by MIke Deodato, Frank Martin, and Clayton Cowles \u2014 is the issue that sees all of the stress catch up with Tony. His reunion with Dr. Perera goes terribly\u2026 And he can\u2019t even pull it together enough to go to Rhodey\u2019s funeral. The cool exec with a heart of steel generally hasn\u2019t dealt well with stress throughout his publishing history and this issue shows how his relationship with Rhodey has helped him through darker times. This isn\u2019t the first time that Tony Stark has faced apocalyptic setbacks. But it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s lost on such a big scale. His absence from the post-Civil War II stage seems to indicate that Captain Marvel will be on the winning side of the pro- vs. anti-interventionist debate, even if it ruins her. These aggregate changes represent a big shift from the latter-day interpretation of the character, who rose to flagship status after the first Iron Man movie kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tony\u2019s been shown as an occasionally douchey yet well-intentioned billionaire superhero, whose money and charm were assets as important as his genius. When Tony\u2019s been broken before, Rhodey was there to help him put his life back together. Without his best friend, that\u2019s going to be a lot harder.

VWant to buy an iPhone 7? Yeah, us too. Here\u2019s how much it\u2019ll cost you in Australia, and when you can buy one of your very own. The Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both go up for pre-order on the company\u2019s Aussie website tomorrow \u2014 Friday September 9. You\u2019ll be able to place that order through Apple\u2019s online store.  The phone itself goes on sale in Australia on Friday September 16. That\u2019s only one week after pre-orders rather than the usual two, which is an interesting departure from form for Apple.  While you\u2019ll be able to order the phone through Australia\u2019s major telcos as well as from Apple itself, we don\u2019t have on-plan pricing just yet. But the phone, like in previous years, will launch through Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and Virgin Mobile on the same day as you\u2019ll be able to buy it from the Apple Store. Second up with plan pricing for the brand new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is Telstra. Telstra will offer the iPhone 7 from as little as $85 per month on its Small plan with 1GB of data, $550 of calls and unlimited messages. Optus has released its on-contract pricing for the brand new iPhone 7. Optus will offer the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus on a range of plans, starting from as little as $40 per month and a total cost of $68 per month including handset repayment. Vodafone is first out of the gates with its on-contract pricing for the brand new iPhone 7. Vodafone will offer the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus on a range of plans, starting from as little as $40 per month and a total cost of $76 per month including handset repayment. Rounding out the pack of the major four telcos\u2019 iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus plan pricing is Virgin, who will give you an iPhone 7 for as little as $62 a month on the company\u2019s $30 plan \u2014 making it the cheapest iPhone 7 plan available. The cheapest iPhone 7 that you\u2019ll be able to buy outright will be $1079, and the cheapest iPhone 7 Plus will be $1269. Those are the prices for the entry-level 32GB version of the phone, but there will also be 128GB and 256GB variants of both available.  The 128GB iPhone 7 will set you back $1229, while the 128GB iPhone 7 Plus is $1419. The 256GB iPhone 7 is $1379, and the most expensive phone you\u2019ll be able to buy, the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus, is $1569. Those are outright prices, obviously \u2014 the phone will seem a hell of a lot cheaper if you buy it with a monthly repayment option on a plan from a telco. \u2022 Amazon Just Blew The Lid Off The iPhone 7\u000a\u2022 Apple Just Accidentally Tweeted The Latest iPhone\u000a\u2022 Everything You Need To Know About The Apple Watch Series 2\u000a\u2022 Super Mario Is Coming To The iPhone\u000a\u2022 The Apple Watch Series 2 Is \u2018Swimproof\u2019\u000a\u2022 The iPhone 7 Is Here: Everything You Need To Know\u000a\u2022 How The New iPhone Camera Will Make Your Photos Better\u000a\u2022 Apple\u2019s AirPods Are The Tiny Wireless Earbuds Of The Future\u000a\u2022 Everything Apple Announced Today\u000a\u2022 Apple Is Finally (Slowly) Giving Up On 16GB Phones Will seem a lot cheaper on a plan? Only if you can't do maths, the price of the handset is completely added in to the plan costs these days when you compare it to month-to-month plans. That's like saying buying a couch on interest free finance will seem cheaper, only to morons. Yeah, but it'll seem cheaper -- that's what I said. For the same price, you're spreading the cost out over a couple of years, which is a lot more palatable to the average buyer. There's also the fact that (at least for telstra, on plan), you can upgrade your phone to a new model for about $250 - $300, all up. Seems like alright value to me. not at all, currently a 6s Plus on telstra is $119 for 3GB of data per month, for $40 you can get a sim only plan with 5GB, over 24 months you are paying $1896 for a $1400 phone and getting less data. This is only true if you pay full price, I have other services with Telstra and because I'm on a $100 plan they give me $20 off. I can't get this with a SIM only plan. So I pay $80 per month to get a current 64GB iPhone with 7GB of mobile data, I also have 12 months of free Apple music. For me buying outright would cost a lot more. The plan you're talking about also comes with no phone support, not an major issue for me, but it is for some. How do I get that plan? I havent seen it advertised. Yeah "seem" cheaper to a simple person. You can give me $1000 now or $41.66 per month for 24 months. In reality if you do the sums on most carriers you end up paying more on plans now than outright purchase. My opinion is if you can't afford the $1350 outright you probably shouldnt be spending it on a phone anyway, but hey I'm old school and if you want to protect your wealth cash is king. Plans used to be the cheaper method to get a phone, but it seems like it's swung back around the other way. Providers used to be able to get the phones for much cheaper than retail, but the phone manufacturers have more power now. At a quick calculation I think I would save $200 over 24 months by buying outright and sticking with my current simcard. Exactly right. Looks like I'll be doing a trade in to get some $$$ of my old iPhone instead of giving it to the wife... Wow, over a thousand dollars for a phone that still only has a 750p screen. That's insane. I can't remember when the last Samsung phone has such a lowly screen. It must be four years ago at least. Yeah but whats the point in adding more pixels if your eye can't really notice it. I would rather a lower res screen if the phone will give me more than a days charge. I have the LG G4 screen is great but I have to charge my phone on the way home from work. With my Iphone 6S I'm still sitting around 25% by the time I get home. Plus majority of crap we view on our phones are all low res be it facebook or visiting a websites. Unless you have heaps of data you only really stream vids around 480p.\u000aI think Apple have stuck with 720p screens for this very reason, which makes sense. Only thing going for having a high res screen is bragging rights. If your phones screen is the only thing in your life thats worth bragging about than maybe you should get a hobby or new friends. Your eyes can notice it. The difference between the iPhone 6 screen and the Samsung 4k screen is huge. It would of been half reasonable if it was 1080p but 750p, really and you're defending that instead of belittling it. C'mon. Yeah I noticed a massive difference in screen qual going to the note 7 from the iphone 6. One of the reasons I'm waiting 3-4 weeks to have the battery issue fixed rather than just getting a different phone. I'm sooooo jealous. Love to have one but can't afford it right now. surely that is not correct ?      A 2016 device with a 720 screen ?\u000aI used to have a phone with a 720 screen about 4 years ago , and its quite usable , but  trust me mate , you can tell the difference ,\u000aif you are going to spend all that dosh on a new device with such a crap screen , its probably best you stay away from something with a good quality screen , other wise you are going to be severely dissappointed .\u000aAll the best with it anyway . dont buy it I guess How does the pre-ordering through Apple work exactly? Do you have to buy it outright, and do you have to go to a store to get it? Might wait and see what the Telstra plans are and just order through there. jump onto the apple store online and buy outright -  from tomorrow I guess you will have to put your name through first and then queue outside the apple store of your choice, and then let in by the apple employee to pay cash, card apple pay whatever and get your phone  Its like buying a luxury car .. bloody they make it look like that \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 12:06 pm								 haven't queued since the iphone4 - now you buy online and get it delivered to you on day of release $$1229 for an iphone 7 that still has a 750p screen from 2011, you are joking, the jokes on people who buy such outdated screen technology, i want the best as its the first and last thing we see on a phone. This has to be a joke. its the only way they can get the battery to last. Its not really , they could easily  put a bigger battery in it , but then it would not be razor blade thin, i dont understand  why  these phone makers think we need devices so thin you could carve fruit with it ? if you pre order from a telco do you actually get it on the release date (or soon after)?  do they post it out or do you go in store?  I usually order online through Apple but am considering getting on a plan this time. Apple running out of ideas or shy to follow android. Why does Apple have to force iPhone users to change headphone jacks? So that they can make more more money and not pay any tax in Australia?? I'm not buying this phone. There are better options for $500. I have never ever used the head phone jack. I have used every iPhone since the 3GS to the 5S and a Galaxy S5. My headphones have always been wireless (bluetooth). So I have no issue with Apple removing the headphone jack. Both my cars have bluetooth for audio. I will get the iPhone 7+ 32 GB on a plan.  When I got the Galaxy S5 on a plan with Telstra, checking my contract, the full cost of the handset was initially added ($840). I was then given a credit of $672. Hence all I paid for the handset as per my monthly bill was $7 per month for 24 months which equals $168. Added to this was the plan fee of $70 per month which was for calls & data. So in total I paid $77 per month ($70 calls & data plus $7 handset). Where could you get a brand new Galaxy S5 16GB for $168 in 2015? If I tell you will you go back and get one? Lovely justification for spending $1000+ dollars today though. Anyone know if preorders gets it delivered on the release date? I Preordered through Telstra last year, it was delivered by about 9am on Release date. What you haven't factored in is the extra 'warranty' under ACCC consumer law, if the phone is faulty during the course of your 2 year phone plan, you can take it to the apple store and they have to fix it for free (unless it is your fault it is broken). If you buy it outright, you only get 1 year warranty, you can pay extra for apple care to extend this and they also help to cover you for some accidental damage, so not entirely comparable. i  am waiting for this.......

VApple announced the iPhone 7 this morning and has nixed the 3.5mm audio headphone jack. It was a controversial decision and Apple is already copping heat for it, but it appears the Australian public is evenly divided on whether removing the headphone jack is a good or bad idea, according to research from analyst firm Telsyte.  In its Australian Smartphones & Wearables Device Market Study, Telsyte asked 1097 respondents aged 16 and over whether the removal of an analogue headphone jack would stop them from buying a smartphone. The result? Around 35 per cent said they would be put off from buying a new phone with no analogue headphone jack. Meanwhile, 34 per cent said they are not concerned. Nearly half of the respondents who said they are not fussed about losing the headphone jack are iOS users. The rest of the respondents said they were unsure. Here\u2019s a full breakdown of the results: Lifehacker Australia readers have been quite vocal on this issue. If you have an opinion about Apple\u2019s decision to give the 3.5 headphone jack the chop, tell us about it in the comments. All for it. Eliminates "cable squeek", tangles, snagging etc. And Bluetooth quality is these days as good as it needs to be listening to a portable device in most environs.\u000aThat said, Apple's choice won't bother me - I'm not going to be a customer of theirs. my only gripe is the fact that you can't use the headphones and charge the device at the same time. I am sure there will be adaptors, though that is still annoying. Much like how you can't charge the new MacBook and have any external storage added. It will be annoying, but in time it will be solved. Removing 3.5 mm headphone jack a good idea? First thought is no, mainly driven by having spend money on good headphones (AT-M50x).  But thinking a bit, an adaptor is not that hard to manage. Everyone who has good headphones would be able to easily find a 3.5mm to TRS/6.5mm adaptor (I have about 5 of these in my study drawer). This demonstrates we can deal with an adaptor. I think the issue is if it is necessary to remove it. What is the reason? The existing solution works and works very well, so why change what is not broken? To take 1mm off a phone? To save 10c in its construction? Apple prides itself on simplicity but has now added complexity. You can't listen to music and charge your phone without an adaptor or bluetooth headphones. I can't help but cynically believe this is a money grab on accessories and headphones. \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 3:27 pm								 Didnt think I would like moving to bluetooth, but have enjoyed it a lot. I have two sets of bluetooth headphones (Backbeat Go in-ear and Jabra over-ear)\u000aI've also kickstarted two more. Very rarly use cabled headphones unless I have a device that doesnt support it I'd love to know what Apple have done with all the space they freed up.\u000aThis generation iPhone is exactly the same external dimensions, but 4-5g lighter.\u000aYeah you get stereo speakers, but that's not exactly something I've ever cared about on a phone. I could only play music from my car stereo using an auxiliary cable - do I have to buy a new stereo to play music from a new iphone?  I'm not impressed. Im  pretty sure apple will sell plenty of propertiary cables and some sort of other propertiary cable for something else that dosent use the world universal thing. Even when usb c is on every android phone as well as apples mac they will provide an expensive propertiary cable for that to when they change to usb c, i mean that was the plan when they bought beats was to get everybody buying there wirless headphones even thou they have been around for years, but will now force everyone to buy bluetooth, very clever. As i said no one should worry as apple will just make something propertiary to cover any slight inconvience to the consumer, now open your wallets and stop complaining.

p566
VPalantir Technologies, the Peter Thiel-founded company known for its air of mystery and beer pong-friendly culture, has filed a lawsuit against early investor Marc Abramowitz, claiming he stole company secrets for his own gain and deceived company executives.\u000a\u000aAlex Karp, Palantir\u2019s CEO. (Image: Getty) The lawsuit, filed on September 1, was originally identified by Law.com and brought to our attention by Fortune. It\u2019s full of strongly worded accusations against Abramowitz, whom it calls a one-time \u201crespected confidant and advisor to Palantir\u201d. \u201cAs part of a brazen scheme to claim Palantir\u2019s own highly confidential information and trade secrets as his own, Abramowitz stole those secrets, engaged in methodical deception of Palantir\u2019s senior executives, and made false claims to the United States Patent and Trademark Office,\u201d read the lawsuit. Specifically, the lawsuit claims Abramowitz \u2014 who, like Palantir, appears to be shrouded in mystery and doesn\u2019t have much of an online presence \u2014 filed three patents based on the information he \u201cstole\u201d from Palantir, which the lawsuit decries as \u201cplainly illegal and highly unethical conduct\u201d. Abramowitz does indeed have several patents in which he\u2019s identified as the inventor. They cover areas like cyber security, cyber insurance and health and medical data. According to the lawsuit, Abramowitz used information he obtained from Palantir \u201cin confidence\u201d to file several of the applications. The company argues that Abramowitz\u2019s prior lack of experience as an inventor precludes the possibility that he filed the applications without help. More amusingly, Palantir\u2019s lawyers are also accusing Abramowitz of trying to trademark the term \u201cShire\u201d, which they say is yet another attempt to encroach on the company\u2019s territory. (Palantir\u2019s name is apparently a reference to The Lord of the Rings.) Aside from the patent catfights, Palantir also says it was forced to amend its investor agreement after lawyers for Abramowitz recently contacted the company demanding information. According to the suit, Abramowitz had access to all of this information because he had a \u201ctrusted relationship\u201d with the company. The early investor was apparently at Palantir\u2019s headquarters so much that he requested office space in 2014. Through another company, KT4 \u2014 which is also named as a co-defendant \u2014 Abramowitz initially invested in Palantir in 2005, which gave him access to confidential company information. This isn\u2019t Palantir\u2019s first visit to the legal rodeo. In 2011, it settled a lawsuit in which a competitor, i2, accused the company of unfairly obtaining software in order to create its own version. Palantir is currently embroiled in a legal dispute with the US Army \u201cover the way the Army solicits bids for its data intelligence technology used on battlefields worldwide\u201d, according to Bloomberg. We reached out to Palantir, its lawyers and Abramowitz, but had not heard back at time of writing. [Fortune] Palantir\u2019s lawyers are also accusing Abramowitz of trying to trademark the term \u201cShire\u201d, which they say is yet another attempt to encroach on the company\u2019s territory. (Palantir\u2019s name is apparently a reference to The Lord of the Rings.) "Hey you can't steal that because we stole it first!" This should be interesting though given how big Abramowitz is in Valley VC circles. Might have an chilling effect on innovation if start-ups start seriously worrying that their angel and VC investors are trying to steal their ideas (even though the rest of us already knew of course they were).

V\u000aIs this the car that\u2019s going to thrust electric vehicles (EVs) in to the mainstream? Certainly Tesla\u2019s charismatic chief executive Elon Musk thinks so. He has just announced 276,000 pre-orders in 48 hours for the company\u2019s latest EV, the Model 3. Expected to cost at least $35,000 when it ships in mid-2017, that means the company has secured $9.7 billion worth of sales for a car that is still over a year away from leaving the production line. In fact Musk estimates an average selling price of $42,000, once all the optional extras are taken into account, meaning that the actual revenue for Tesla could be even higher. Of course at present the only revenue is the $1,000 deposits for the cars which is just a small portion of the final sale price. However it is bound to help as the company now has an extra $276m in the bank to prepare for what\u2019s sure to be the company\u2019s most ambitious move yet. Featuring a four wheel drive system, the engine in the new 2017 Tesla Model 3 can obtain a maximum power output of 370 HP with target driving range expected to be 200 miles. We are also expecting that the new Model 3 will go 0-62mph in a time of 4.1 seconds. Other technology features include USB and Bluetooth connectivity, heated seats, rearview camera and Wi-Fi. Optional features may include the following: self-park, lane continue support, adaptive travel, and even automatic high and low ray headlights. Although the Model 3 is supposed to be delivered in 2017, there is a chance it could be late as the company\u2019s previous car, the Model X, eventually arrived three years late, due to problems moulding the seats for the car. The Model 3 will be the third major car in Tesla\u2019s fleet. The Model S, a luxury sedan, was launched in 2012, while the Model X, an SUV/people carrier crossover, was eventually launched last year. When it goes on sale it will competition from Chevrolet which at CES earlier this year also announced a similarly priced electric vehicle dubbed The Bolt. You can see Tech Digest\u2019s review of the Model S and its autopilot feature here.

VIt\u2019s happening. Following Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Scorpio announcement at E3, Sony is preparing to reveal its own super-charged console at its PlayStation Meeting event in New York City tomorrow. If you want to catch all the action live, here\u2019s what you need to know. Tomorrow\u2019s PlayStation Meeting will take place at the PlayStation Theatre in New York City, which means an early start for Aussie gamers. In addition to the Neo, it\u2019s also likely Sony will officially \u201cannounce\u201d the PlayStation 4 Slim to compete directly with the Xbox One S. (The Slim has suffered one of the most spectacular leaks in recent memory, with photos, unboxing videos and even customer reviews appearing online before Sony has even acknowledged the product exists.)  We also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Sony made some additional announcements for its upcoming virtual reality headset, the PlayStation VR. Here are the PlayStation Meeting 2016 details:  The press conference kicks off 8 September at 5am AEST. You can watch the live stream via PlayStation\u2019s LiveCast link.  Alternatively, you can follow the important announcements on PlayStation AU\u2019s Twitter account.  The tech savvy among you will have noticed that this event basically coincides with Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 reveal, which will also kick off in the week hours of the Australian morning. If you\u2019re an iOS fan, that gives you two reasons to set your alarm clock. See you bright and early gamers!

VMoney is just a tool, but it\u2019s hard to see it that way sometimes. Money is a top stressor for a lot of people, and the fact that it\u2019s such a taboo topic only makes the stress worse.\u000a Photo by Christopher As LearnVest points out, the American Psychological Association\u2019s annual Stress in America survey has found that stressed caused by money problems can have a big impact on both your mental and physical health. A study from Northwestern University found that participants with higher debt had more depressive symptoms and higher blood pressure. They reported: \u000aThose with higher debt were found to have a 1.3 per cent increase (relative to the mean) in diastolic blood pressure \u2014 which is clinically significant. A two-point increase in diastolic blood pressure, for example, is associated with a 17 per cent higher risk of hypertension and a 15 per cent higher risk of stroke.\u000a Talking isn\u2019t going to magically erase your financial problems, but it can help you cope. Dr. Mary Gresham, a psychologist who specialises in financial anxiety, told LearnVest: \u000a\u201cSocial support is one of the biggest stress-management tools that we have,\u201d Gresham says. She suggests hooking up with like-minded people via digital support groups or online sites where people unload their fears and share tips about getting a handle on their finances, she adds. That sense of community, even if it\u2019s anonymous, can be enormously comforting and reminds you that you\u2019re not the only one staying up at night panicking about bills.\u000a If you\u2019re looking for a place to start, there are a number of Facebook groups dedicated to opening up the conversation. NPR has a group called Your Money and Your Life, for example. Even if it\u2019s just a like-minded friend or family member you can trust, it\u2019s important to have room to vent about your anxiety so you can keep it at bay.

V// <![CDATA[\u000avar noskimwords = 'true';\u000a// ]]&gt;\u000a// <![CDATA[\u000avar noskimwlinks = 'true';\u000a// ]]&gt; Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario Maker has been described as the perfect tool to learn the basics of game design Over the last decade, gaming has really evolved. At one time almost all gaming took place offline, but now gamers spend most of their gaming time online, interacting with fellow players across the world in real time, and regularly competing in multinational tournaments. In many quarters, gaming is considered to be an \u2018e-sport\u2019 and the very best gamers play at a professional level, including online gamblers for whom the high cash prizes are a great draw. In fact, the industry has developed to such an extent that the most talented gamers are taking it one step further and creating their very own unique games using platforms designed exactly for this purpose. For example, Microsoft has recent stated that it will enable everyone to use the Xbox to develop, as well as to play games. By simply downloading an app, gamers will be able to transform the Xbox, and other consoles like it, into fun, free game creation tools. In doing so, they\u2019ll open up exciting new avenues of gaming potential. How about building a game based on your favourite sport, TV show or movie and inviting friends from across the globe to give it a whirl? Or, what about creating the game you and your real-world friends have always wished existed? For hobbyists who love their games, this is exciting news. It could also be the starting point for the great game designers of the future, equipping them with the building blocks to start exploring their creative potential from the comfort of their own homes. Not to be outdone by Microsoft, Nintendo has released its own platform for games creation \u2013 Super Mario Maker. This game creation system allows players to create and play their own custom-designed levels of Super Mario Bros. classic games. It was released late in 2015. The platform has been called \u2018a perfect tool to learn the basics of game design\u2019 because of the way in which it guides users progressively through the levels of game creation. People of all ages can let their imaginations run free, building enemies, monsters, rewards and tasks, which ultimately come together to form levels other users can try out. Over the past few years a number of \u2018indie\u2019 games have stormed the charts, proving that it\u2019s not just the \u2018big boys\u2019 who can create big-sellers and, when they\u2019re afforded the tools to do so, clever independent gamers can create masterpieces. Of course, the platforms discussed above guide their users through only the most rudimentary aspects of a game\u2019s design and build. Some types of games may prove far too challenging for the amateur game designer to build. Take, for example, online casinos, where most of the action undoubtedly takes place on the slot machines. The slot machine is one of the most complex games within an online casino and its design is often amended. As well as a games designer, mathematicians, testers, developers and other professionals are often involved in the build, adding extra layers of challenge to the task. While it may be relatively easy to start out building your own Mario Bros. level, some types of game design are best left to the experts. However, while platforms exist for talented youngsters to flex their creative and technological muscles, we can we sure that there\u2019ll always be people out there who are able to take our gaming experiences to the next level of pleasure.     Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VCredit: Getty Images\u000aMythbusters may have booted out its Three Musketeers shortly before the entire series was shut down, but the M7 Build Team is coming back with a new Netflix show about the dark corners of web science.  It's official! The White Rabbit Project is coming this Dec on @netflix with @grantimahara & @KariByron\u2026 https://t.co/6IAr7xBKrB \u2014 Tory Belleci (@ToryBelleci) September 3, 2016  The announcement came during a panel at DragonCon on Saturday. The new series, which stars Grant Imahara, Tory Belleci, and Kari Byron, will be called The White Rabbit Project. According to Nerdist, it was described at the panel as \u201cMythbusters in Wonderland,\u201d where they go down the rabbit hole of the internet to find topics and experiments. The panel included a teaser clip of Byron and Belleci enjoying some wine while trying out an experiment. One person said Byron was controlling a wired-up Belecci remotely, while another said they were both hooked up to wires and Byron was trying to induce electronic muscle stimulation. Either way, sounds pretty cool. Imahara\u2019s also been sharing tons of photos on his Twitter account from his \u201cnew show\u201d since he started filming earlier this year. Given it includes photos of him pushing \u201cFire\u201d buttons and dressing up like Dr. Horrible, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s probably the same program. Plus, there\u2019s these guys. Kinda gives it away. Look at these happy faces on the first day of studio filming! #newshow @ToryBelleci @KariByron pic.twitter.com/vFdnnntouZ \u2014 Grant Imahara (@grantimahara) May 23, 2016  The White Rabbit Project is originally the name of a mid-2000s internet project involving industry and university professionals, which was designed to make a fully deterministic (i.e. not random) Ethernet-based network for speedy data transfer. The Netflix show will likely have less Synchronous Ethernet and more robot arms making shitty sandwiches. All I\u2019m saying is Simone Giertz better damn well make a cameo. http://gizmodo.com/simone-giertzs\u2026 The White Rabbit Project debuts on Netflix Dec. 9. One panel attendee said it will run for 10 episodes. [Nerdist] To me Mythbusters is Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage. Those other three were little more than comic relief. I hear ya, but was that their limitations, or by design?  With Jamie and Adam focussing more and more on the more in depth stuff, these three wouldnt have had any chance to do similar.  Show settled into a routine of one big and one light myth, and these three rarely got to do the big ones. With the decade or more they were on the show by the end, it will be interesting to see how they do on their own.  Who knows, it could just be more of the light stuff they did well on Mythbusters.  Which for a lot of people would be enough. Dunno what it'll be like. Later on in myth busters those 3 just turned into the blow it up section. As opposed to Adam and Jamie that did more in depth stuff. I tend to agree, but the .50 cal phonebook armour was quite entertaining. these three never looked comfortable in front of the camera. all you see is multiple shots of bad acting. And that is the reason I found them more informative. Adam's over acting everything always grated on me and Jamie's forced indifference was just boring. Are you guys serious ? Build team were the BEST part of Mythbusters. Hope this comes to Aussie Netflix ! You had me at Kari Byron. A show with just grant would have been fine, The other two tended to be overly cringeworthy at points in Mythbusters.

VTo say that George R. R. Martin\u2019s Winds of Winter is very, very highly anticipated is putting it very, very mildly \u2014 so any micro-crumb of information regarding a release date is going to attract attention. Today\u2019s pulse-quickening clue comes courtesy of Amazon\u2019s French site, which has a release date for the book listed.\u000a\u000aThe HBO adaptation\u2019s plot has already moved beyond the events of Martin\u2019s most recent book in the series. It\u2019s 9 March 2017 \u2014 specifically noted as being for the paperback, rather than the traditional hardback initial release, which only adds to the sketchy believability of the news. To reiterate: This comes with no confirmation from Martin, who will surely share the good news once he\u2019s finally finished working on the thing that\u2019s been hanging over his head since July 2011, when A Dance With Dragons was released. The date could just be an Amazon placeholder, or a mistake, a prank or a glimpse into a parallel reality. Martin\u2019s most recent blog post went up September 3, and it\u2019s all about the latest Wild Cards novel, High Stakes. A commenter mentions the French Amazon page there, but there\u2019s no response from the author, who frequently writes back to his fans when they ask questions in that forum. Obviously, we\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for any kind of confirmation or denial\u2026 but we don\u2019t expect one either way. We do, however, expect to be kept waiting much longer than 9 March 2017 to finally read The Winds of Winter. [Entertainment Weekly]

VEE\u2019s buffer face campaign. The brand is almost certain to disappear completely following BT acquisition It says a lot about the fast moving and fickle tech world we live in that a brand can have so much money spent on it in terms of marketing and advertising, only for it to disappear after three years. Because that\u2019s what seems to be about to happen to EE following its £12.5 billion acquisition by communications behemoth BT. EE boss Olaf Swantee has already stepped down from his role and BT boss Gavin Patterson has refused to rule out the EE brand being axed, although he says it will not happen in the \u201cshort term\u201d. Other analysts have predicted the days of the EE brand name are numbered. Kester Mann, who is principal operators analyst at CCS Insight, says it is \u201cinconceivable that the EE brand won\u2019t go\u201d. BT wants to market a quad play offering to customers, comprising TV, Broadband, Landline and Mobile in one, and it will simply be too confusing if they have to choose between different brands. And whatever you think of those cheesy ads with Kevin Bacon and the slightly annoying \u2018buffer face\u2019 campaign, it does seem like a huge waste of money to pull the plug on a brand which was just starting to get some consumer recognition as well as awards from the industry. Launched in 2012 by Everything Everywhere, EE was actually formed in 2010 as a joint venture between T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom and Orange. The T-Mobile and Orange brands were withdrawn in February 2015 in favour of the EE brand. And now it looks certain that EE will disappear in favour of the BT brand!       Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

V// <![CDATA[\u000avar noskimwords = 'true';\u000a// ]]&gt;\u000a// <![CDATA[\u000avar noskimwlinks = 'true';\u000a// ]]&gt; \u000aIn Association with PRGRMTK  The use of programmatic advertising has risen greatly since the advent of the internet. Using software to purchase advertising en masse has never been easier; previously, the buying process involved meeting with executives, listening to sales pitches and then having to negotiate. Now, it\u2019s all on the table beforehand; rates, information and contract terms are all set in stone before anyone goes in to the agreement. Often, nobody speaks to anyone in the entire automated process. But there are still a number of myths and misconceptions about programmatic advertising. It\u2019s Quicker Whilst it is now far more convenient to just log in, make purchases and choose which outlets will carry advertising, getting to that stage can now take quite some time. The industry is awash with companies all offering the same service, and they vary in both reliability and trustworthiness. As such, trawling through the fakery, the bold promises and the companies that just don\u2019t meet the fit have largely taken the place of meeting up and negotiating the purchase. It\u2019s Foolproof Unfortunately, as everyone knows, the internet is a haven for fraud and nefarious activity. Many online programmatic advertising sellers will make promises of advertising appearing in print, TV/radio and online media, yet with these outfits they rarely deliver on the service sold. Mainstream websites are often named as those that will carry ads, but in actual fact the sites are little known copycats or, worse still, virtually dead websites created solely by the advertisers for the sole purpose of carrying the ads they\u2019ve sold. \u2018One Size Fits All\u2019 Many advertising sales outfits are on the ball in this respect. Put quite simply, the difference between laptops, tablets and mobile phones may be subtle to the untrained eye, but if not worked around correctly they can effectively negate the effectiveness of any marketing. Two of the biggest problems are screen optimisation and cookies. On a laptop, it\u2019s a rather straightforward process. But on a mobile, ads need to be scaled down, and cookies are largely ineffective on phone-based browsers. Again, any decent programmatic marketer will be one step ahead and has factored this in, but there are a plethora of companies that are still running ineffective ads as a result of these differences. It\u2019s an Unknown Quantity The horror stories of programmatic advertising gone wrong shouldn\u2019t dissuade any buyer per se; they should instead keep them astute and mindful of the risks. The industry has greatly moved on as a whole from when it started. Advertisers can now directly target ads at pretty much any demographic, a far cry from the mid 90s and early millennial advertising that was largely based around invasive and unpopular banner ad campaigns. Ads Can\u2019t Be Targeted As Well Again, the ability to target is now more honed in and developed than ever before. Want to buy space in the top 10% of viewed shooting and fishing websites? Need ads to directly reflect services based on what the intended target has been visiting in the last week? The ability to track user behaviour digitally has enabled programmatic marketing to be so well targeted that it has all but negated the need for market research in many industries. It Replaces The Need For Having Purchasing Staff Whilst programmatic marketing from companies like PRGRMTK has opened up the doors of purchasing to a wider audience, purchasing staff still need to know where to buy, what they\u2019re buying and who they want to target for campaigns. Getting an untrained staffer to start clicking and buying is likely to result in wildly misguided advertising campaigns. The whole process is now a highly developed, well oiled machine and, if used properly, can really simplify the whole buying dynamic. However, it\u2019s important not to get fooled into a false sense of security. The considerations of buying ad space digitally have simply replaced those that came with print advertising 20 years ago. Remaining astute, but not overly cynical, strikes an ideal balance.   Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

Image: ESA/Hubble & NASA N159 measures about 150 light-years across and it contains an abundance of hot young stars. At the centre of this cloud is the Papillon Nebula, which as its name suggests, has a butterfly-like appearance. Astronomers refer to this particular nebula as a High-Excitating Blob (HEB), and it has been linked to the early stages of massive star formation. The Papillon Nebula\u2019s shape may be formed by the outflow of gas coming from the strong stellar winds of newborn massive stars, some of which are 10 times the size of our sun. This image was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, which happens to be the first telescope to ever capture this nebula in any sort of detail. [NASA]

V A security expert has found a way to steal the login credentials from a computer even when it\u2019s locked down by a password \u2014 all with a tiny USB device. The hack can be carried out in less than 30 seconds and the hardware to do this costs around US$50. Read on to find out more.  Rob Fuller, also known by the moniker mubix, is a security engineer at R5 Industries. He recently wrote a blog post about a Hak5 Turtle hacking tool, a device that looks like a USB Ethernet adaptor, to steal login credentials from computers that are password locked. You can buy the Hak5 Turtle for around US$50 and its meant to give system administrators and security testers the ability to covertly gain remote access to devices for legitimate reasons. It is essentially a tiny computer that runs Linux. To capture the login credentials, Fuller loaded Responder on the Hak5Turtle and configured it to perform the hack. You can find the full details on his blog post. He also posted a video that shows the device in action:  Once the authentication hash is stolen, it can be manipulated to gain unauthorised access on a system. From Fuller\u2019s test results, this hack works on: But how is this even possible, and with such ease? Fuller explained: \u201cBecause USB is Plug-and-Play. This means that even if a system is locked out, the device still gets installed. Now, I believe there are restrictions on what types of devices are allowed to install at a locked out state on newer operating systems (Win10/El Capitan), but Ethernet/LAN is definitely on the white list.\u000a \u000a\u201cComputers are constantly creating traffic, even if you don\u2019t have any browsers or applications open, and most computers trust their local network for some reason (I know the technical bits on \u2018why\u2019, just complaining\u2026). Network preference when there are more than gateway or network connection is based on \u201cmetrics\u201d on Windows and a combination of metrics and \u201cpreference\u201d on OSX, but by default \u201cwired\u201d and \u201cnewer/faster\u201d always win out.\u201d\u000a \u000a\u201cThis means that by plugging in the device it quickly becomes the gateway, DNS server, WPAD server and others thanks to Responder.\u201d The average time it has taken him to steal login credentials from a locked machine is 13 seconds.

VPistachios\u2026for now (Image: Safa.daneshvar)\u000aEat them while you can, people. Pistachios are about to become a whole lot less available.  The USDA recently released a report showing that the United States, one of the world\u2019s two main pistachio producers, would cut the number of pistachios it harvested by nearly half this year due mainly to the state\u2019s punishing drought. This means a loss of over 100,000 tons of pistachios in the U.S. alone \u2014 an amount equal to nearly a fifth of the world\u2019s entire 520,000 ton pistachio crop for this year. Now, a worsening drought in Iran, the other top producer of pistachios in the world, has farmers there predicting that their pistachio harvest is also going to continue to fall dramatically \u2014 perhaps even further than the 20,000 ton drop that was already predicted for this year. USDA says worldwide we\u2019re going to lose 86,000 tons of pistachios this year. That figure sounds unsettlingly big, but the losses would look heavier yet if Turkey hadn\u2019t had a surprise bumper crop which nearly tripled its expected harvest. Even that anomaly, though, still wasn\u2019t enough to offset the loses. Pistachios join chocolate, red wine, IPAs, salmon, coffee, almonds, and so much more on the list of foods that are going to get harder to come by in our hotter and drier world. On the plus side, however, the world market for edible insects continues to grow. You need to be careful with the units. The USDA report (link in the article) is talking about tonnes not tons. Tonne is metric and is 1000kg but ton is 2000 pounds. \u000a									Last edited September 5, 2016 11:10 pm								 Good ol' progressive US of A persisting with the imperial system of measurement.

V The technology profession is the most recession proof in the UK, at least according to an analysis of ONS (Office of National Statistics) and professional industry data carried by IT recruiter, Randstad Technologies. The analysis ranks each occupation by the change in the aggregate wage bill for full-time staff between 2002 and 2014, adjusting for inflation. Those in IT jobs have survived the economic crisis better than any other profession due to the growing demand for technology across the UK, supported by rapid growth in the size of tech workforce with an additional 400,000 people working IT jobs since 2002. The total wage bill for full-time employees in IT jobs has risen 82% in real terms from £17.4bn in 2002 to £31.6bn in 2014, reaching 5% of the total wage bill for all UK full time employees. Oxford Economics has forecast that the number of tech businesses in the country will rise to 51,500 by 2025. The least recession-proof occupation is travel agency, where the total wage bill for full-time staff collapsed from £946m in 2002 to £420m in 2014, down 56%. The number of travel agents nearly halved to 23,000 in this period and those who have remained have seen a 6% decline in real wages. Says Ruth Jacobs, managing director of Randstad Technologies: \u201cThe demand for people will advanced IT skills will only grow in the future, as Britain will need 2.2 million digitally skilled workers by 2020 to match the sector\u2019s potential. \u201cThis means that if you are qualified for software developer jobs, data analyst jobs or network engineer jobs, it will be easier to find work, with almost no chance of being laid off long periods of time\u201d Chris Sheard, sales manager at Randstad Technologies, concludes: \u201cThe South West has been the engine driving tech through the tough economic turmoil. With industry giants like Vodafone, Toshiba and IBM already established along the M4 Corridor, the area has become a thriving hub for the UK Tech Sector. \u201cThe Silicon Gorge area between Bath and Bristol has been the faster growing tech cluster outside of London  during this period, with new start-ups providing the fuel which has kept the industry racing forward. \u201cBy its nature, the tech industry is relatively future-proof which has allowed it to survive the economic crash relatively unscathed. This has helped the South West stay afloat when other industries were going under. While the real average salary in tech may have slipped slightly due to the recession, tech jobs in the South West are still 37% higher than the regional average.\u201d     Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VEver since LCD TVs hit the scene about 10 years ago, we\u2019ve seen small and incremental changes \u2014 better backlighting, higher quality panels. The last couple of years has been tumultuous, though, and 4K is now a thing (you\u2019d be silly to buy a TV without it). With that done, TV makers are back to the minor iterative updates. But it\u2019s 2016, and even those updates are pretty damn cool. Samsung\u2019s continued development of its quantum dot LED-backlit LCD televisions continues to pay dividends in the screens\u2019 wide colour gamut, LG\u2019s OLED TVs support more HDR standards than ever, and Sony\u2019s LED backlights are continually more powerful and versatile. But these changes aren\u2019t the kind of thing that you\u2019ll be able to see clearly when you\u2019re buying your next TV. The most obvious differences are away from the screen itself.  At IFA this year, Philips showed off a 4K, HDR-ready OLED TV \u2014 a really slick thing, with a thin chassis and straightforward modern styling. But it\u2019s not the TV\u2019s picture so much that stood out \u2014 being an OLED, that already means excellent contrast and deep black levels, albeit without the high maximum brightness of a LED screen.   It\u2019s the fact that Philips has imbued the 901F with its Ambilight LED screen-lighting system, a series of red-green-blue LEDs around the rear of the panel that reflect light off your wall while you\u2019re watching, mirroring the content that you\u2019re watching to reduce eye fatigue and create a beautiful visual effect. It\u2019s a small extra feature, but it looks incredible and makes a quantum of difference \u2014 you either have it or you don\u2019t.  Danish design and technology house Bang & Olufsen has the cleanest ever implementation of Android TV I\u2019ve ever seen in the new BeoVision Horizon, a 4K Ultra HD TV built around the company\u2019s minimalist styling. It looks great, and works even better, and as you\u2019d expect the Horizon\u2019s picture quality flatters any high-quality media that is played through it. But, again, it\u2019s not Android or the design that might appeal most to buyers. It\u2019s the fact that B&O has spent years building a multi-room, multi-speaker audio system that works seamlessly, letting you connect a soundbar or stereo speakers or an entire house of audio and play your TV and movies through them. That might sound like a small extra, but when you experience it, you realise the importance that it has.  IFA this year was the most obvious demonstration of this that I\u2019ve seen yet. With 4K here, HDR here, and OLED and quantum dot panels and LED backlighting getting continuously better than ever, most of all TVs that you can buy in 2016 are going to look amazing. It\u2019s what they have extra that will tip the scales in their favour. [Philips] "4K is now a thing (you\u2019d be silly to buy a TV without it)." Why? I still buy DVDs over Blu-Ray if it is even $2 cheaper because, on my full HD TV, the difference isn't worth paying for, given where I sit to watch it. 4k is just going to put your power bills up for something you can't even see. Worse than that, though, is that it is likely to show up all the compression artifacts in the things you watch far more because it will encourage you to sit closer so you can see the difference. Philips have had that back-lighting thing for many years now. A mate of mine has had one for more than five years, maybe as long as ten (but probably somewhere in between). It works really well sometimes, not so well at others. As for HDR, it is completely pointless unless the TV has 10 bit or greater colour range. If it's just a normal 8 bits per pixel panel, and it almost certainly is, then it cannot display HDR, it can only read it and squash it into the available gamut, either using look-up tables (LUTs) or by filtering the blacks and whites. ...it is likely to show up all the compression artifacts in the things you watch far more because it will encourage you to sit closer so you can see the difference.This seems very unlikely in a properly encoded 4K H265 video stream. There is a very obvious difference between DVD and Blu-Ray, my favourite movies that i already had on DVD, i have upgraded to Blu-ray because they look so much better. and again you watch something in 4k you cant say DVD even almost compares. watching DVD to me is like watching a VHS. yes you r right. Even on my sub standard 1300 res 50 in the difference between dvd and blu ray is very notable and worth the upgrade.....now im running a 1080 gpu in my pc thru this but wont benefit from the difference, though even in 720 i can already see clarification and obviously better fps. The prob is its always another thing to but to compliment the system..next i need my amp upgraded soley for my hdmi inputs, no bell s or whistles just connectivity...then a 4 k tv  to benefit the gpu an don it goes.\u000aAt what point do we just sit comfortable with old tech and say HEY, it Works ? :) Ugh, I had to upgrade my old Technics amp for the same reason. Bought in... '89 I think. Still working perfectly but no HDMI :( Was going to replace it with an Onkyo that was on special but while thinking about it they sold the last unit. Wound up with a Pioneer one. Not as nice but still decent. Far more bells and whistles than the Technics but I reckon the sound quality is no better. The difference between VHS - DVD - Bluray - 4k Blu is funny. I remember watching VHS movies and thinking they looked fine, but after DVD came out VHS just looked bearable. Once Bluray came out VHS looked atrocious. Interesting how our perceptions change with the technology. I don't even have an LCD tv - using a sony trinitron crt from 2001 - but for me there is a noticable difference between dvd and bluray. That said, lack of any upscalers could be playing a part in that. On my 60" panny plasma the difference between 1080p bluray and dvd is huge. On my 120" sony lcos projector bluray is a must, i wont even watch dvds on it. That being said ill be waiting for a decent price on a 4k projector before i embrace the new tech. Still more than happy with the plasma and looks better than most 4k leds ive seen. Pretty sure the article wasn't saying "go out and replace your TV with a 4k one". It's point was more that if you are already planning to buy a TV then it makes sense to buy a 4k one. After all it's not like your new 4k TV can't still play DVDs on it. In fact a lot of them have good upscaling algorithms that make DVDs look better at 4k. You're right that in general 4k TVs use more power than HD. However, that's dependent on model and as tech improves the power usage decreases anyway. For example, from what I can find my old LG 42LD560 ran about 180W (on) and my new Hisense 50k321UW runs about 145W. So in fact going to a bigger TV and gaining 4k instead of just HD is actually reducing my power usage by about 35W. Also even if your new 4k TV is less power efficient than your HD one chances are we're talking a few dollars a year. http://www.geek.com/chips/4k-tvs-use-30-more-power-backlights-and-processing-power-to-blame-1639893/ As for HDR, they're talking 10 and 12bit not 8bit (that's standard HD TVs). From the look of it a manufacturer can't claim a TV is HDR unless it's 10bit or better. Now whether you think it looks better/worse/the same is a different issue. http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/137367-what-is-hdr-what-tvs-support-hdr-and-what-hdr-content-can-i-watch I would still advise people looking to buy a tv to either get a oled or find a high end plasma second hand. Havent seen an led yet thag doesnt struggle with dark scenes. Problem with Plasma is they do use a lot more power (which also explains why they run hotter). About ten times as much from what I read. That's starting to get into the noticeable amount. Well that and the fact they've pretty much been phased out so buying second hand means you lose other features and repairs (parts) are going to be problematic. Except that hasnt been the case for years. Both plasma and lcd tvs use bugger all power. Plasmas dont run full power the whole time it depends on the light output unlike lcds that run full power constantly so the difference in real world use is marginal. I bought a vt60 panasonic plasma for $950 so would take 30 years im extra to break even over a new lcd. If it breaks down and i can't fix it ive saved enough it wouldnt matter. Who has been making plasmas recently though? I assume they're still being made but for the average consumer you don't see many in stores. From one of the articles I used for power information on my earlier posts (it's 2013 so not that long ago). http://www.cnet.com/au/news/what-you-need-to-know-about-tv-power-consumption/ A 2016 article, check out the operating power requirements on some of these, while some of big (60/65 inch) they're also only HD screens. http://www.toptenreviews.com/electronics/tv/best-plasma-tvs/ I take your point about lower light output requiring less power, but I wonder how much benefit that is in reality? Unless you're watching something that is very dark for the majority of the time? I certainly wouldn't go replacing a decent working Plasma with an LCD just to try to save power costs though. Even at the worst power estimate for Plasma it'd take ages for the difference to pay off. If however I was buying because I had to (TV was dead for example) I'd certainly take power into consideration. Just like the same thinking when it comes to HD -v- UHD. I don't think the jump was enough to warrant buying one when I had a perfectly good HD TV, but when it died it made sense to go UHD. I agree with alot lf what you are saying I just havent found an lcd that can handle dark scenes well and a lot of the sci fi, comic book and movies I watch are often very dark scenes and I hate that shiney grey look it gets. I'd want to have a good play with one in a darkroom to fork out cash. Hence why my advice would be if youre going to spend a lot get oled and if you cant afford one of those get a second hand plasma. The late model high end panasonics and samsungs are the only ones to look at. Sadly it's pretty hard to get that sort of testing in most retail places. I know there was one (Todds maybe) that used to have decent isolated testing areas, but they were selling higher end than the JB and Harvey Norman type stuff. I think some videopro stores have light controlled theatre rooms in brisbane. Not sure about other cities. Also who needs "smart" features when a chromecast and htpc beats any on the market.

VPokemon GO, water resistance, advanced fitness tracking, built-in GPS for phone-free running, Apple Pay \u2014 meet the Apple Watch Series 2, with its brighter display, dual-core processor and improved ease of use. To have it work for you, you\u2019ll need to be running iPhone 5 or later running iOS 10 (releasing 14 September) or later. Of course, you could do that by buying a new iPhone 7. Fitness is a real focus, and the Apple Watch Series 2 is actually swimproof (rated water resistant 50 metres under ISO standard 22810:2010) \u2014 an upgrade on the last model\u2019s splash proof design. This means that it may be used for \u201cshallow-water\u201d activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. Scuba diving, waterskiing or \u201cother activities involving high-velocity water or submersion below shallow depth\u201d are off the cards, though. Oh, and the stainless steel and leather bands are not water resistant. Swimmers aren\u2019t left out of fitness this time \u2014 if anything, they are totally catered for. You can track indoor laps and open water swims, laps, swim times, calorie burn it automatically detects stroke type and it\u2019s tailored to your strokes \u2014 not a \u201cstandard\u201d swimmer \u2014 using new algorithms.  The waterproofing is make possible by the one thing that was previously stopping it \u2014 the speaker. Now it actually expels water. Yep.  There\u2019s built-in GPS, everyone. You\u2019ll get GPS accurate pace, speed and distance without taking your phone along with you. You can start an outdoor workout whenever you want, since Wi-Fi, GPS and locally stored satellite data works out where you are straight away.  New fitness and health capabilities include the breakthrough Breathe app, designed to encourage users to take a moment in their day to do deep breathing exercises for relaxation and stress reduction.  The Activity app now includes the ability to share, compare and compete, keeping friends and family motivated. There is also a customised experience for wheelchair users to close their Activity rings, in addition to dedicated workouts.  When you\u2019re finished an outside workout a map pops up to show variations in speed in the Activity app on iPhone. All of your activity is counted towards the Stand, Move and Excercise rings on the app \u2014 running, swimming, walking etc. Nike+ is coming to Apple Watch too, with it\u2019s own special device designed with runners in mind. You can tell Siri to start a run, or wait to the app to nag you \u2014 Every. Single. Day. The main screen of the Apple Watch will not only show which Pokemon are nearby, it will natively track your distance, calories and you can hatch you eggs on-screen \u2014 it will even show you. uses a complication on the Apple Watch watchface to show how far it\u2019ll take to hatch any eggs that you\u2019re incubating, with a haptic feedback tap when PokeStops are nearby and a swipe from the watch to pick up items. You can\u2019t catch Pokemon, though \u2014 you\u2019ll need to take out your phone for that. Pokemon GO has been downloaded over 500 million times around the world, and trainers have walked more than 4.6 billion kilometres playing the game. Pokemon GO on the Apple Watch will be available \u201cbefore the end of the year\u201d. The display is the brightest Apple has ever shipped \u2014 more than twice as bright, in fact \u2014 at 1000 nits. This means viewing the screen outside is a lot easier. Apple Watch Series 2 has a dual-core processor that\u2019s 50 per cent faster and a graphics chip that\u2019s twice as powerful \u2014 making apps like Night Sky work at faster frame rates and with more detail.  watchOS 3 boasts \u201csignificantly\u201d improved performance,  and you can launch apps from either from the watch face or with the new Dock, which displays the latest information already updated in the background. It will be available beginning 14 September as a free software update. There are new watch faces including Minnie Mouse, Activity and Numerals. Simply swipe edge-to-edge to swap out a new watch face, or use the new Face Gallery in the Apple Watch app on iPhone, to customise watch faces and find third-party apps. There\u2019s a new material for the watch \u2014 ceramic! Four times harder than stainless steel, which it is also available in, as well as lightweight aluminium. There\u2019s a \u201ca wide variety of gorgeous new band colours\u201d to choose from, too.  Apple Watch is available in two different case sizes, 38mm and 42mm. Apple Watch Series 2 will be available in gold, rose gold, silver or space grey aluminium, or silver or space black stainless steel cases paired with a wide variety of bands starting at RRP A$529 inc. GST. Apple Watch Series 1 is still available, too \u2014 but with the new powerful dual-core processor and GPU. It will cost $399. The new ceramic Apple Watch Edition starts at RRP A$1,799 inc. GST Pre-orders for the Apple Watch Series 1, Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Edition start 9 September, with availability on 16 September. Apple Watch Nike+ starts at RRP A$529 inc. GST.

Screen isn't always on, and even then it barely gets 18hrs. This is terrible. "The display is the brightest Apple has ever shipped".  I would hope so given this is only the second device.  The Apple rhetoric of everything being the best of anything ever gets so tiresome. No, they mean ever. Across all devices. Not "It's brighter than the last one". I have a bridge in Sydney I'd like to sell you! Totally agree with you, so many "This is the fastest iPhone we have built, the longest battery life, the brightest display, yada yada". It's been like one year since the last one, you obviously can't make a slower or dimmer one. the orininal is an ok smart watch. not super intuitive or exciting, but ok. now the second iteration is out and guess what it looks just like the first. must be an Apple product. Everything you need to know about the apple watch series 2???? How about you give us a break down on what the different apple watch series 2 offers? What do you get in a Nike+ Watch? What's so special about the ceramic Apple Watch Series 2? Has the processor changed in the Apple Watch Series 2? I can keep going but when you make an article that begins with "EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW..." I don't even know how to choose an Apple Watch Series 2 Pretty sure the nike is just the basic with a nike band, but I'd like an answer to that question also.

VEver since NORAD\u2019s Cheyenne Mountain underground facility became fully operational in 1966, it\u2019s been America\u2019s command and control centre for the nuclear apocalypse. But photos from inside the top secret bunker, even historical ones, are incredibly rare. Yesterday the folks over at Memory Hole 2 helped make them a bit less rare by uploading some hard-to-find NORAD photos published in 1970.  Original caption from 1970: AIR DEFENCE WATCH \u2014 These display screens would display signs of air attack against Canada and the United States. By pushing buttons, the NORAD battle staff members can take an electronic look at the tracks of space satellites or aircraft, which are chartered on the display by computers This is the nerve center which would give the first warning of attack, and the command post from which NORAD battle commanders would direct the defensive air battle. (Photo scanned by Memory Hole 2 from the book NORAD Command Post: The City Inside Cheyenne Mountain by Henry W. Hough) The largest batches of photos from the Cheyenne Mountain facility appear in just two spots: a 1966 official NORAD report by David W. Shircliffe, which is available online, and a 1970 book titled NORAD Command Post: The City Inside Cheyenne Mountain by Henry W. Hough. The book is out of print, and only available at 27 libraries around the world. So the good folks at Memory Hole 2 have scanned and uploaded the photos. Original caption from 1970: DISTINGUISHED VISITORS \u2013 Richard M. Nixon is September 1969 became the first U.S. President to visit the underground command post of the North American Air Defence Command. He is shown here in NORAD\u2019s Space Defence Center being briefed by General Seth J. McKee, commander in chief of NORAD. Left to right are: Gordon Allott, U.S. Senator from Colorado; President Nixon; General McKee; Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Presidential assistant; Peter H. Dominick, U.S. Senator from Colorado; and John N. Mitchell, U.S. Attorney General. (Photo scanned by Memory Hole 2 from the book NORAD Command Post: The City Inside Cheyenne Mountain by Henry W. Hough) There are other historical photos here and there from the NORAD facility that haven\u2019t appeared in the Shircliffe report and the Hough book. But these scans from the Hough book are a great contribution to this gigantic Xerox machine we call the internet. There\u2019s also more recent footage from the facility, as NORAD has occasionally allowed news organisations (like USA Today) inside, which you can find if you type the right magic words into the Google box. But wasn\u2019t everything so much simpler in the olden days? We hear it from our parents and politicians all the time. Back in the good old days everything was so much better \u2014 like the constant threat of nuclear annihilation from the Soviet Union, for instance. Original caption from 1970: PATHS OF A SATELLITE \u2013 Deep within Colorado\u2019s Cheyenne Mountain are large display screens which show what is going on in space. These screens in the NORAD Combat Operations Center can show the routes space satellites will take as they circle the earth, such as the ones here charted by a computer. By pushing buttons the battle staff members can see the paths a satellite will follow for as many as twelve revolutions in the future. While guarding the continent against air attack, the command is also responsible for keeping tabs on space objects orbiting the earth. (Photo scanned by Memory Hole 2 from the book NORAD Command Post: The City Inside Cheyenne Mountain by Henry W. Hough) [Memory Hole 2] Cheyenne Mountain hasn't been NORAD HQ since 2008. It has a care taker staff now. That's all.

VHappy Loop Day, everyone. Oh, you didn\u2019t know it was Loop Day? That\u2019s OK, it\u2019s basically every day for the special youngsters from Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children. Because they\u2019re always about to be killed by Nazis.\u000a\u000aPhoto Credit: 20th Century Fox  20th Century Fox released a new clip from the upcoming Tim Burton-helmed fantasy. In it, stars Eva Green and Asa Butterfield discuss how Miss Peregrine is able to keep the children safe from the dark forces that pursue them. In basic terms, Miss Peregrine uses her power of time manipulation to make them live the same day over and over again. But, if you look at it more closely, it gets super depressing. Turns out, the children live every single day moments from death. According to Slashfilm, the island is frozen in time on 3 September 1943, and Miss Peregrine resets the clock to the previous 24 hours right before the island is attacked by German forces. It helps explain the Nazi bombs we saw in the previous trailer. In celebration of this everlasting Dia de los Muertos, the movie hosted \u201cLoop Day\u201d. Anyone who sent their photo to @PeregrinesMovie with the hashtag #StayPeculiar on Saturday received a distressed photo or GIF explaining their superpowers. One girl got the gift of style, which kind of seems like cheating, if we\u2019re being honest. Also, here\u2019s a clip of an official Miss Peregrine clock, because time is always ticking away from us as we get closer to the brink, and one day the magic will run out and we\u2019ll watch helplessly as the Germans bomb us to kingdom come. Happy Loop Day!  [Entertainment Weekly] Well if you read the book this is actually part of the main storyline. I'll admit there is a lot of deviation from the first book but I'm still not sure if they plan to release the movie based on the first book or a mashup of all 3 (most likely just he first) though how they end the first movie is going to be the biggest question, are we going to end up with another Golden Compass? (Phillip Pullman) loved the books.   To be honest, this series and Philip Reeves' Mortal Engines series are the best I've read in quite a while and I'm really hoping the movie lives up to the books weirdness.   I see there are a few changes to the kids powers but I can accept that without a tantrum. .  There's adequate room for flexibility in the story.    Please though good folks of movieland, don't attempt Mortal Engines.  please..

VDear Lifehacker. Should I even bother washing my hands after doing a pee? Is there even a point? Aren\u2019t my hands just covered in germs constantly anyway? Surely even the door handle on the public toilet is covered in germs? Should I bother washing my hands after doing a wee?  Mark Hi Mark, That\u2019s a valid question given that washing your hands often feels more like a safeguard against judgement from others rather than something that is done for our health. You know you\u2019ll get the evil eye if somebody sees you not washing your hands after going to the bathroom. So should you wash your hands if you don\u2019t care about the peer pressure? For some men, they are comforted by the fact that their junk is sufficiently clean so they don\u2019t feel the need to wash their hands if they haven\u2019t accidentally peed on them; just shake it off, and move on. Maybe some women don\u2019t feel like they need to wash after they wipe either. Unfortunately, science (and the government) tells us that you should definitely wash your hands after going to the loo, even if you don\u2019t feel the need to do it. A number of infectious diseases such as Salmonella and influenza can be spread by contaminated hands. Sure, the bathroom door can have germs and other nasties on it but you\u2019re more likely to get your hands dirty from the toilet paper, the toilet seat and the flush button or handle. Also, for men who assume that their junk is squeaky clean, are you guys even sure you\u2019re doing it right? Everybody\u2019s standards for cleanliness is different. Giving it a rinse in your daily shower doesn\u2019t exactly count. The groin area can be a ripe breeding ground for bad bacteria, which can lead to odour and diseases. Unless you want to blow some cash on getting a \u2018dick bidet\u2018, Complex has an extensive guide on how to properly clean your penis (that is, surprisingly, completely safe-for-work) with soap and water. Ladies, we have a guide for the vagina as well. I know talking about genitals in any context can be a bit confronting, but it\u2019s a important health topic that needs to be addressed. The final word here is to wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet. You don\u2019t have to go overboard with industrial-strength antibacterial soap. Here\u2019s advice from the Victorian Government\u2019s Better Health Channel on how to wash your hands properly:  \u000aAn idea at home: give each family member their own towel and wash the towels often. Happy washing. Got your own question you want to put to Lifehacker? Send it using our contact form. "more likely to get your hands dirty from the toilet paper, the toilet seat and the flush button or handle." Don't need toilet paper when peeing\u000aDon't touch the toilet seat when peeing, that's what a urinal is for\u000aDon't touch the flush button as the urinal is auto flush\u000aOnly handle touched is the one on the way out. And so if all that is the case and you wash yourself properly in the shower each morning, do you need to wash your hands after taking a piss? In theory this will work the first time, but then your junk goes back in your jocks and whatever remnants there are (and no, shaking alone won't remove it all) will transfer to the cloth, which transfers to the rest of your junk, which you then touch next time you go take a piss. So unless you take a shower in between pissing, you will definitely get piss germs on your hands. So the people that just rinse their hands under water after a wee, is that pointless? Every time I see someone do this I get slightly pissed because that's the person you'll see in the office kitchen with their d^*k scented hands all over the coffee, tea and or kitchen utensils. That said, all the more reason not to use communal tea bags, etc. And a waste of water. Nothing like the transferred smell of piss on a cup or your phone, hmmm so zesty.

VToday, Apple announced the iPhone 7. It doesn\u2019t have a headphone jack. In a few years, you won\u2019t care. There are a lot of reasons why you might be annoyed about this right now. You (almost certainly) already own a pair of headphones. Apple deleted the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 despite it being no thinner than the iPhone 6s. You\u2019ll need to use the included 3.5mm-to-Lightning adapter with your existing headphones or any new headphones that you buy. I can see plenty of people being a bit annoyed at that.  But if you\u2019re making an omelette, you have to break some preconceived notions of how consumer technology hardware evolves. Things don\u2019t stay the same way forever. On that note, a few quick points. The 3.5mm mini-phono jack is old \u2014 more than a hundred years old. At the unveiling of the Lightning connector, four years ago, Apple made the point very clearly that it could carry digital audio, and that it would be in the future. Apple isn\u2019t even the first to try and kill off the headphone jack, either: various Oppo Android phones like the R5 have done away with it and avoided criticism. Wireless headphones aren\u2019t new either, guys. They\u2019ve been around for years. And guess what? If anyone tries to tell you that wireless audio sounds crap, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Maybe back in the dark old days of Bluetooth 1.0, but not any more. I challenge any of you listening to music on an iPhone to tell the difference between your streaming Apple Music tracks through a pair of wired headphones and a pair of wireless ones. And there\u2019s an adapter in the box. You can just stick that on your existing headphones and use them as normal and carry them around with you just like normal. Seriously, this is so not a big deal.  All of these reasons aren\u2019t particularly important, though. What it boils down to is the fact that Apple is allowed to kill the headphone jack, if it wants to. It\u2019s allowed to do what it wants, and you\u2019re allowed to vote with your wallet and not buy the iPhone 7 when it launches.  What it does do is give Apple a reason \u2014 no matter how silly that reason is \u2014 to do something crazy, and invent something awesome. That awesome, crazy thing is AirPods. Tiny earbuds that you stick in your ears, that have enough charge to last for hours, that have integrated microphones and voice-activated controls, and that have their own carry case that charges them for you to use again? That\u2019s really cool. You have to admit that.  In a few years, wired headphones will still be around. But wireless headphones \u2014 with tiny, efficient integrated batteries, and integrated microphones, and integrated everything \u2014 will be so much more common, and more advanced, and for that you will have Apple to thank. This is how innovation happens. Y\u2019know what was lame, though? Apple\u2019s reasoning for getting rid of the headphone jack by replacing it with Lightning. It\u2019s not \u201ccourage\u201d. Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller called it \u201cthe courage to move on and do something better for all of us\u201d, but it\u2019s a business decision \u2014 pure and simple.  With Lightning headphones, Apple will quietly lock more users into its ecosystem, if they want to buy an iPhone 7. But there\u2019s a more rational option available to you right now \u2014 and it\u2019s Bluetooth. Embracing wireless headphones now, for the future, that you can use on any phone you want, is the smart thing to do \u2014 smarter than buying a pair of Lightning headphones, that\u2019s for sure. [Apple] Wireless headphones won't take off because - they will get lost, or misplaced for long inconvenient periods of time even more easily than regular headphones\u000a- batteries yuk\u000a- expensive to replace\u000a- the "problem" they fix (a cable from phone to headphones) is not much of a problem I think the problem lies with you.... I have had a pair of power beats for over a year now. - never lost them\u000a- 12 hours listening time\u000a- Yes, expensive but you get what you pay for\u000a- Cables are a problem, every tech company in the world is getting rid of cables for everything. Going to the gym with wired headphones is a pain in the arse. Since going wireless I feel free with no tangles, hooks or the like that ends up with a phone on the floor. as for Campbell's opinion piece, it took a lot of balls to remove the jack, so courage was a factor. As form factors evolve there will be no place for it. If their plan was to lock you in they would not have provided the converter. Even if they are locking you in, its a very good ecosystem, most people are already locked in. I understand Gizmodo's silent hate for Apple, Giz pooped the nest and no longer gets invited to launch so they are sour and write more opinion then actual journalistic information pieces. The media has gone backwards at a rate of knots in the last 10 years. Mate. A few points that I'd like to address! On both sides of the argument, for and against. Gizmodo US actually got invited to the iPhone 7 launch this year. Gizmodo Australia has been invited for the last three years before that. We don't have any 'silent hate' for Apple! The form factor hasn't actually evolved -- it's the same thickness as the previous iPhone. Which doesn't make for a very good reason to delete the jack. I genuinely don't know what you think we're sour about? Especially when you're making sweeping statements about "the media"... You're comparing your bluetooth headphones to the wireless Airpods which don't even have a cable connecting each other. What Molaram is pointing out is that 2 smaller devices with no cable are much more likely to get lost rather than a pair which are joined. They are also far more restricted in battery life and are very expensive for the purpose that Apple has designed them for. I too, have used many wireless headsets & perhaps you may not sweat as much as myself at the gym but i've found all of mine to fall out of my ears almost as soon as my ear gets sweat anywhere near it. If i go for a jog with Airpods then rather than one dislodging and falling on my shoulder tethered to the other, it will instead fall to the floor & risk breaking. I'm excited for the fact that ditching the 3.5mm jack means that the bluetooth earphones market will be driven to innovate further & improve but at this stage the new apple Airbuds are only going to be troublesome. You sound like the people that told the Wright brothers that flying is impossible or that the world only need 5 computers "What it does do is give Apple a reason \u2014 no matter how silly that reason is \u2014 to do something crazy, and invent something awesome. That awesome, crazy thing is AirPods. Tiny earbuds that you stick in your ears, that have enough charge to last for hours, that have integrated microphones and voice-activated controls, and that have their own carry case that charges them for you to use again? That\u2019s really cool. You have to admit that."  It's not really "inventing" anything if it literally does everything the Samsung Gear IconX has been doing for a few months now... It's not innovation either if wireless earbuds have been on the market for years. Its what they do, proximity sensors, tapping to control playback, make calls and siri - autopairing, with all icloud devices (pair with your phone, go home and they already work with your iPad - bit like wi-fi networks, log in with your phone and your iPad already knows how to log in when it comes in range etc). Motion sensors that know when you are talking all the little things that make them an excellent minimum standard for wireless head phones. You wait - in three years you'll be embarrassed to be seen using a wire. mark my words. This happens evey time a shift in technology is forced upon us, and its just fine. I've been using wireless headphones with my Sammy for years. They Auto connect and I can make calls with them. Only difference is mine cost me 30 dollars four years ago. The AirPods are decent enough, lots of nice tweaks to them as you say. I wouldn't have said groundbreaking, but if Apple had just released those (and even the lightning EarPods) without touching the headphone jack, then they'd be getting nothing but positive press. But "embarrassed to be seen using a wire"? Just like how wireless charging has meant wired chargers are now social death, or ubiquitous WiFi meant USB & ethernet cables are trés démodé, or how 4G broadband has taken over the NBN, or... Wireless is a compromise. You lose the inconvenient wire, and now you have fiddlier, more expensive headphones that have to be recharged regularly. If you're fine with that, great, but kindly don't force it on the rest of us. Not to mention various other brands that have been utilizing this technology and making single wireless earbuds for even longer than samsung's brand now :/\u000aGotta love how Apple always tries to claim they're inventing new stuff but in reality thier tech is far behind.... Yeah, I am aware that there have been other wireless headphones and earbuds but the samsung ones have all of the same features (charging case, voice gestures) as these and it's just surprising that a technology focused website isn't able to be more critical of something that is not "groundbreaking" at all. I would have even let it pass for "re-invent" as other sites have used.  It just seems like more of an opinion piece and less reporting when similar technology that exists is completely ignored. Really? And those 'awesome' airpods being totally incompatible with any non apple product will be useless if you ever leave apple. I'm pretty sure wireless headphones have taken off. There are hundreds available on the marketplace & I see plenty of wireless headphones on my commute to & from work.\u000aI myself own a pair (Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 2.0) & absolutely love them.\u000aBattery Life is not an issue (I get roughly 25 hours a charge & if that's not enough, I can use the cable). They pair easily & connect automatically to the last devices I've used (phone & two laptops).\u000aCost of anything good will be expensive to replace, but if you lose them, that's your problem. Look after your stuff.\u000aYou sound like one of those negative people who moan about things they've never used before What the article ignores is how to use your own expensive earphones via the adapter AND charge at the same time? Or plug into the aux socket in my car whilst charging? I often use Google to navigate and use the aux socket to listen music at the same time, whilst charging of course. With this phone my battery would be dead in no time. Explain to me again how this is a ground-breaking innovation?  Bluetooth 1.0 has been dead for a long time, so I'm not sure the point of the comparison. Suggest you try googling "wireless earbuds -apple" There's hundreds if not thousands of products that give you wireless bluetooth joined by a cable, but if you want tiny little earbuds with no joining hardware you've still got plenty to choose from such as: Motorola Verve One\u000aSamsung Gear IconX\u000aAlto\u000aRowkin the list goes on & on. This is, once again, a small iteration on existing work. Yes and completely incompatible with any existing wireless standard in the marketplace. It's not just headphones that use the 3.5mm jack, anyone who doesn't have bluetooth in their car or home audio system also will feel the lack of 3.5mm jack as a burn. Especially considering in those applications the phone is most likely going to be plugged into a power source (a long drive from Melbourne to Sydney playing music the entire way and GPS if needed will drain the battery like nothing!  Any news on an adapter that will allow 3.5mm and lighting for charge+audio out? 3rd party job maybe? Apple can do what they want, just getting tired of the tech press (not all) hailing it as the second coming. It isn't like the floppy drive they got rid of from the mac's before most PC manufacturers did, that was indeed a relic that served no real purpose to the majority of users, where as the 3.5mm jack is still in high use. FYI, I have a mixture of bluetooth and cabled headphones. I prefer the cabled phone for quality/ease of use but a do like the cordless approach and am eagerly awaiting the Kanoa's to properly ship as I think they will be a better product that the apple earpods or anything by beats... Plus these things look ridiculous: http://imgur.com/JCLJnQu \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 11:00 am								 haha! is that a toothbrush head? The "other" things they do are pretty speccy, but at the potential cost of battery life?  Not worth it...  How do these only last five hours??  Especially for the price.   I have a friend (WARNING: ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE INCOMING) who is really into music, and recently bought what he says are quality wireless headphones; that last 13 hours.   And they were sub-$200, just like these (not 100% on the Aussie price but I believe they will be USD 160?). [Braces self]\u000aThe 3.5mm mini-phono jack is oldSo is the wheel, but I don't see anyone rushing to reinvent that.\u000aIf anyone tries to tell you that wireless audio sounds crap, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.Sorry, that is so off-base. Standard Bluetooth audio is definitely crap, and it's not hard to spot - the high frequencies are just gone, and there's very obvious latency introduced (kills lipsync with video). But it doesn't have to. A2DP allows other codecs, including aptX (which gives high-quality, low-latency sound) and AAC (which is already supported by iOS). All you need is headphones that support the same codecs as your phone, not just the baseline SBC. And there\u2019s an adapter in the box...Seriously, this is so not a big deal.Well, except that a) you now have another fiddly item to carry around and not lose, and b) it blocks your only charging port!! Good luck on that next long flight. Sure, Apple's allowed to do what it likes, and if the issue turns out to be important enough to people then Apple can live with their marketshare declining (faster). That's Apple's call, and if your needs are still met by what they offer, then that's great (sincerely). I'm only thankful that we have excellent alternatives too. But "you will have Apple to thank" for wireless headphone improvements? Really? Which bit is the innovation here, the removal of a perfectly good, effective, and universally compatible alternative? the release of yet another pair of wireless earbuds, just like the all the others? or is it the improved sound quality, like all these headphones have too? I'm not seeing Apple's contribution here, only people defending a decision that does nothing except harm their customers' choices. I have a pair of Sennheiser headphones I purchased 20 years ago, the battery life on them has been great, 20 years on I still don't need to replace or charge anything ;-)\u000aJust because Apple introduces something doesn't mean it is better than what already exists. I really have to disagree with you on this one Campbell.\u000aNone of those things that you mentioned with the Airpods are new.\u000aAll of them have been seen on other headphones.\u000aAnd as you yourself have pointed out it seems pointless to get rid of the port and yet keep the same phone design.\u000aAlso, I find with wireless headphones interference is a very big problem. Walking down the street my wireless ones can become virtually un-usable.\u000aMy wired ones I can use at anytime, anywhere for any length of time and don't have to worry about them being charged. For me personally there are a lot of reasons why wired heaphones are better. Campbell, good on you for writing your piece. you're always going to get mixed opinions. I work at a tech distributor and have on my desk at the moment a pair of ear buds with their own charging case that look infinitely better than these Airpods.  Cheaper too. Good on Apple for trying but I'm calling for #uglyheadphonegate. IMO, understanding there will be some fall out, Apple may have made the call to remove the jack on the 7 (irrespective of no change of thickness), to focus any angst that the change brings, away from the next "major" redesigned iPhone 8. I'd imagine that's where there will be a physical advantage to have it gone (internal and external). The part I absolutely agree on: in a few years not a single person will be complaining about the lack of a headphone jack (like floppy disks, CDs, lightning cables etc before it). But for now, people will be SALTY AS HELL. The in-car aux argument is a big one for me, personally. I'm not a big fan of how Apple are doing everything they can to be proprietary with accessories that are non compatible with non-Apple devices. I get it, but I'm not a fan. It also means that headphone manufacturers have a tougher task - do they make USB-C headphones or Lightning? Or ONLY wireless? Lots of questions over the next few years while the audio industry figures things out after the iPhone 7. OMG so revolutionary of Apple http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-iconx/ Everything apple has plus 4Gb internal memory for offline music........ Bluetooth headphones are great and small earbud ones are the way I like to go... But honestly until they last for 12hrs plus they will never become my main headphones Windows CE phones tried this years ago and failed miserably, Apple aren't even being that brave they are just copying an idea that was around years ago and never took off

V\u201cSo. How\u2019s the wedding planning coming along?\u201d If you\u2019re getting married, prepare to answer this question at least once a week. And \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cfine\u201d won\u2019t do. People want answers. How will you transport the cake? What kind of flowers will you get? Is your DJ going to play my favourite song? If any of this sounds unpleasant, allow me to offer an alternative: Elope.\u000a\u000aIllustration by Angelica Alzona. When my fiance and I got engaged, a few people joked that we should just elope. I wish we had taken them a little more seriously, so let me present my case to anyone out there who may be considering it. Some people know exactly what they want from their wedding. They have pictured it for years, they have every detail planned, and they know how to get started. Before getting engaged, I never gave much thought to a wedding. Why would I? I don\u2019t like throwing parties, I suck at planning them and I get nervous when the spotlight is on me. If that sounds familiar at all, wedding planning might not be a fun process for you. Most of us already struggle with time and stress. We\u2019re all busy. We all have packed schedules. As busy as you are, imagine adding more work to your schedule every week: Call a caterer, book transportation, find a DJ. For some people, these extra tasks are welcome and fun. If you\u2019re not a wedding person, they\u2019re probably just going to stress you out. Plus, you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s busy. Your friends and family are, too, and as much as they offer to help in the beginning, they might not be there as much as you\u2019d like them to be, and that\u2019s stressful, too. Everyone reminds you that all the planning is worth it because it\u2019s your special day. That\u2019s sweet, but let\u2019s be honest: A wedding is for a bunch of other people, too, which is why they\u2019re so damn expensive. If this is truly a day for you and your fiance, and neither of you are wedding people, eloping just seems like a better, more romantic option. And then there\u2019s the money. The average wedding costs something like $36,200, and can be a lot higher depending on your venue. Sure, there are ways to cut costs, but even frugal weddings are expensive. We\u2019re spending $19,500, and sure, people spend a lot more than that, but however you want to look at it, $19,500 is a hell of a lot of money to spend on a single day. The worst part about spending that much is that your guests will almost certainly judge, criticise or complain about every part of it. Unlike any other party, people seem to think every aspect of a wedding is up for review. To be fair, I\u2019ve done it, too. It just seems to be a natural part of wedding culture. I\u2019ve definitely said, \u201cthe party was fun, but the food could have been better,\u201d about a wedding before. Meanwhile, the couple spent thousands of dollars and a fair amount of time on their guests, and I\u2019m rating the food like I\u2019m Jonathan Gold. After a while of this, you start to get resentful, and that makes things even more stressful. Worse than that, many people don\u2019t even like going to weddings. Jokes you once laughed along with, like this one, start to annoy you: Getting married this Saturday? Big wedding? Congrats! You just ruined your friends and family's weekend! \u2014 Jenny Johnson (@JennyJohnsonHi5) June 29, 2016  You can\u2019t help but feel annoyed when people have no idea how much time, effort and money it takes to make the experience as enjoyable as possible for your guests. And when those guests start to complain, you\u2019ll really wish you would have just eloped. Before I started planning, a married friend warned me that friends and family would have their input about what\u2019s appropriate and inappropriate for a wedding. \u201cNah, my people aren\u2019t like that,\u201d I said. I was wrong. I\u2019ve had to address everything from why we\u2019re not having the wedding in a church to why we\u2019re decorating with succulents. Especially if tradition isn\u2019t a priority for you, be prepared to spend a lot of time scratching your head over wedding rules when you plan. A few etiquette issues I\u2019ve had to address and research: As a nontraditional person (who is getting married \u2014 the irony is not lost on me), none of these things matter to me, but they mattered to other people. If you\u2019re not prepared to follow the rules, be prepared to explain why you choose to buck them. When most people think of eloping, they think of running to Vegas for a drive-through, Elvis-themed wedding. That\u2019s one way to go about it, but you don\u2019t have to run off if you don\u2019t want to. It might just be the two of you, or you might choose to invite your family or a couple of friends. The choice is yours. I knew a couple who eloped and simply called a few friends the same day to see if they wanted to join. It\u2019s a risky move, and some people might be annoyed with you, but that goes for eloping in general, so you may consider it par for the course. It\u2019s worth noting that, you will need two other witnesses aside from the celebrant. These witnesses will need to sign your licence in order to validate it. Beyond your guest list, here\u2019s how the process works. The fun part: Choosing where you want to elope. Of course, there\u2019s always your local Registry Office, but if you\u2019re looking for something different, your options abound. Lonely Planet has a fun list of places to elope, and you obviously want to consider your budget and schedule, but that goes for travel in general. Depending on who you want to be there, you might consider a central, affordable location for others. Also, some countries like Australia still don\u2019t recognise same-sex marriages (or they even outrightly ban it), so you want to know the local laws before you buy your tickets. You can look up LGBT rights for different countries at Travel.state.gov. Keep in mind that as Australia doesn\u2019t recognise same-sex marriages, if you enter such a marriage it won\u2019t be recognised when you return. Australia will only recognise a marriage that took place overseas where it was a valid marriage in that country, and would be considered valid under Australian law had it taken place in Australia. Even when you elope, you need someone to officiate your wedding. This could be a celebrant at your local Registry Office, or a religious celebrant if you get married in a church or a chapel, or a friend or family member. You could also just find a celebrant online. If you want a friend to conduct your ceremony, they will have to become a celebrant. Becoming a celebrant requires the completion of a Certificate IV in Celebrancy, the payment of a $600 fee and an annual registration charge of $250.  You need to complete a Notice of Intended Marriage and give it to your celebrant no less than one month and no more than 18 months prior to your elopement. (The one month period may be shortened in certain circumstances by a prescribed authority.) The celebrant can help you complete the form.  You will also need to provide the celebrant with evidence of your identity, date and place of birth, and the termination of any prior marriages. Your celebrant might ask you to sign a statutory declaration confirming these facts. Your marriage celebrant will provide you with the marriage certificate on the day of your wedding. You, your partner, your celebrant and your two witnesses will need to sign three marriage certificates, one of which you will keep as proof of your marriage. If you plan to elope in another state or overseas, research how the process works for that particular destination. Budget Travel explains: \u000aBefore you even commit to the location for your elopement/honeymoon, talk to the convention and visitors bureau to research the hoops you have to jump through to obtain a marriage licence there. Some locales, though popular, have restrictions like waiting periods or witness minimums that could hamper your ideal ceremony. For example: \u201cIn St. Lucia, they have very strict rules,\u201d says Shawn Rabideau, founder of Shawn Rabideau Events & Design in New York City. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to send all the paperwork in, and the resort sort of helps you with that \u2014 they bring it down to the local city office \u2014 but you really need to follow the rules. Otherwise you could find out \u2014 and this has happened \u2014 people have found out they weren\u2019t even legally married.\u201d\u000a This is good advice in general, but especially if you\u2019re eloping somewhere far from home. Finally, after you read your vows and the ceremony is over, the celebrant must then register the certificate with the Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages within 14 days. They must register it in the state or territory in which it took place. If you were married overseas, you cannot register your marriage in Australia, so look after your marriage certificate. Once in Australia, it is all the evidence that your marriage occurred. As attractive as eloping sounds to me right now, a wedding can be fun, too. It\u2019s one of the few times in life where almost everyone you love and care about is in a room together. And best of all, those people get to witness an important, beautiful milestone in your life. As stressful as all of it can be, the older you get, the fewer of those moments you have, so you might as well enjoy them, whichever route you take. If your not into big celebrations/parties, ignore everyone else and Elope, being the first wedding in each family our wedding spiraled into and expensive farce with both families inviting rellies that we hadn't seen for over a decade along to eat and drink at our expense as well as the added stress of it all, its not worth it for other peoples enjoyment.  Now if we are asked for advice on planing a wedding our first answer is ignore everyone else and ELOPE.... My parents eloped,\u000aAnd begat me.\u000aIf they did as were told.\u000aI would not be.

VResearchers from Murdoch University\u2019s Cetacean Research Unit (MUCRU) have recorded extraordinary video footage of a rare white southern right whale calf off the coast of Western Australia. The drone footage was taken off Augusta in south west Australia by a research project using a ground-breaking approach to help unlock some of the mysteries surrounding the whales.  The research team (Murdoch University researchers Dr. Fredrik Christiansen and Prof. Lars Bejder, together with Prof. Peter T. Madsen, from Aarhus University in Denmark) used a suite of innovative technologies including suction cup tags and drones to assess fine-scale movements, acoustic communications, ambient noise, calf suckling rates and body condition of southern right whales.  In doing so, Professor Bejder said the team hoped to better understand the behaviours of the whales on their breeding and calving grounds, and how human activities may influence behavioural patterns, including suckling rates of calves. \u201cLittle is known about the fine-scale movements and habitat-use of southern right whales on their breeding and calving grounds in Australia \u2013 many of which are slated for development activity, including associated increases in shipping, marine tourism and recreational activity,\u201d said Professor Bejder. \u201cFurthermore, we need to know more about the ambient ocean noise in these regions and the extent to which southern right whales will be exposed to increased noise derived from human undertakings.\u201d Drones were flown over the whales and their calves, gathering valuable video footage and images which enables the researchers to measure and assess their body size and health. \u201cDrones are allowing us to non-invasively measure the size and body condition of free living southern right whales, which in turn allows us to investigate important aspects of their health and reproduction, including the growth rate of calves in relation to the condition of their mothers,\u201d said Dr Christiansen. By approaching the whales slowly in a small vessel and using hand-held poles, digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) were attached to seven whales in a manner that minimizes the potential for disturbance. The DTAGS were attached to whales for periods of up to 24 hours, sending back valuable data of the whales\u2019 movement in three dimensions, vocal behaviour, calf suckling rates and the acoustic environment at 800 samples per second. \u201cThe DTAG measures and records the depth and temperature of the water, and the swimming orientation in three-dimensions of the tagged animal. The tag also recorded sound, which is sufficient for measuring sounds both made by boats and heard by the whales,\u201d added Professor Bejder. The DTAG also contains a VHF transmitter that is used to follow the tagged whale whenever it is at the surface and to aid in tag retrieval. A programmable release mechanism allows tags to release at a predetermined time. The information acquired will aid management agencies at a federal and state level in developing conservation strategies to protect southern right whales in areas of proposed coastal development and increasing human activities. All research activities were permitted by the WA Department of Parks and Wildlife and Murdoch University Animal Ethics Committee and all drone operations were conducted in accordance with CASA regulations.

V Video: Raising children is a lot of work, so who can blame parents that look for tips and tricks to make it all a little easier? Sadly, not all life hacks are as useful as they seem. Here\u2019s what happens when 25 of the most popular parenting hacks are attempted.\u000a\u000aIn this video from the Mental Floss YouTube channel, host John Green is back to see which life hacks are actually worth a parent\u2019s time. Some work pretty well, like mess-free finger painting using a plastic bag, storing children\u2019s puzzles in a laundry bag so no pieces get lost, filling a plastic bag with frozen marshmallows for a DIY ice pack and reversing a crazy straw to make it so a kid can\u2019t pull it out of the cup. Others fail miserably and hysterically, like using WD-40 to remove crayon stains from clothes, using a cookie cutter as a stencil for custom birthday cakes, filling water balloons with a pump soap dispenser and using a coffee creamer container as snack storage. Of course, you can probably get by without most of these tips as long as you know the important stuff. 25 Parenting Life Hacks [YouTube] I really enjoy Mental Floss. :)

VOn paper, the idea of the original April O\u2019Neil (Judith Hoag) meeting the new one (Megan Fox) in the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows movie seems clever and fun. But now that the scene itself is online, you can easily see why deleting it was absolutely the right decision.\u000a\u000aMegan Fox as April O\u2019Neil in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. Image: Jessica Miglio/Paramount Here\u2019s the scene:  This is a great example of why I consider myself a fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. Most movies would have included the scene purely for nostalgia\u2019s sake, but as you can see, there\u2019s nothing to it. Including it would have unnecessarily bogged things down, and the film wisely avoided it, opting to keep the pace both fast and exciting. So, even though it was probably difficult to shoot and Hoag would have been a nice addition to the movie, director David Green wisely relegated the scene to the Blu-ray, which hits stores September 15. I\u2019m glad I finally got to see it, but I\u2019m even more glad that I had to wait to see it instead of it being part of the film. [Yahoo Movies] Might be just me, but Judith Hoag looks hotter now than when she was younger! Should have deleted the entire film. Damn, you beat me to it. It was truly horrible.

VDoctors have this nasty habit of asking a lot of questions, many of which make us uncomfortable or self-conscious. So we bluff. A lot. Here are 10 typical lies we tell our doctors, and why these seemingly innocuous fibs are hazardous to our health.\u000a Illustration: Angelica Alzona/Gizmodo No, you\u2019re not.

But now, you\u2019re not just skipping out on prescribed treatment, you\u2019ve given your doctor a dose of misinformation which could result in further adverse effects. \u201cI need to know whether the patient is taking the meds. If they aren\u2019t, and I assume the drug isn\u2019t working, it may cause me to switch to a different second choice med,\u201d Dr. David B. Agus, the Director of the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine, told Gizmodo. A doctor might also unnecessarily adjust your dosage, since your current one (the one you\u2019re not actually taking) isn\u2019t apparently having its intended effect. Dosage boosts come with their own set of consequences, such as increased heart rate, dizziness, and fatigue. So now you\u2019re actually undermining your health, which is the opposite outcome of why you went to the doctor in the first place. Often, the doctor can tell if you\u2019re not taking specific medications \u2014 if you show up with elevated blood pressure, or your blood tests indicate high cholesterol. Ultimately, however, it\u2019s really on you. \u201cBe honest about the meds you are taking or not taking,\u201d Agus says, \u201cand then together we can make the right decisions.\u201d Oh, really? This seemingly minor omission could seriously derail your health. As Agus explains, when his patients don\u2019t tell him about all of the medications they\u2019re taking, he may miss an important interaction or potential side effect. This includes prescription drugs like blood-thinners, antibiotics, antidepressants, and heart medications, as well as supplements and over-the-counter drugs, such as aspirin, minerals, amino acids, botanicals, and vitamins. \u201cSupplements are drugs and need to be treated as such,\u201d he told Gizmodo. \u201cThey should be listed on a patient\u2019s record of their medications.\u201d The nature of drug-on-drug reactions depend on the particular mixture and the unique physiology of the patient, but some drugs pack a bigger punch than others. \u201cThese may be painkillers, benzodiazepines, and so on,\u201d Dr. Gail Saltz, an associate professor of psychiatry at The New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornel School of Medicine, told Gizmodo. She says it\u2019s unfortunate when people lie to their doctor about addictive medications they\u2019re taking, or have been prescribed by another doctor. \u201cThese medications interact with others and can have an additive effect, which can be dangerous.\u201d Problematic drug-on-drug interactions can include a dangerous drop in blood pressure, a fast-paced irregular heart beat, a build-up of toxins that damage the liver, and less serious symptoms such as nausea, upset stomach, and headache. Patients may lie, says Saltz, because they want more of these medications, or because they feel embarrassed. They may also fail to tell their doctor that they are on antidepressants because they feel uncomfortable sharing that psychiatric treatment information with another doctor, or feel that it\u2019s not important. \u201cDrug interactions make it important for your doctor to know.\u201d says Saltz, \u201cA diagnosis of depression or anxiety is also important to know because some medications can, as a side effect, cause depression or anxiety \u2014 and particularly in someone who has already been experiencing that.\u201d A patient comes in for surgery and the anesthesiologists asks, \u201cWhen was the last time you had anything to eat or drink?\u201d The patient responds, \u201cOh doc, I haven\u2019t had anything all day.\u201d It may sound like a harmless fib, but according to Fahan Khan, assistant professor of anesthesiology at NYU Langone Medical Center, it could result in disaster. \u201cIt is very important for patients to be honest about that last oral intake of food or drink as it can have significant consequences with regards to their anesthetic plan,\u201d he told Gizmodo. \u201cPatients presenting for elective surgery are assumed to have an empty stomach, because they are prepped to do so.\u201d Trouble is, when a patient is put to sleep via anesthesia, their lower esophageal sphincter (the valve that connects the esophagus to the stomach) relaxes. During this period of relaxation, says Khan, food contents from the stomach can dangerously regurgitate up into the patient\u2019s mouth and snake their way into the patient\u2019s trachea (windpipe) on their way to the lungs. Once in the lungs, this regurgitated acidic food material can start to cause inflammation and may even lead to the development of a pneumonia. \u201cLying to your anesthesiologist about the last time you had anything to eat prior to surgery can have devastating consequences and in a worst case scenario can land you in the ICU,\u201d he says. Many of us are guilty of this one. Dr. Harriet Hall, editor of Science Based Medicine, says our failure to tell the truth about alcohol consumption is counterproductive. \u201cUnderreporting the amount of alcohol you drink will only delay diagnosis and treatment,\u201d she told Gizmodo. Health experts say that you shouldn\u2019t have more than two-three drinks a day (10-15 per week), adding that\u2019s ok to indulge on special occasions. Health problems can arise when we exceed these limits, including raised blood pressure, abnormal blood-test results, and digestive issues. So if you lie to your doctor about your alcohol intake, and you exhibit these symptoms, you\u2019re potentially leading your doctor down the garden path. What\u2019s more, alcohol \u2014 like any other drug \u2014 may be influencing the effectiveness of medications you\u2019re taking, and your doctor needs to know. For those with a more serious alcohol issue, this is a kind of lie that could actually kill them, according Dr. David Juurlink from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. \u201cI\u2019m referring specifically to patients who are admitted to hospital, and who subsequently develop alcohol withdrawal,\u201d he told Gizmodo. \u201cIt\u2019s a potentially lethal \u2014 and sometimes hard to diagnose \u2014 disorder.\u201d In a hospital, if doctors have been truthfully told about a patient\u2019s alcohol history, they know to watch for withdrawal and treat it accordingly. But if they\u2019re not told or misled about a patient\u2019s alcohol consumption, and the patient goes into withdrawal, health practitioners often look for other disorders that can cause similar findings (e.g. fever, agitation, confusion, etc.), and may forgo what can be lifesaving treatment for alcohol withdrawal. \u201cSeriously, people shouldn\u2019t worry about being judged by their doctors,\u201d says Juurlink. \u201cPlenty of doctors drink more alcohol than they should.\u201d Around 13 per cent of smokers keep their habit a secret from their doctors. Taken as a whole, that means about six million smokers in the United States are withholding this very important information. \u201cWhen I ask them if they\u2019re a smoker they often say they\u2019re an ex-smoker,\u201d says Dave Hepburn, a general practitioner in Victoria, British Columbia. \u201cWhen I ask how long, some will admit five days or similar.\u201d Needless to say, that does not make one an ex-smoker, particularly if that person has been smoking regularly for years. People are afraid to tell their doctors the truth because of the social stigma surrounding cigarette use, and because they\u2019re afraid to admit to themselves that they\u2019re engaging in an extremely risky health habit. What\u2019s more, patients may be hiding their habit from their families (who often share a GP) or their employers. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to tell the truth. If your doctor knows you smoke, they can recommend further screenings and evaluations, and assign a more stringent schedule of check-ups to catch smoking-related diseases, such as cancer, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and heart disease. It\u2019s also important to remember that your doctor can help you kick the habit before it\u2019s too late. \u201cSmoking is one of the most important lifestyle changes that can be made that affects health dramatically in many areas ranging from stroke and heart attack to cancers of all types,\u201d Hepburn told Gizmodo. Given that most recreational drugs are illegal, we\u2019re obviously uncomfortable about sharing these habits with our doctors. Dr. Ramin Manshadi, an Associate Clinical Professor at UC Davis, feels that the vast majority of people who take recreational drugs lie to their doctors about it, yet the truth often shows up in their urine. Failure to disclose the drugs we\u2019re taking, especially hard drugs, can seriously impede a doctor\u2019s ability to diagnosis a health condition. Marijuana, an increasingly socially and legally acceptable recreational drug, can interfere with other drugs, such as antidepressants, aspirin, blood thinners (e.g. warfarin and heparin), antiplatlet drugs, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. ibuprofen). It can also affect blood sugar levels and cause low blood pressure. Importantly, if you\u2019re being taken to the hospital for a drug-related reason, or if you\u2019re on some kind of drug when a health emergency happens, you should tell your doctor or the ER so they know exactly how to treat you and save you from something potentially much worse than a bad trip. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to disclose your drug use to your doctors specially if you are having a heart attack,\u201d says Manshadi. \u201cIf a patient is having a heart attack and they have used cocaine for example, then we cannot give them some beneficial meds that we normally give heart attack patients,\u201d adding that the combination \u201ccan cause worsening of heart attack and possibly death.\u201d \u201cIf your cholesterol is up, blood glucose is high, as is your blood pressure, don\u2019t just say you\u2019ve been going through a bad period when your life has been bad for as long as you can remember,\u201d says David Jenkins, professor of Nutritional Sciences and Medicine at the University of Toronto. \u201cYou need help. You need a change in lifestyle. And if that\u2019s not sufficient then you need a change in meds.\u201d Dr. Mullen says that too many patients try to sound perfect for their doctors, but lying about exercise in particular only hurts the patients. \u201cWe all know diabetes and heart disease are major problems in developed countries,\u201d he told Gizmodo. \u201cExercise and diet are the best methods for beating these diseases, so don\u2019t lie about it! Overlooking the daily necessity of nutrition and exercise is a big problem. Be honest and get some helpful tips from your doctor.\u201d A patient may tell their doctor that they\u2019re only taking about 1 to 2 tablets of Tylenol once in a while, but in reality they\u2019re taking about two tablets every four hours around the clock, seven days a week. As Dr. Khan explains, acetaminophen toxicity is real and can be deadly. \u201cDoctors need to know an accurate record of how much over-the-counter acetaminophen a patient is actually taking in order to prescribe them a safe pain management plan,\u201d he says. \u201cSeveral pain medications (i.e. Percocet, Vicodin, Norco, Ultracet) are combination pills that include a strong acting opioid medication in addition to acetaminophen.\u201d Khan says a patient\u2019s liver doesn\u2019t know where all the acetaminophen is coming from, nor does it really care. It\u2019s just trying to figure out a way to metabolize the copious amount of medicine safely and effectively. \u201cThe most recent guidelines for the use of acetaminophen have suggested that no more than 4,000 mg (some even cite 3,000 mg) as the upper daily limit of allowable intake,\u201d says Khan. \u201cSo now if a doctor is under the assumption that a patient is only taking a small amount of over-the-counter acetaminophen on their own, he/she may unknowingly prescribe a combination pain medication \u2014 one that that also contains acetaminophen \u2014 that will put the patient at risk for potentially developing liver failure.\u201d Some of us go to the doctor and under-exaggerate our symptoms in hopes that the doctor won\u2019t find anything wrong with us, or to feed our inflated egos in regards to how much discomfort we can handle. This is obviously a huge no-no. As an example, Dr. Mashadi points to patients who have had stents implanted to treat blockages in their arteries. \u201cThey downplay their symptoms because they do not want to end up getting another stent,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis is dangerous since the sooner we find out there are issues, the better the outcome.\u201d On the other hand, Manshadi says there are patients who have financial hardships and downplay their symptoms so they don\u2019t have to pay their deductibles and/or co-pay. \u201cThis is also dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cThe advice is to always the truth to your doctors. As much as legally possible, I would discount patients that can not afford to pay or refer them to free clinics. Health comes first.\u201d Similarly, Dr. Mullen says he has patients who come in and downplay the amount of aches and pains they\u2019re feeling, saying they keep quiet about neck, shoulder, or low back pain. \u201cUnfortunately, these painful areas may be more problematic than they think,\u201d he says. \u201cMany systemic diseases refer pain to other areas (i.e. referral pain). If it isn\u2019t a referral pain, it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t serious. Regular joint pain should be addressed early and referred to a physical therapist, as pain can increase risk for joint degeneration and replacement later in life.\u201d As Dr. Hall pointed out to Gizmodo, about 40 to 80 per cent of medical information provided by doctors is forgotten immediately, and much of what is remembered is remembered wrong. \u201cGet the doctor to provide written information, read it carefully at home, and prepare questions for the next visit,\u201d she recommends. Clearly, our ability to understand and remember our doctor\u2019s instructions and admonitions is critical to getting better and staying healthy. When we don\u2019t comprehend something our doctor says, we might not take our medications correctly, or we might engage in risky habits if we don\u2019t truly understand the implications of a concussion or an x-ray. We need to stop pretending and nodding our heads in agreement when our doctors start talking gobbledygook. As patients, we\u2019re the non-experts, so we need to check our egos at the door. It\u2019s ok to ask your doctor for clarification. Remember \u2014 that\u2019s their job, and just like you, they want to see your health improve. On the alcohol one, I had a friend of mine end up on an alcohol abuse course in the airforce for correctly reporting his alcohol use while everyone else who drank far more than him lied. Apparently because everyone lies, they scale up the answer. You should never lie to your Dr... Ever. Unless you are trying to score some ADHD meds. Then lie. What lies would you recommend telling in that instance... you know... for educational purposes. >.> Yeah, I wouldn't say "shouldn't" re: illicit drug use, except perhaps in an emergency (which to be fair the article is mainly focussed on). Unless that emergency is based entirely around a need for pain relief first, in which case, delay that disclosure. Many doctors, GPs or in the ER, are judgmental and the quality of your care may well be diminished the MOMENT you confess illicit drug use. This can be as simple as disregarding your input or competency to engage with your care needs, or as extreme as denying you appropriate and much needed pain relief because you're "drug seeking". Drug users cop a lot of bull from the health profession, and simply suggesting people put themselves at risk of extremely discriminatory behaviour without alerting people to the very real risks is hardly responsible - even for a lightweight blog piece like this. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 3:22 pm								 Going to the GP is like a job interview, you are there for a reason. Don't tell them more than you have to in order to achieve your goal. And do your own research. No, You should trust your doctor who has spent years learning to become one, You should instead trust the internet! a source anyone can edit! That homeopathic blog is much more reliable than a doctor Who mentioned homeopathy? And i didn't say doctor, I said GP. GP's follow a set of instructions/procedures and are spread thin across many areas which means they know a little about everything but not a lot about anything.  If you do your own research you can understand a lot of of the process and know more than them on certain subjects that relate to you. You need to be proactive and in charge of your own health. Use the GP as a referrer. He/she refers you to specialists who know a lot about the specific issue that relates to you. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 11:40 pm								 I love it when the doctor examines you and suggests you cut back on cigarettes and alcohol when you dont use either. \u201cLying to your anesthesiologist about the last time you had anything to eat prior to surgery can have devastating consequences and in a worst case scenario can land you in the ICU,\u201d he says. That's putting it gently. Aspiration of stomach contents could lead to your death on the operating table, or later in ICU from aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis. And lying to your anaesthetist about your drug and alcohol habits could lead to significant under-dosing of your anaesthetic drugs. In other words, you might be awake during surgery. Pot heads take a lot of drugs to go (and stay) asleep. Dr Stu, FANZCA

V\u000aTaking place from June 8-12 in San Francisco, Apple\u2019s WWDC sees its developer community come together to learn about the future of iOS and OS X. WWDC features more than 100 technical sessions, over 1,000 Apple engineers,  hands-on labs, and the Apple Design Awards. Here are a few things you can expect from the developers conference. 1.  iOS 9 The previous iOS 8 was a monster at 2 GBs. iOS9 promises faster operations, with a smaller upload.  Apple has reportedly found a way to get the new version on phones without it taking so much space. With iOS9, Apple also promises better notifications, working with Calendar, Contacts and Passbook to supposedly provide much better informed updates to your day and interests. Indeed it is, many believe, Apple\u2019s attempt to take on Google Now, a popular AI feature of the Google app (available on iOS but more efficient on Android phones) to suggest movie listings, news articles and other updates based on your interests. 2. A new OS X 10.11 \u2018Mojave\u2019 Developers are also expecting that Apple will release an upgrade to OSX, which Yahoo states will be code named \u201cMojave.\u201d Gizmodo reports that it will have a control centre similar to iOS as well as improved security features and some enhancements.  Apparently a new system font is rumoured to be replacing the current Helvetica Neue \u2013 apparently it looks a little like Arial and is said to read better on retina displays! 3. A new digital streaming service According to Yahoo, Apple is \u2013 following its acquisition of Beats Music last year \u2013 working on a new $10-a-month new music streaming service to rival  the likes of Spotify, Pandora and Deezer. Apparently existing Beats Music account holders will be able to use their log-in credentials via iTunes. According to the frequently accurate Apple blog 9to5Mac, Apple\u2019s internal name for the project is Apple Music which makes since Apple boss Tim Cook decided to drop the i prefix with the premiere of the Apple Watch earlier this year. It\u2019s also expected to drop the Beats Music branding too. 4. Revamped iTunes Radio Along with a new streaming music service (see above), Apple is also planning to introduce a revamped version of iTunes Radio. iTunes Radio is designed to complement the new music service, giving people a way to listen to music for free. It may also include more local content and new stations that are created by and hosted by DJs. 5. Apple TV? The invitation for Apple\u2019s WWDC shows an Apple TV device, but reports from Re/Code indicate that the negotiations for content have challenged even Apple\u2019s aggressive distributors. Part of the reason for that delay is Apple\u2019s rumoured desire to want to include live local television in its service. So don\u2019t hold your breath on this one! How to watch the WWDC 2015 keynote livestream without a Mac Officially, the WWDC 2015 keynote livestream can only be viewed by using Apple products, including Macs, iPad or iPhone, as well as on the Apple TV. It\u2019s not available on Windows PCs and Android smartphones and tablets. However, the canny folk at 9to5mac have pointed out that the universal media player software VLC can decode the livestream quite happily. You\u2019ll need to download and install VLC from www.videolan.org/vlc, by going to Media > Open Network Stream and pasting in the URL: http://p.events-delivery.apple.com.edgesuite.net/15pijbnaefvpoijbaefvpihb06/m3u8/atv_mvp.m3u8. Finally just press play Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related). When he\u2019s not writing about the latest developments in the connected home, he\u2019s normally driving his little smart car round town. A passionate swimmer, Chris has his own swimming blog and is a qualified lifeguard.

VCesar Romero\u2019s take on the Joker for the Batman \u201966 TV show is iconic \u2014 but the very obvious moustache he refused to shave for the role, barely obscured with white face paint, is almost as famous as he is. Thankfully, Hot Toys remembered this crucial detail when bringing Romero\u2019s Joker to action figure life.  All images via One Sixth Republic Revealed at a special Batman-themed Hot Toys event in Japan called Batman 100%, the figure joins Hot Toys\u2019 previously released Batman \u201966 Batman and Robin figures. Unsurprisingly for a Hot Toys figure, it looks great \u2014 but seriously, the real joy here is that they have kept Romero\u2019s painted moustache in the head sculpt. It\u2019s hilarious, but speaks to the ridiculous detail these figures have. The delightful-looking upcoming Batman \u201966 animated movie has seemingly erased the moustache from the Joker\u2019s look (presumably because it\u2019s no longer going to be Romero playing the character), so it\u2019s nice to see it live on in action figure form. Any other accessory included \u2014 even the Total Dehydrator! \u2014 is just a bonus on top of this. No details about when he\u2019ll be available have been released yet, but we\u2019ll let you know when there\u2019s more. [One Sixth Republic via Toy News International]

VApple has a new iPhone. It\u2019s more powerful than ever \u2014 the most powerful phone ever. It has longer battery life, and the larger 7 Plus has a unique dual-lens camera. It has no headphone jack. It\u2019s waterproof and dust proof. The home button is brand new. And it runs Apple\u2019s brand new iOS 10 operating system. Here\u2019s everything you need to know. At its September Special Event in San Francisco, Apple introduced the world to the new iPhone 7, running through a list of 10 features that made it unique and magical and other positive adjectives. We can boil that down to a few less for you. The iPhone 7 has the same basic design and layout as the iPhone 6, but makes a few small but significant changes. The chassis, for example, has been redesigned to almost entirely eliminate antenna lines, and integrates the camera bump into the chassis for a smoother, rounder look. Everything looks a little more refined. Oh, and there\u2019s no headphone jack any more. The phone\u2019s home button has been redesigned, abandoning the classic tactile clicking home button for a Force Touch pressure-sensitive circle. Inside the phone, a larger Taptic Engine vibration engine allows different feelings for short and long press and other interactions. The new iPhone is IP67 water and dust resistant, too. And then there\u2019s the new colours. The iPhone 7 will be available in the usual silver, gold and rose gold, but abandons Space Grey for a new matte Black and piano Jet Black finish. That super-glossy Jet Black will only be available in the two higher storage capacities, so you\u2019ll have to open your wallets even more than usual to get one. On the smaller iPhone 7, the redesigned 12-megapixel camera gets a faster f/1.8 lens and optical image stabilisation, with a new six-element lens glass setup and a True Tone LED flash that now has four different LED segments that can flash 50 per cent brighter than the old one. It also supports wide colour gamut photography and RAW image capture. Now, the 7 Plus\u2019 dual-lens camera isn\u2019t unique in that it\u2019s dual lens. The Huawei P9 has that, as does the LG G5. What\u2019s unique about the iPhone 7 is that it mixes features from both those competitors. Like the P9 it has two identical 12-megapixel sensors, one for each lens, giving you shots that look the same from both cameras. Like the G5, you get a wide-angle and a telephoto lens to give you two different creative options. Apple is talking about the iPhone 7 Plus\u2019 potential to zoom between the two lenses, and up to 10x total zoom using the iPhone\u2019s camera. It\u2019s important to realise that you only have two optical zoom settings \u2014 1x, using the 28mm prime lens\u2019 full 12-megapixel sensor, and 2x, using the 56mm prime lens\u2019 full 12-megapixel sensor. Anything else will introduce a bit of digital cropping. Apple\u2019s Retina displays don\u2019t get a resolution bump, but they are 25 per cent brighter than previous phones. That\u2019s a big difference, especially when it comes to outdoor viewing and watching video, both of which can benefit massively from a higher peak brightness level. The new displays \u2014 also identically sized to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus \u2014 support wide colour gamut, which is one of those incredibly important display technologies that nobody really talks about. WCG means a much broader range of colours can be displayed, and that means smoother gradation in the images and icons you see. And like the iPhone 6s, the 7 supports 3D Touch. While Apple and its third-party partners haven\u2019t really given 3D Touch a killer hook yet, we happen to think it\u2019s an incredibly important piece of hardware. In the smartphone world, it\u2019s (almost ironically) like giving Apple a second right-click mouse button where its competitors only have left-click. The iPhone 7 uses a new A10 Fusion system-on-chip processor, which is for the first time a quad-core chip. Integrating two performance cores and two efficiency cores, it\u2019s a similar ARM setup to the one that many Android phones have used for some time now, allowing for a compromise between battery life and outright performance.  Apple says the iPhone 7 is the most powerful smartphone ever, though. While we\u2019ll wait for the Geekbench results to tell us that for a fact, it\u2019s definitely faster than the 6s \u2014 with 50 per cent more graphics power versus the previous A9, which will make higher frame rates possible for visually interesting games. More internal storage as standard, too, is a very nice inclusion. 32GB is now the base level \u2014 thank God! We told you not to buy a 16GB iPhone \u2014 and 128GB and 256GB are the upper-specced variants available. That\u2019s a bunch of storage, and that means a bunch of offline photos and Apple Music downloads without even worrying about an iCloud backup.  The iPhone 7\u2019s speakers are 50 per cent louder than the 6s, and for the first time \u2014 a long, long time coming, too \u2014 in an iPhone are stereo. The iPhone 7 uses the earpiece for that stereo sound with the same downward-firing speaker in the base, also promising a more extensive dynamic range when you\u2019re using them \u2014 but please, don\u2019t use them on the train when I\u2019m around. The battery is improved over last generation, not through a larger capacity but just by the new A10 Fusion chip\u2019s more efficient processing. Apple says the 7 will get two hours more than the 6s \u2014 13 hours of wireless video watching, let\u2019s say \u2014 where the 7 Plus gets one more more than the 6s Plus \u2014 14 hours overall wireless video. And Apple is also keeping up \u2014 for the most part \u2014 with ongoing advances in Wi-Fi and 4G mobile network connectivity, with the iPhone 7 supporting 450Mbps downloads over LTE Category 9 with support for LTE-Advanced. And Voice over LTE and Wi-Fi calling are also both included out of the box, as long as Australia\u2019s carriers get their act together for it.

You certainly can't, if your first post is any indication. BOOM! Thanks you saved everyone the trouble. it not that samsung did all those things first, its that multiple manufacturers did those things first. and the fact you had to write 'in before'..... well, that kinda speaks for itself. Yes, "in before" means that you fully expect the following statements. To expect these speaks very poorly of the expectation indeed. Also you proved my point perfectly. dig up buddy, dig up. http://appleplugs.com/ Anyone saying any of that wouldn't be wrong. So whats the problem? You seem salty, friend. But please, continue. difference between iPhone users and you is we don't go trolling android articles and make jealous comments.. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 5:00 pm								 ok, here's a proper criticism.... The wireless earphones. Brave and innovative? I don't think so. Adapter required. Earpieces (not included) for an additional $200 or so????? pfffft. And they do look shit. With adapter for headphones (wired) you cannot listen to music and charge device at the same time. I really think this might be the i-Phone model that is 'skipped'. I get somewhat excited when a new iphone comes out. That said, im not an apple fanboy, and I havent had an iphone since the iphone4. What im excited about is the fact that even though some of the new features apple announces are not original, that other companies have tried it before, their market presence and popularity brings those features to the greater consciousness of buyers and sooner or later, it will become mainstream and ignite competition from other companies and third party brands. Eg. The air pods have been done before, by samsung and other companies, but now I feel that a lot more are going to try it because apple announced it. Same as a dual focal pt lens camera.. i was kind of disappointed that samsung didnt jump on it, considering how awesome it is on the LG G5. *Meant to be comment not reply*! \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 7:24 am								 for the first time \u2014 a long, long time coming, too \u2014 in an iPhone are stereo. The iPhone 7 uses the earpiece for that stereo sound with the same downward-firing speaker in the base So its not really stereo, its just 2 speakers since at such close proximity you're not going to experience a real stereo split unless you hold the phone upside down and put your nose between the speakers. I agree - who listens to their phone expecting full channel seperation anyhow - plus the tiny drivers always sound like shit. This is a hype driven feature that delivers little real benefit to the user. Yeah but they're TWICE as shit (loud) now :) PS I'm hella keen for the new iphone cause contract is up, just thought that was too good not to write haha. Excellent, now I can hear shitty tinny music twice as much on train trips. Well said!!!!! You do know that one speaker is firing from the. Bottom and the other from the earpiece creating a stereo sound. Not both shooting from the bottom... Ah I see, I misread it as in using the earpods for stereo. Derek: Its not like were actually up in a control tower trying to contact outer space aliens or anything. ...... Hansel: hello ... hello To be fair *every* phone that advertises stereo speakers has this same issue. And honestly, why would you listen to the phone speaker(s) for anything other than phone calls. If you're listening to your music in public respect other people and use headphones. If you're playing music for everyone use a speaker dock. *not an apple specific complaint, applies to every phone. OK so we have more of the same but it goes faster can handle being splashed and has a better camera. Sorry but that is not enough. All Apple has done is catch up with everyone else and even then they are still lagging in key feature areas such as NFC....  Then there's those earbuds, they look incredibly awkward to wear and cost a bomb? Did Apple even bother looking at the competition? There are cheaper and better bluetooth cans with the same functionality already out there. Sorry Apple foisting last years model with cosmetic tweaks and charging a premium really just isnt good enough. You need to change the game and you-k now innovate. Android here I come It's a bit disappointing that the screen didn't get a resolution boost, especially on the little one. A HD ready screen was perfect three generations ago but now it looks pretty poor compared to the average phone. So you're saying that the iPhone 7 still hasn't got a full 1080 screen. Really. Nahhhhhhh, it's 2016 isn't it. Yeah apparently it's still only 750p! http://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_7-8064.php you cannot even see the pixels with the naked eye on the retina. Someone else that's swallowed Apple's marketing; hook, line and sinker. The Retina myth was busted long ago - Apple's maths are based on the fallacy that 20/20 is perfect human vision, which isn't even close to true. And even if you can't see actual pixels, blind Freddy can easily see the improvement that 400ppi gives over 300ppi at typical viewing distances. mate, even up to 400ppi the pixels are still discernible. it's all marketing BS from apple. Really?  This is really a thing? People really worry that their tiny fricken screen is 300 vs 400ppi?\u000aYou guys really need to get out of your house and do something more productive with your life. \u000a									Last edited September 10, 2016 12:09 am								 is resorting to ad hominem the only course of action you have at this point?\u000abecause you're excused. In case you can't tell, I'm saying there is so little difference between a phone that has a 300 or 400ppi screen, that only spec geeks like you and your mate actually care. In fact, I would go as far as saying companies like samsung engage in this practice (unnecessary spec bumps) to deliberately appeal to spec geeks. In a blind test, I would be surprised if 1% of people could tell the difference. Except in this case (which is fast becoming the norm), is the difference between apple's retina (~300dpi) vs other flagships (~500dpi) on the same price bracket, and even cheaper. It's been proven (as the person above has mentioned) that "retina resolution" and 20/20 vision have nothing to do with each other, and pixel dpi is discernible way beyond 300dpi, and that retina was just marketing BS. The general public can actutally tell the difference between the resolutioms with the naked eye. From all your previous apple hate comments ill hazard a a guess you would have been disappointed even if the iphone cured cancer, had a 12 core 16gb RAM soc a 1200pdi 8K screen, DNA authentication and a 2 week battery. I don't hate apple, I just don't understand the hype. That's a big difference. I don't care enough to hate!  PS Your iphone sounds AWESOME! Throw in a headphone socket and I'd buy it...! I want an iPhone to impress me again as I'm almost all Mac now and it would just make life easier, but the fact is this is another boring Apple phone. No headphone jack seals the deal that I'll probably never have an iPhone again. From your comment, Apple could murder children, Side with ISIS and nuke the UK and youd still defend them. But.. will it explode? Damn! beat me too it!!! Maybe, Apple gets their batteries from sammy, in fact gets most of their components from sammy. The charger might. Funny how a  fire causing charger recall that spans across 12 years worth of devices, with the last faulty one being made in 2015, never seems to get mentioned these days. Probably because the brand insist on calling it an "exchange program" not a recall. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 9:20 pm								 They were recalled due to concerns around electric shock, not because they were causing fires. Not to say an electric shock is particularly great either. "Everything you need to know" apparently does not include mentioning that the headphone port has been removed. Surely at least one sentence of this should be in the "design" section, or even "everything else"?\u000aEDIT : This is now in the first paragraph, or perhaps I missed it first time around. \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 9:00 am								 I missed the press release, is there an actual reason they are moving the headphone jack onto the lightning connector? Just seems like another adapter I will have to use.\u000aApart from that all looks pretty "part of the course" bigger battery, better processor, brighter screen ect.... nothing unusual from the average annual release. I do like the idea of much louder speakers though, I currently run a HTC simply because of the fantastic front facing speakers. Pretty sure it was to free up space inside.  Theres already a jack there that can do the job, why repeat when theres no real reason to. The adapter isnt huge, people will get used to plugging into that instead, and not worry about an extra couple of cm's of cord.  In some ways it could be an improvement, because that jack point is where a lot of headphones typically break, and it'll move the weakpoint to the $12 adapter. I've lost a couple of $300 headphones because I've clipped that entry point on a wall, or something like that, so if that stress point is moved to whats easily replacable, thats a win. Not that I plan on getting an iPhone, I'm happy with HTC. To free up space for something new i guess. I was taking this in to consideration the other day when i purchased a new portable device. For me Apple sure do love their proprietary connectors. Carrying a pocket full of dongles plus the extra cost just to get my device to work as i need it would be a giant PITA. In the end it was a deal breaker and i ended up with a non Apple device. Each to their own i guess. I'd love to know what we get for the lack of headphone port.\u000a7v6 spec compaisons show identical external dimensions and only a 4-5g weight saving.\u000aNot that I mind, I dont use wired headphones much anymore Its funny how international troll day always falls on the same day as an iPhone release. "In the smartphone world, it\u2019s (almost ironically) like giving Apple a second right-click mouse button where its competitors only have left-click."\u000aAlthough Android don't have force touch, you have always been able to hold your finger on something and get a menu, similar to what windows does with the right click. Was this written by someone that has never used an android phone?? Android API has had getPressure for touch since V1, but it has typically mapped to touch area rather than actual pressure because screen pressure wasn't detected (but when you push harder your finger squashes to cover more screen).\u000aSomeone did implement force touch (of a sort) for waterproof Sony phones, because pressure leads to an increase in internal barometer reading (because waterproof), which was pretty cool.\u000aFinally, there is the Huawei Mate S which has _actual_ touch pressure sensitivity. Apple has that too though. 3D Touch is different and UI elements have different actions applied to a tap, long tap or deep press (3D hard push). While it's a fairly boring example, for the home screen a tap will open an app, long press brings on an app management context (delete/move) and force touch opens action menus specific to the app. Maybe they should have said it's like a middle click. "WCG means a much broader range of colours can be displayed, and that means smoother gradation in the images and icons you see." All of which is completely useless unless you are in a highly controlled lighting environment. It is a complete waste of time on a mobile display. You won't see gradation on an 5" 720p screen without WCG so there really is no benefit to this for users (but it's good to see your were paying attention). "While Apple and its third-party partners haven\u2019t really given 3D Touch a killer hook yet, we happen to think it\u2019s an incredibly important piece of hardware. In the smartphone world, it\u2019s (almost ironically) like giving Apple a second right-click mouse button where its competitors only have left-click." Except that a long press on both Android and Windows Mobile does exactly the same thing, just as it used to on iOS, I believe. This is a made up feature that adds zero functionality. Congrats on drinking the Kool-Aid. Engadget did a spec comparison and this new iPhone reads like a mid-spec Android or WinMobile handset. Only a crazy person would think it was worth half what Apple are going to charge for it. It's also good to see they are finally catching up with Nokia phones from 2010 by abandoning the physical home button. Maybe that gives hope that they may eventually get an AMOLED display and a decent UI. But iPhone has long press as well. Force touch is third option. Third option? What's the first? It is nothing more than a means of bringing up a context menu, like right-click on a computer. As innovations go, Forcetouch is pretty lame. You'd have a tap, tap and hold, and forceful press - so it actually is different. Whether or not it's useful is down to UI design. Also decent UI is ultimately a subjective thing, Material Design isn't perfect and neither is the unpredictable back button behaviour between apps on Android. Disclosure: s7 Edge owner here. Tap does something different to tap+hold but Forcetouch does the same thing as tap+hold so there are only two things. For the record I think Android's UI is at least as bad as iPhone's, possibly worse. Once you have enjoyed the fluidity and style of Metro, every other OS seems primitive and clunky. No, it actually doesn't, have you used it? Tap and hold and  tap and press is a different trigger in iOS. For example on the home screen: Tap = open, hold = move icons, press = menu. It doesn't replicate the "tap and hold" and doesn't duplicate the same response, it's a separate trigger that can activate an entirely different response (the idea being it'd bring up a menu... which is also a UI nightmare because older phones don't support it, hence why it isn't really used much except as a gimmick!) Also I think Metro is the worst of the lot and I'll never touch a Windows Phone again... and probably won't have to at this rate! Forcetouch does have uses. Think of graphics tablets. You can press harder to draw a thicker line. Makes creating digital artwork a little more natural and intuitive. Of course, doing that on a 5 inch screen is kinda pointless. Nice addon for the big tablet though. The way I see it 'Force touch' is like analogue sticks on your gamepads. Force touch could be used in games to add real analogue control to mobile games. Ie. In racing games the harder your press the sharper your turn. All these Apple innovations are great, but does it catch on fire like the Samsung Galaxy 7? ;) I can't be the only one who thought this straight away?  https://twitter.com/N7jpicard/status/773713037144432640 So if the iPhone 6 is fine for my practical purposes there is really no need to upgrade unless out of contract = out of warranty. I've been holding Samsung S5 for a while now and the screen is unbelievable, I feel sorry to hear that iPhones are way behind not sure why. I wouldn't hate the ditching of older tech, S7 took on USB-C didn't it, and it explodes also. Sticking with the S5. The additional beauty of the S5 is that with the new Android 6 deployment now available, the SD card is part of the memory so t here is no distinction. 16 GB phones are no longer a problem. Plus i think on ebay it goes for $300ish so I would still feel bad if something happens to it but I really don't want to be carrying $1000+ phones anymore, it's just not right. Fittingly, my contract is up in two weeks. Great timing! Jet Black 256g iPhone 7 Plus here I come! This isn't  journaliusm. its payola. Id wager that following the money would yeild a telling tale. I dont mind iphones, but gushy writing like this is shameful. gizmodo you have lost the last few shreds of integrity you had lefty. I doubt I'll ever go back to Apple after experiencing the greatness of Note7. Honestly the Note7 feels at least 5 years ahead of my old iphone 6s. ...and no earphone jack? Is this a joke? Who needs stereo speakers on a phone?? \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 10:17 pm								 When I first got my Note 7, I thought it was future / alien tech. It just feels that far ahead of anything else out there. Sadly, the Corning Gorilla Glass 5 at 0.2mm thickness, was curved, compromising the strength. So my screen cracked, then we have the disastrous battery exploding recall. The Phone still is the best there is, but it's now turned off and going back to Samsung, waiting for a new improved version. One thing I will say tho. The audio quality of a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is top of the line, the DAC was co-developed with Wolfson. Note: This is only true with the Exynos variant. This means super high quality audio, 24bit 196Khz. Getting SACD quality FLAC's is the best thing you can do for your ears, if you have one of these. Yeah a cracking screen and exploding battery are obvious signs of "the best there is". Here I am with my loser uncracked screen and house not burnt down, how will I cope. \u000a									Last edited September 10, 2016 12:16 am								 Imagine if we could get patdude a job in journalism just to watch his concept of how the world works unravel under the harsh glare of reality. So either wireless or thunderbolt for audio. Sounds like Apple has given up on the Audiophile. Plugs are for quality, not just convenience. What's the SNR for the wireless or thunderbolt option? Can't be good. Also what sort of DAC can you fit in the ear buds? Doubt they will do that well with a good 24bit 196Khz FLAC. Well, the iPhone doesn't have Thunderbolt - is has a lightening connector. SNR of the lightening connector isn't really applicable from an audio perspective as the audio SNR will be determined by whatever audio device is connected to it. Not defending the removal of the 3.5mm plug, but I don't think its removal is a loss from an audio quality perspective. From an interoperability and open standards perspective however ... The Australia tax is still in play then, $300 more in Australia than the US, christ knows what the price will be like in Tasmania, we have to pay the Bass Straight tax on top. This is my contribution: http://appleplugs.com/ ALL I WANT IS APPLEPAY. How bad do you want it? Switch to ANZ. APPLE pay is awesome.

VApple finally went through with it. It killed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. In its place, you can use headphones that connect to the Lightning port. But Apple thinks the future is wireless headphones. And AirPods are its vision for that future.\u000a\u000aAirPods are \u201ctruly wireless\u201d earbuds in the way that I\u2019ve been fantasising about them for years. It\u2019s a beautiful concept that nobody has been able to get it right. I\u2019ve tried many to various degrees of disappointment. So imagine my surprise on discovering after a brief demo that AirPods aren\u2019t complete garbage. Visually, AirPods look like what would happen if you snapped a pair of EarPods off from their cable. If I\u2019m honest, the design looks a little bit first-generation. It lacks polish that I\u2019m used to seeing from Apple\u2019s design team. I imagine we\u2019ll see a more refined look evolve in the coming years. Image: Christina Warren/Gizmodo The AirPods have a special W1 wireless chip embedded inside. This chip (along with Apple\u2019s software) helps them pair quickly with your phone, bypassing the pairing annoyances that plague Bluetooth setup these days. Simply open up the carrying case (which doubles as the headphone charger) and the Pods immediately pair with your phone. To the best of what I could ascertain, this is all still happening over Bluetooth. An Apple demo person told me that there was some \u201cspecial sauce\u201d that makes the Bluetooth pair process better, but the underlying technology isn\u2019t anything new. This is cause for concern because though Bluetooth fidelity and reliability have improved in recent years, it\u2019s still not the flawless technology most people desire. Still, the pairing process worked seamlessly, even though I was in a room with hundreds of press people and God only knows how many devices spitting out radio signals. As soon as I opened the carrying case by an iPhone, the AirPods would start the pairing process almost instantly. So easy. Image: Christina Warren/Gizmodo The slickness doesn\u2019t stop at the pairing. In one smart feature, if you start music playback on your phone and you don\u2019t have AirPods in your ear, music won\u2019t start playing. In fact, it will only start playback when little sensors in the buds detect that they\u2019re nestled in your ear canal. And if you remove an AirPod from your ear, music playback stops immediately. And of course, this is all one step closer to turning you into a drone with a computer in your head. Double tapping on the side of an AirPod fires up up Siri. From there, you can control playback, volume or ask other questions using the microphones at the bottom of each AirPod. I do wish there was some gesture support on the devices for stuff like skip or pause because those are functions I use on my wired headphones ALL THE TIME. Talking is cool but sometimes you just want immediate feedback you can only get from physical contact. Also, it\u2019s just weird to be the person in public who appears to be shouting orders to their imaginary friends. AirPods aren\u2019t noise cancelling, but in my brief experience in a bustling scene, they did a nice job blocking out sound. On a similar note, the microphone is tuned so that when you\u2019re talking, it filters outside noise and just hears your voice. I had no trouble talking to Siri, even in a crowd. As for the sound quality, I couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by how loud and full the sound from the AirPods was. Listening to a Sia track, the notes were crisp and the highs seemed really solid. The track I was listening to didn\u2019t have a ton of bass, but on first inspection it seemed to be at least passable. Let me put it this way: AirPods sound way better than wired EarPods. I know that isn\u2019t saying much, but it\u2019s worth noting when you consider that the design is very, very similar. Image: Christina Warren/Gizmodo In terms of feel, AirPods might as well be EarPods. My friend (and ear model) Dan said they seemed more comfortable to him, but I honestly couldn\u2019t tell the difference. EarPods work in some ears and not in others. They fit fine enough in my ears, but if you\u2019re the type of person who doesn\u2019t like the feel of an EarPod, the AirPod probably isn\u2019t for you. That may seem like I\u2019m damning these things with faint praise, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve tried a number of different wireless earbuds over the last year and most of them feel like earplugs. Which is to say, they aren\u2019t comfortable AT ALL. The worst thing you can say about AirPods is that they feel like EarPods, which is actually sort of a step in the right direction. While in my ears, the AirPods felt secure, which is important for expensive wireless earbuds. That said, I wouldn\u2019t want to go running with these things. Image: Christina Warren/Gizmodo Battery life on the AirPods is promised at about five hours. That\u2019s fairly standard for these types of wireless earphones. The included carrying case doubles as a battery pack (also common for these types of buds) and offers another 24 hours of reserve power you can use to juice your Pods back up. Apple claims that if you pop the AirPods in the case for just 15 minutes, you can get three hours of listening time. Although I don\u2019t love the design of the AirPods, I do like how quickly they pair to your phone. And at $229, this is actually one of the few Apple products that doesn\u2019t seem supremely overpriced. I\u2019d need more time to get a sense of the actual audio quality, but my first impression wasn\u2019t bad. We\u2019ll let you know more when the AirPods are available in late October.

That's my main worry. Apple want you to lose them, that way you'll go buy another pair.  When you just lose the left one, be sure that they wont just sell you a replacement lefty either There will be plenty of individual left or right ones for sale on eBay from people who have lost one and bought a new pair.  By around 4pm on the days it's released. Ew "At $229 that is one apple product that doesnt seem overpriced"\u000aMan, are you for real?\u000aMy kids go through about 4 or 5 pairs a year either lost or broken. They will not be getting a chance at this thing. This! Enjoyed reading the article until this statement. I like to wash mine in the washing machine..........and if its winter put them through the dryer too. You could get a really nice set of Audio Technica IEM's for that price.. Can you be more specific about the AT IEMs? Which model? I'm currently using the ATH-E40's, which are a "budget" model and retail for $169 in Aus. They sound absolutely fantastic for the money. My only complaint is I'd like a little bit more air/presence in the really high end, but I'm used to open back AKG's.  Low impedance so they're easy to drive, detailed and exciting sound, replaceable cables. All good. Not sure where the $229 price came from.. They announced them at $159.00 at the event and it's on apple's website as $159.00. They're $229 from Apple Australia. They come to about $208 from the $159 USD price tag but that's without any sales tax & ours is with GST so yeah. I think the author meant in the context of wireless earbuds these are not overpriced. I can't imagine comparing $229 to the cheap headphones we give our kids was his intention. Ahh... Whoops \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 8:43 am								 Read the article. So you can't use just one! Lose one and you can't listen to a podcast on the other. They are overpriced -_- I wonder if this wireless technology will mean they will also have more direct control of who can make headphones for the phone. It's all so unnecessary. The reality is, to use these wireless headphones, people are going to end up with models with a short cord between the two, maybe that you wear behind you head. It's too open to falling and being lost otherwise. People then have to carry around a carry case to store and charge the headphones or else after a few hours they run out of battery. Now a new problem, headphones running out of battery. Hands free? So will there now be an additional attachment to clip on your top for wireless hands free calls? Will that then need it's own battery case? It just seems like this creates more hassle. Even using the adapter is more hassle. Of course it is just to sell lighting port headphones. Which means you can't use headphones or hands free while charging. There are also a tonne of accessories that are now useless with these phones. I paid $280 for a some Bose in-ear noise cancelling head phones. Most comfortable headphone I have had and they block nearly 100% external noise. Why would I paid almost that much for some headphones that a) need to be charged every 5 hours and b) don't even offer noise cancelling? Because it's Apple and everything must be 100 times (being generous. It's probably closer to 200x more) more expensive than the production cost.\u000aOn a side note, I've used the earpods long ago, how the hell are people going to exercise with these in? The earpods used to fall out of my ears within minutes of any exercise beyond walking. These things will fall out and bust or you'll stand on them in no time. \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 9:25 pm								 What model? How long do the batteries last? If they are wireless - how do you use them on a plane with 3.5mm audio entertainment jacks?\u000aI'd ask the same of Airbuds, but I suspect they aren't intended for use on long flights. Can you recharge them while in use, or do you need to take them off like the Airbuds? my ears don't hold buds in very well. hopefully I can get an 'ear rope' so I don't lose them if they fall out. HEY LOOK EVERYONE AN APPLE ARTICLE!!!! Lets go and complain about everything possible. If you lose your sh*t like a 5 year old all the time, don't buy them.\u000aIf you remove one, the other keeps playing\u000aIf you think they look stupid, don't buy them. What is it with Apple articles? It's funny how on every apple article you're on here trying to make out like there's lots of anti-apple drama when really all people are doing is discussing the pros and cons of a product. This is Gizmodo, a place to have a discussion about the pros and cons of a product.  If all you want is marketing spiel, check out the official website of the product you want to buy. If you lose your sh*t like a 5 year old all the time, don't read apple article comments. Interesting move from an apple ecosystem perspective. I would be interesting to know if the pods pair equally well with apple devices. 5 hours is a little short for long flights but certainly more than enough for daily commuter use. Will be great to see what 3rd party offering also come out over time. International flight situations is the only place I can see issue with it, though I got a $300 noise cancelling Plantronics over-ear headset I wear anyway with 24 hours battery life. Everyone is so salty over this optional headphones. I personally don't mind their look and compared to what the competition is doing such as Samsung their headphones the Gear Icon X wireless ones only get 1.5 hours of battery life on Bluetooth streaming (Bragi is only just 2+ on streaming). These are also a couple of dollars cheaper. Only thing I'm nothing which no one seems to mention is if I can still control music VIA the phone and not through Siri because I'm normal and don't want to talk to myself in public like that :| IconX is 3 hours per charge, 5 charges per case. Worse than the apple ones, but not as bad as you made out. https://www.androidpit.com/samsung-gear-iconx-review \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 11:15 am								 That is IF you're using the inbuilt 4GB memory when streaming it only 1.5 hours so I am being completely accurate. What's worse \u2013 significantly worse \u2013 is the fact that the Gear IconX can become too hot while in your ear, making the gadget almost impossible to use. In this sense, that one-hour battery life can act as an unsophisticated security measure.  From the article you provided. Apples to apple I am directly comparing their streaming battery life. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 5:20 pm								 Ah yeah fair enough! Yeah they look like shockingly bad headphones on paper lol. The inbuilt memory sounds cool but would probably be impractical! \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 5:24 pm								 Main reason why I would only compare streaming is I live through Spotify so my playlist are in that and I'm too entrenched to change. The 5 Hours on the Airpods is long enough for me as I rarely listen to music for more than the travel time of wherever I am going and at home I got my stereo system. If Samsung & Bragi released with 5-6 hours they would be competitive but they went too small, guess we'll see how well the Airpods stay in ear though.  My solution http://earskinz.com/collections/es2 Apparently these do have some form of Noise cancellation but only for calls. A special W1 wireless chip for pairing! Hang on, doesn't NFC do that. Oh that's right. I think provides a MAC address to Apple ID to be shared across multiple devices wherever you are logged in which is a fair bit different to how NFC behaves as a single sync technology. Hey that's a funny headline because everyone complaining about the headphones has been so focused on the terrible sound. Or maybe sound hasn't come up at all. Anyone know what a straw man is? Great innovation again from apple, the amount of tech packed into these things is amazing. I will be getting a pair and i will be laughing at the haters! enjoy.

V\u000a\u000aMust admit wherever I go I see people trying to look at information on their smartphone which is covered in cracks. And I wonder how can they do that without getting it fixed (having said that there\u2019s a growing crack in my car windscreen that I haven\u2019t had fixed yet so maybe I shouldn\u2019t throw the first proverbial stone). Anyway iMend.com, a nationwide call-out mobile phone repair service, has put a figure on the number of people walking around with a broken phone of some sort and it\u2019s rather high: 19.2 million or over 40% of us are guilty apparently. The research, which polled 2000 people across the UK, found that 21.7% are using a phone with a cracked screen, 16% need a battery replacement and 10% say that their smartphone does not charge properly. The research also revealed that 41% of those with a broken mobile admit they have not bothered fixing it because they are still able to make and receive phone calls, while over a quarter (27%) said they are worried about how much they will have to fork out to fix their mobile. Another 31% are waiting out their contract (even though the average person with a broken phone has six months left on their contract), and 28% of Brits think repairing their smartphone is a slow process which takes 7-10 days. iMend.com also found that 29% of Brits think putting a phone in a bag of rice is a good way to fix water damage (yep have done that unsuccessfully), while 6% think leaving a phone on top of a radiator will aid its recovery. Despite our \u2018laissez-faire\u2019 approach to the upkeep of our smartphones, having a fully non-functioning device would be quite traumatic for the average Brit, who could only last 3.4 days without a working phone, and 40% admitted they could only last a day or less. When it comes to iPhone repair iMend.com only charges £40-60 to fix a broken screen and £29.99 to fix water damage \u2013 but almost a third of Brits (31%) think it would cost around £100 or more to fix a broken phone. Says Keir McConomy, founder of iMend.com: \u201cBrits walking around with damaged phones are living on the edge of a crack-tastrophe \u2013 not least because most of them can\u2019t survive for more than a couple of days without their handsets. Although your phone may still be functioning, a cracked screen is susceptible to water ingression, which is why it is important to seek professional help to prevent irreversible damage as soon as a crack appears. Most customers are worried that getting a device repaired will void the manufacturer\u2019s warranty \u2013 however as accidental damage is outside of the manufacturer\u2019s warranty anyway, this is just another myth around getting your phone repaired.\u201d Top reasons for damaged smartphones (source: OnePoll research commissioned by iMend.com) Top five phones repaired (source: repairs made through iMend.com)            Great points here by Chris. Sometimes repairing doesn\u2019t make sense, which is why we started http://phonebum.com It\u2019s incredible, just how many people do have a broken phone, and never really bother to fix it.

V   At the fifth annual uSwitch Broadband Awards, voted for by over 5,000 consumers and an independent judging panel of 14 journalists, Virgin Media scooped an impressive six out of 12 awards including best for both broadband and TV. The communications giant was rated highly by its customers, winning acknowledgement for its fast broadband and range of TV content. Value broadband and home phone provider Plusnet also took home three awards for the second year running. As well as scooping up Best Broadband and Home Phone, its cheap fibre offerings helped secure the trophy for Best Value Home Broadband \u2013 despite stiff competition from runner up BT, which also offers competitively priced fibre packages. Plusnet customers are also the happiest of the bunch, enjoying the best customer service. EE is still benefitting from its head start in bringing 4G to the UK, as it claims victory once again with the Fastest Mobile Broadband. Providing 93% of 4G coverage in the UK compared to runner up O2, which has over 80%, EE has gained a lot of ground and may hold onto this award for years to come if left unchallenged. Streaming services like Netflix and Now TV continue to challenge traditional TV providers, with Netflix voted top of the class in the category for Best TV Streaming Service. Exclusive content like House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black has helped it beat off stiff competition from Now TV\u2019s popular Sky Sports Day Pass. Meanwhile Sky and TalkTalk shared the gong for Best Broadband Innovation. Their Ultra Fibre Optic Broadband initiative in York is part of an ongoing trial, which is capable of offering speeds 100 times faster than standard broadband. Ewan Taylor-Gibson, broadband expert at uSwitch.com, says: \u201cVirgin Media\u2019s blend of superfast broadband, competitive pricing and excellent TV content has proved a winning combination. Well known for its speedy broadband, this year is the first time Virgin has been recognised for its TV services, proving that being the one-stop shop for Sky and BT Sport channels, as well as Netflix, has paid off. \u201cAlso a multi-award winner, Plusnet\u2019s winning combination of great value and UK based customer service means it appeals to existing customers as well as attracting new ones. Affordable fibre deals and TV content were the key battlegrounds for telecoms providers in 2015, as more households upgraded to avoid being tethered to sluggish speeds or lacklustre content. Original TV programmes, which have been hugely popular, have helped Netflix secure the top spot for Best TV Streaming Service over rivals Now TV and Amazon Prime.\u201d See the full list of winners and runners up for each of the 12 categories in the table below.

p636
VScientists have been arguing over the authenticity of an ancient document called the Grolier Codex for 50 years. A new analysis published in a special section of the journal Maya Archaeology has concluded that the codex is indeed genuine, making it the oldest surviving manuscript from the pre-Colombian era.  The Grolier Codex is the oldest known manuscript in ancient America. (Image: Justin Kerr) Perhaps you\u2019re not familiar with the Grolier Codex. It\u2019s the surviving pages of a 20-page book, made of stucco-coated bark paper folded into an accordion shape. The pages are painted with typical Maya iconography \u2014 gods, warriors, slaves, and hieroglyphs, for instance \u2014 and include a calendar charting the movement of the planet Venus. Legend has it that looters ransacking a cave in Mexico came across the badly damaged pages in the 1960s, along with a turquoise mask, a sacrificial knife, and some blank pieces of fig-bark paper. That\u2019s according to a Mexican collector named Josue Saenz, who claimed he was contacted by the looters and taken by plane to a remote airstrip to collect the items \u2014 although at least one archaeologist, Donna Yates, has called this account \u201cfantastical\u201d. Saenz\u2019s questionable account and subsequent actions cast doubt on the authenticity of the fragments from the start, even though the other artifacts have since been shown to be genuine. Scientists tested the codex in 2007, but couldn\u2019t decisively settle the matter of its authenticity, partly because while many of the materials used were pre-Colombian, some of the wear and tear in the pages seemed artificial.  It was possible a gifted forger may have used materials from the right period to throw off archaeologists. And radiocarbon dating revealed the blank pages of bark paper found with the codex pegged them to around 1230 AD. A detail from the Grolier Codex. (Image: Justin Kerr) \u201cIt became a kind of dogma that this was a fake,\u201d co-author Stephen Houston of Brown University said in a statement. \u201cWe decided to return and look at it very carefully, to check criticisms one at a time. Now we are issuing a definitive facsimile of the book. There can\u2019t be the slightest doubt that the Grolier is genuine.\u201d Along with Harvard University\u2019s Michael Coe, and Mary Miller and Karl Taube of the University of California, Riverside, Houston reviewed all the known research on the codex. That included assessing the manuscript\u2019s origins, the carbon dating results, the various deities depicted, how the bark paper was made, the Maya blue pigments, and thin red sketch lines underneath the paintings, among other aspects. The team concluded that a forger in the 1960s simply could not have known all the details required to create such a forgery. Many of the deities shown in the codex hadn\u2019t even been discovered then, for example, and scientists didn\u2019t successfully make Maya blue in the lab until the 1980s. There are three other known (authenticated) ancient Maya manuscripts, known as the Dresden, Madrid, and Paris Codices, in addition to the Grolier Codex. There are variations among them, but all include astronomical calendars tracking the movements of heavenly heavenly bodies. And radiocarbon dating shows the Grolier predates the other three. \u201cA reasoned weighing of evidence leaves only one possible conclusion,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cFour intact Mayan codices survive from the Precolumbian period, and one of them is the Grolier.\u201d [Maya Archaeology]

VVodafone has unveiled its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus pricing ahead of Australian pre-order availability and they\u2019re looking pretty good. The plans start at $40 a month (plus handset repayments) for a total of $76. Here\u2019s the full list of plans for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 will be available on Vodafone\u2019s Red mobile plans which start at $40 a month. All plans are on a 24-month contract, with monthly handset repayments depending on the plan and model. Data ranges from a measly 1GB on the $40 plan to 24GB on the top-range $120 offering. Ever plan includes unlimited national calls and national text messages. (For people who still use their phones for that stuff.) Here\u2019s a breakdown of what you get with each plan: It\u2019s worth noting that Vodafone periodically provides bonus data deals to new customers. Last year, the telco added up to 5GB of extra data to coincide with the launch of the iPhone 6s.  So keep an eye on its special offers in the coming weeks.  Even if there\u2019s no bonus data this time around, the plans are still on par with the iPhone 6s. For example, the entry-level $40 plan for the 32GB iPhone 7 nets 1GB of data with monthly handset repayments of $19. The same plan for the iPhone 6s only bagged you 500MB of data with monthly handset repayments of $30. So you\u2019re getting more data for better prices, compared to last year.  On the other hand, almost every iPhone 7 plan now includes a monthly handset repayment, whereas last year all plans $80 and above gave you the handset for free \u2014 so it really depends on your specific data needs. Click through to sign up to one of these plans:       We\u2019ll be back with a full iPhone 7 Planhacker once Telstra, Optus and Virgin release their pricing. Watch this space! There's no iPhone 7 64gb Pricing tables have now been fixed :) Is that right that the 7 and 7+ with 9GB options cost exactly the same each month? That can't be right... Hey just a heads up, the iPhone 7 Plus 32GB total prices have been calculated incorrectly.

VWelcome to Fitmodo, your regular weekly round up of the news you need to know to keep your earthly form in top shape \u2014 from fitness advice to breakthroughs in medical research.  This week: Pokemon GO, water resistance, advanced fitness tracking, built-in GPS for phone-free running, Apple Pay \u2014 meet the Apple Watch Series 2, with its brighter display, dual-core processor and improved ease of use. To have it work for you, you\u2019ll need to be running iPhone 5 or later running iOS 10 (releasing 14 September) or later. Of course, you could do that by buying a new iPhone 7. The Withings Activité and the far more affordable Withings Activité Pop showed the world that fitness trackers don\u2019t necessarily have to look hideous. And while the new heart rate-tracking Steel HR makes some aesthetic compromises to gain smartwatch functionality, it\u2019s still one of the most beautiful wearables you can buy. Instead of using an LCD or OLED display to provide feedback on the wearer\u2019s activities, the Activité and Activité Pop both featured a traditional analogue watch face with a smaller dial in one corner showing how close the user was to their pre-defined fitness goal \u2014 be it steps taken, calories burned or other metrics configured in the Withings app. Yeah, we know, your CrossFit gym has completely changed your life, you\u2019ve never looked/felt better, and all other exercise programs pale in comparison. But you may want to ease off the intensive workouts now and then. All that over-exertion can actually impair your immune system, according to a new study just published in Frontiers in Physiology.

VThis week\u2019s episode of Mr. Robot hinted at what really happened to those missing characters, brought the FBI that much closer to the truth, and had an explosive ending\u2026 At least for one character\u2019s head.  Image: Michael Parmelee/USA Network Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could control a scene in such a way that it controlled the audience too, building up our terror and worry, again and again, until a moment of violence (or even just a scream) felt cathartic. Show creator and director Sam Esmail manages to pull off such a feat in last night\u2019s episode of Mr. Robot. The last 10 minutes are scored by the same thrumming beat of a synthesiser, neatly building the tension as so many of the disparate threads of the season are finally tied together. Dom tracks down Cisco and Darlene to a diner, Darlene comes to terms with her role in Fsociety and accepts that she\u2019s not the nefarious mastermind she\u2019s spent the entire season trying to be, and Elliot and Angela sit on a train and are finally honest with one another for the very first time since this show began. All three sequences are moments that these characters have been careening towards all season (and in Elliot and Angela\u2019s case, since the pilot). Image: Michael Parmelee/USA Network\u000aEsmail weaves them all together, so instead of three small, individual moments, they create a slow build-up and a nagging sense of doom. In a show like Mr. Robot characters don\u2019t usually get to have satisfying moments like the three awarded to us in quick succession. Those moments come with a price, and it\u2019s clear someone on screen \u2014 someone we care about \u2014 is going to have to pay it. I watched the walls of the subway flicker past in the background of Elliot and Angela\u2019s scene and was filled with dread. Any moment, I told myself, a gun would appear and Angela\u2019s head would disappear. Dom darted across traffic, growing closer and closer to some of the truths she\u2019s spent the season searching for and I winced at the flash of every headlight. And poor Darlene smiled at Cisco while sitting in a corner booth of a restaurant, surrounded by windows. When the gunman rode up on a motorcycle, Esmail kept the camera on him, indulgently settling it across the street from the action and forcing us to watch everything happen \u2014 reminding us that as much as Elliot has invited us into his world we\u2019re still just an audience, hapless riders on Sam Esmail\u2019s rollercoaster, watching death stalk characters we like for 10 minutes straight. Death almost certainly found Cisco, whose blood coats Dom\u2019s face as she races out into the street to confront a Dark Army assassin. But Darlene seemed to go down as well. She disappeared under the booth, either dragged by Dom or caught in the focused spray of gunfire. Elliot\u2019s safe, as is Dom herself, the white knight hero a show like this should abhor. But Angela appears to be\u2026 in some trouble. Last week she tried to go whistleblower, rightfully panicked, and fled. This week she doesn\u2019t appear onscreen until that 10-minute descent into nail-biting tension. Her moment of decisiveness happens off screen, but she immediately tells Elliot her decision. She\u2019s turning herself in and she\u2019s going to protect him and Darlene as much as she can. Image: Michael Parmelee/USA Network\u000aIt\u2019s totally a romantic choice on her part. She knows exactly what Elliot and Darlene did and she\u2019s fully aware of how much their actions have screwed up her own life. But she still cares about them \u2014 Elliot in particular. This is her childhood best friend. A guy she\u2019s stuck with and supported through psychotic breaks and jail and an Fsociety-induced apocalypse. She might not care about Elliot like he cares about her, but her feelings are profound and deep-rooted. And Elliot loves Angela. He has from the first episode, when the chemistry between the two of them made for one of the most memorable moments of the pilot. They have been separated for an entire season, their few encounters warped by Elliot\u2019s muddled brain. But that tension between them flares the moment they step into the camera frame together. It\u2019s the first time in eons they have shared the frame and the camera itself seems to want them to kiss, to realise a fantasy only know that Elliot has harbored. And maybe Angela harbored it too. She closes her eyes. She cups his cheek. She cries when he leaves. But whatever Angela\u2019s feelings are they disappear as soon as two faceless characters appear in the frame. Angela\u2019s been found, and her first kiss with Elliot might be her last.

V Remember Honda\u2019s iconic Cog ad, from over a decade ago? Honda has re-made that ad, showing what it might have been if knock-off parts were used. The results are\u2026 predictable. The \u2018Kog\u2019 ad, made by Honda Ontario in Canada, is barely 15 seconds long, but it doesn\u2019t need to be any longer. The implication is pretty clear: use dodgy parts and things won\u2019t run so smoothly for your car. Fun fact: the Cog ad cost a million pounds and took seven hours to film \u2014 but six months to plan, with some of the parts needing to be positioned within one sixteenth of an inch. Here it is for posterity:  Still one of the best car ads I've seen Yeah, same here.  Loved it back then, nothings changed.  Favorite part was the wipers walking across the floor to do their thing, that just summed up the whole fun of the ad. Here I was all these years being 100% confident it was all/mostly CGI. I always thought too many of the movements didn't look natural.\u000aI'm also pretty sure that the car coming off the ramp at the end was a different model in the ads I saw as a kid. oh why didnt honda sell the station wagon accord in Australia looks good I don't understand how the wheels go up the ramp though, unless they ran a weight inside the wheel on the front? Correct, they do. I think they have the pistons from the engine in them.\u000aImagine a weight in the wheel at positions 12, and 6 from a clock. If you push it over, it rolls.\u000aWatch the ad in HD and widescreen and keep an eye on the left edge, you can see the wheels start to roll back as they exit the frame. Or more like these are the outtakes from the original ad.

VIt remains frustratingly difficult to convey what is good or interesting about new VR games, especially to anyone who hasn\u2019t already played games while wearing virtual reality goggles. New VR games come out weekly, many of them not so great. Sometimes, though, we find a game with a spark of promise we need to tell you about.  This article originally appeared on Kotaku Australia. Take the marvellous game Darknet, which actually came out for the Oculus Rift back in March. I just discovered it this weekend. It\u2019s a puzzle game about hacking that, like many VR games, would be far less remarkable if it weren\u2019t in VR. When you start playing Darknet, you see a vast web of hackable spheres, each protected by varying levels of security. You pick one to hack, zoom into it and will find a large hexagonal grid that you must strategically plant viruses into, corrupting the the core. Then you zoom out and see how that hack affects the rest of the web, gradually turning more of the web in your favour. What\u2019s special about the game in VR is that its hackable web surrounds you. You don\u2019t feel like you are playing this game on a framed TV screen or monitor in your house. You feel \u2014 you see \u2014 the game\u2019s playing field, as if you are a floating eye inside of it. The visual metaphor is that you\u2019re floating in cyberspace, inside a computer. It\u2019s all around you, everywhere you turn and tilt your head to see. The best we can show you what I\u2019m describing is with some direct feed capture from my PC. Here is a minute of captured footage mapped to my gaze. I look down and up and around, admiring the game board around me. Then I zoom in to play a wall-sized challenge.  I suspect this footage will look plain to you. It will look underwhelming or a little nauseating. It\u2019s like showing you a postcard of the sky instead of having you stand under the starry night yourself. Or maybe you will be able to imagine it. Look at it. Close your eyes, look down and up and around and imagine you are seeing the game board around you. The headsets\u2019 difficulty of use will affect people differently. The best Vive experiences involve tech that tracks your movement in a rectangular space about the size of a parking spot. My Brooklyn apartment is small and has no room for a dedicated VR gaming area, so I have to slide the living room couch back and set the Vive\u2019s sensors back up any time I want to play a Room-scale VR game.  I have to break it back down every time I\u2019m done playing, which keeps me from regularly dipping back into even my favourite Vive project to date, the Early Access, constantly updated first-person real-time strategy game Cosmic Trip. Seated VR experiences require less room and should fit into my life better. They\u2019re less thrilling but easier to commit to, especially on the Rift. Oculus\u2019 machine is particularly easy to just plug in and play. Its interface boots up as soon as you plug in the headset and pick it up.  Even that has its weird discomforts. I first used my VR headsets in the spring, noticed that the headset warmed my face but didn\u2019t pay it much mind. Contrast that to playing it in the hot summer, even with AC on. It gets uncomfortable more quickly. Perhaps I\u2019ll be playing more VR in the winter. Some of the games coming to VR just don\u2019t seem to need it or benefit much from it. The tower-defence game CastleStorm has a new VR version. It adds some visual depth to a game that is still played in 2D. Arguably it looks cooler to see it in VR, though the most interesting part about it in virtual reality is the feeling of sitting in a virtual theatre when it begins. The game\u2019s menus are rendered as if projected on a 2D movie screen, but you\u2019re in a seat with a bucket of popcorn to your right. Again, it helps if you see it in actual VR and, of course, it doesn\u2019t add anything great to the game.  If there\u2019s something that VR games seem to be getting good at really quickly it\u2019s presenting impressive title screens and lobbies. Here\u2019s a brief bit from the beginning of this week\u2019s big new Rift release, the sci-fi shooter Damaged Core.  It may look like nothing to you, but for players wearing a RIft, it looks like you\u2019re standing not in your living room but in a vast field with a space trooper to your left and the game\u2019s logo flying in overhead. It\u2019s impressive.  Damaged Core is actually a pretty cool game \u2026. for a VR game. It\u2019s developed by shooter studio High Voltage, best known, I think, for their Wii shooter The Conduit. Their Rift debut has a contrived conceit, as many VR games do, that seems primarily designed to explain the exclusion of gaming tropes that when rendered into VR might make you throw up.  Movement in a lot of these games, if programmed poorly, can make the player queasy. Your inner ear gets confused and suddenly what you think is just going to be a turn of your head to see what\u2019s next to you as your character runs forward instead is triggering a wave of nausea. Well, in Damaged Core, no need to worry about that. Good news! No matter which VR games you play, you\u2019ll at least look like the coolest person in the world.\u000aThis is a game in which you are a consciousness that teleports into enemy robots on a battlefield, hopping from one bot to the next as you seize control of the enemy, possess more and more impressive enemy brutes and flying drones and the the like.  The nausea-removing catch is that the enemy tech will resist you and (of course!) immediately disables the ability of the enemy bots you possess to move from where they are standing or floating. Get it? They eliminate character movement other than swivel-aiming and as a result you never feel ill.  Instead, you can enjoy a game that borrows the under-used mechanic of warping from body to body during a battle seen in games such as Geist, Battalion Wars, and Battlefield 2: Modern Combat. Giant enemy bruiser walks onto the battlefield in Damaged Core? Turn the attention of the little foot-soldier bot that you\u2019re controlling to that bruiser, shoot down his shields, possess him and then, now seeing the battle through his eyes, lay waste to the other enemy robots.  Each enemy robot you possess eventually shuts down completely, so you have to keep hopping from one enemy to the next. It\u2019s a good idea. It\u2019s fun. It works terrifically in VR as you feel the change of height and scale as you warp from bot to bot. Here\u2019s some footage, which might look to you like footage of a generic-looking sci-fi shooter, except now you have a trained eye and understand how much cooler this stuff looks in VR:  VR gaming has a long way to go, but there are some bright spots. Next up: we\u2019ll see what the launch of PlayStation VR accomplishes in October. I think experience is going to vary drastically based on how much room you have to dedicate to VR. I'm lucky enough to have a large room with my Vive permanently set up and I hardly play any normal games any more. I'll sit down meaning to play dark souls or something and look at the headset and just change my mind and bring up Space Pirate Trainer or Solus or Battle Dome. I wouldn't have done that if it wasn't already set up. That said Onward was just released in alpha last week and that is definitely worth clearing a room and shifting the couch. It's been the most fun I've had in a game, especially if you get a good team together.  If you've got time and can accept the odd glitch you get from an Alpha its well worth trying. How good is Space Pirate Trainer ! The amount of space makes a difference, many games I can't play unless I lift my bed up against my wall for the minimum floor space required, but even with the 1.2x2.2M space with my bed down, I use the ChaperoneTweak tool to bring the walls in to where my desk and bed edges are, and smaller than SteamVR would allow normally.  With this, I can still reach out over my bed and desk, and if I need to reach down, I just stay in the space. Probably play quite a few games like that now. even ones that usually would need more space like Island 359. Id say I clock about 8-16 hours of VR time a week still, depending on free time, new app releases. Still super happy with the Vive Onward is addictive. Check out the hours logged on for players on steam for a game released on Tuesday. About 32 for me.

VSpin Master has been doing some wonderful things when it comes to Star Wars toys, including a giant BB-8 that does almost everything the movie version did. But if space battles are more your thing, the company is releasing two new Air Hogs sets that let you recreate the space battles from the movies.\u000a The Air Hogs Star Wars X-wing vs. Death Star, Rebel Assault RC Drones set is probably our favourite of today\u2019s reveals. It comes with two well-known vehicles from the Star Wars universe, an X-wing and the Death Star, that can both actually fly. You only get to take control of the X-wing, however, as the Death Star flies and hovers all by itself. Both drones are equipped with infrared blasters, receivers, and LED status lights, and as the X-wing pilot you need to hit the Death Star three times to destroy the ultimate weapon before it successfully knocks you out of the sky. It will be available for pre-order starting on September 9 for $US130 ($169), and should arrive just in time for the holidays (and Rogue One). The other set Spin Master revealed today lets you and a friend battle it out in the skies over your living room coffee table. The Air Hogs Star Wars X-wing vs. TIE Fighter Drone Battle set, also available for pre-order starting on September 9 for $US200 ($260), comes with a flying X-wing and TIE fighter drone that are both equipped with infrared blasters and receivers. Like with the Death Star battle, each pilot is trying to knock the other ship out of the sky by being the first to score three infrared hits. But there\u2019s more of a challenge here since both drones are being piloted by a pair of included wireless controllers \u2014 you\u2019re not just trying to take down a stationary hovering opponent. The controllers also have a 60.96m range, so if you can find yourself a gymnasium or empty warehouse, you won\u2019t spend half your time crashing into your home theatre and lamps. [Spin Master]

VApple just wrapped up its special media event in California, where it launched the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and some other new hardware. This was easily one of the biggest technology events of the year and there were plenty of huge announcements you\u2019ll want to know about.\u000a\u000aIn typical form, Apple worked closely with big developers ahead of the event and even invited a few onto the stage. Niantec, Nike and Nintendo executives spoke briefly at the event while revealing new apps they built for Apple products. Of course, those appearances paled in comparison to the new hardware revealed at the event. In case you weren\u2019t able to catch all the news, here\u2019s everything you need to know about Apple\u2019s event today. After more than a year of speculation, Apple\u2019s new iPhones are finally here. Predictably named the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple\u2019s new gadgets look familiar but employ new hardware to give people even more useful tools. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have a redesigned home button that is now Force Touch sensitive, which will give people a little bit more control of the home screen. The new iPhone is also waterproof and includes a brand new camera that takes DSLR-quality photos. The iPhone 7 Plus model comes with a new dual-camera that gives the phone better zooming capabilities and depth of field settings. The new dual-camera system also uses machine learning to automate settings like focus, exposure, white balance, tone mapping and noise reduction, and even takes multiple photos and fuses them into one photo. The camera basically ensures you take a great photo every single time. In a surprising design choice, Apple did not include a headphone jack on the phone. \u201cThe reason to move on comes down to one word: Courage,\u201d Apple SVP Phil Schiller explained. \u201cThis is really important, our smartphones are packed with technologies\u2026 it\u2019s all fighting for space. Maintaining an ancient analogue connector doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d \u2026 [More] The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus\u2019s cameras can take DSLR-quality photos, thanks to a bunch of new hardware that\u2019s been jammed into the phone. Both models of the phone come with optical stabilisation that allows for exposures three times longer than previous iPhone models, and the larger f/1.8 aperture lets in 50 per cent more light. All of that pales in comparison to Apple\u2019s biggest camera announcement: The iPhone 7 Plus comes with a new dual camera that includes two lenses, one wide-angle and one telephoto. Both lenses are visible on the back of the phone. The combination of both lenses gives shooters a better chance to play with focal length and zooming in photos. The depth of field capabilities are something that is typically only seen in DSLRs. \u2026 [More] The Apple Watch is getting a bunch of much-needed updates with Watch OS 3, which was announced earlier this year in June at WWDC. In addition to a few tweaks to the user interface, Apple is also working with developers to get more useful features on the Apple Watch. At the event, Apple invited executives from Niantec and Nike to show off new features on the watch. But that all took a backseat to the new Apple Watch Series 2. The new hardware is waterproof, includes GPS and has the brightest display of any Apple product ever. The new watch costs $529 and older models (now dubbed Series 1) will cost $399. \u2026 [More] Do you hate when your headphones get tangled in your pocket? Apple is slowly phasing out its EarPods, so that won\u2019t be a problem for much longer. The company\u2019s new AirPods are basically wireless versions of the EarPods every iPhone user has come to know and love. The only catch is that you have to pay extra for them. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will ship with a pair of Lightning EarPods (that is, ones that connect to the charging port on the bottom of the iPhone). The phones will also ship with a Lightning-to-headphone jack dongle in the box, making it easier for your to retrofit any 3.5mm headphones you\u2019re currently using. Apple\u2019s AirPods will have five hours of charge and the carrying case with have 25 hours of charge. You can pair the AirPods to your iPhone by simply opening the carrying case. The AirPods cost $229, which is pretty reasonable for wireless headphones. \u2026 [More] Nintendo is bringing Super Mario to the iPhone in new game Super Mario Run, which looks a lot like Temple Run but with horizontal scrolling. The game allows you to run through Super Mario worlds using just one hand. When you tap on the screen, Mario leaps over obstacles and even does some cool tricks. In addition to a basic single-player mode, you can also play against friends and strangers. The winner of a game is determined by whoever collects the most number of coins and \u201cimpresses\u201d turtles by performing daring leaps of faith and other cool tricks with your player. Super Mario Run will be available by the holiday season of 2016, but it does not have a specific release date or pricing at this time. \u2026 [More] Amazon Just Blew The Lid Off The iPhone 7\u000aApple Just Accidentally Tweeted The Latest iPhone\u000aEverything You Need To Know About The Apple Watch Series 2\u000aSuper Mario Is Coming To The iPhone\u000aThe Apple Watch Series 2 Is \u2018Swimproof\u2019\u000aThe iPhone 7 Is Here: Everything You Need To Know\u000aHere It Is: The New Apple iPhone 7\u000aHow The New iPhone Camera Will Make Your Photos Better\u000aApple\u2019s AirPods Are The Tiny Wireless Earbuds Of The Future\u000aApple Is Finally (Slowly) Giving Up On 16GB Phones Has anyone else noticed the iPad Air 2 models (16GB and 64GB) both had their storage capacities doubled and prices dropped, overnight?

VThere are few things as good as a fresh, hot loaf of real sourdough bread but, due to its finicky nature, it can be a hard thing to nail at home. Luckily, Epicurious has a cheat for us, and it involves fresh yeast.  Photo by Fredrik Rubensson. The method, which comes from baker Adam Leonti of Brooklyn Bread Lab, and it is one of the easiest, most elegant ways to get tangy, chewy bread that is pretty close to the real thing, without having to deal with wild yeasts or strict temperature management. All you have to do is swap out instant or dry active yeast for fresh cake yeast. This type of yeast \u2014 which comes in a solid, compressed block and has a fresh, sour smell \u2014 can be purchased in the refrigerated section of most grocery stores or online. Once you\u2019ve acquired it, throw it into a no-knead bread recipe and bake it like you would any other simple, rustic loaf. The result won\u2019t be true sourdough, but it will be fairly close, and whole lot easier. The Secret Ingredient That Will Make Your Bread Taste Like Sourdough [Epicurious] The problem with fresh yeast is that most home bakers don't use enough to make the purchase worthwhile. It pretty much only comes in 1kg blocks in Australia, you only use about  3g fresh yeast for every 100g flour, and it goes off after about two weeks in the fridge. You'd have to make  about 160 loaves a week. I've hear of some folks freezing it off in 10g lumps and getting it to last a few months, but it's pretty iffy. It's easy enough to make a starter. Any unrefined flour will have enough wild yeast and acid-producing bacteria. It's just a matter of add water, keep warm and wait.

VWe\u2019re getting our first look at the most hyped addition to Marvel\u2019s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in, well, I\u2019d argue forever. He\u2019s hot, he\u2019s smouldering and he really loves hanging out in trash piles.  Credit: Jennifer Clasen/ABC Entertainment Weekly released the first photo of actor Gabriel Luna as Robbie Reyes, aka the Rider of Ghost, who\u2019s making his S.H.I.E.L.D. debut in Season 4. The character is based on the Marvel NOW! comic series, rather than the Johnny Blaze rendition that will forever be associated with Nicolas Cage\u2019s crazy fire face. The S.H.I.E.L.D. Twitter account also released a promotional video of Ghost Rider in action, in the former of some cell phone found footage. It doesn\u2019t give us much, but it does confirm that Robbie will be riding his black muscle car instead of Johnny\u2019s signature motorcycle. But come on, vertical video? Really? Found footage of #GhostRider. #AgentsofSHIELD pic.twitter.com/qMAJFIpuQM \u2014 Agents of SHIELD (@AgentsofSHIELD) September 4, 2016  According to the Season 4 synopsis: \u000aRobbie Reyes (Gabriel Luna) will roar into the lives of Agent Coulson and the team as a junkyard mechanic who can turn on a dime into the terrifying Ghost Rider. Will Robbie be a friend or foe to S.H.I.E.L.D. \u2014 as well as the world, itself?\u000a Executive producer Jed Whedon told EW that they\u2019re putting their own spin on the character, while keeping some of their favourite elements, like his East L.A. roots and family ties. Whedon also said Reyes\u2019 arrival continues Marvel\u2019s push into the unknown, regarding science vs. magic. \u201cIt started out with a guy building a suit using science, and then we met aliens that are the origin of the myths behind some of our gods, and this year Doctor Strange comes out,\u201d Whedon said. \u201cWe\u2019re opening it up even further to the world of things we don\u2019t totally understand, or as Thor says, \u2018Magic is science that we don\u2019t understand.\u2019 Well, we\u2019re getting into some very, very fancy science.\u201d SpoilerTV is reporting that the first episode of Season 4 is called \u201cThe Ghost,\u201d which (very very very) likely means we\u2019ll be seeing Reyes on screen pretty quickly.

VTomorrow morning, an asteroid-bound mission will launch towards a shadowy space rock, Bennu. There, it will scoop up a bit of dirt and deliver it back to us, all without ever attempting a landing. It\u2019s not just any dirt, though. Bound up in these grains could be the answer to how life first emerged here on Earth.\u000a\u000aImage: NASA Researchers have long theorised that comets or asteroids could have been responsible for delivering the first specks of organic materials or perhaps water that got things brewing on our planet. We have even found organic materials and chemically-bound water in meteorites that may have come from carbonaceous asteroids like Bennu. The problem is that these meteorites have spent so long on Earth that there\u2019s no way of knowing whether organic compounds inside them came from asteroids, Earth itself or somewhere else along their journey. This will be the first time that we ever have the opportunity to check that profile directly from the asteroid. \u201cThe reason we go to an asteroid like Bennu is we believe it\u2019s a pristine remnant of the very early solar system,\u201d Ed Beshore, the project\u2019s deputy principal investigator, told Gizmodo. \u201cIt\u2019s important because we want to answer questions about the rise of life on Earth.\u201d It will take two years until OSIRIS-REx even arrives at Bennu, and another two years before the sample is taken. The samples will get back to Earth in 2023. Image: NASA Still, there are several things that the mission can teach us even before we bring a little piece of the asteroid back. For one, it could help us better predict which asteroids are going to come close to us, and how close they will get. Bennu belongs to a category of close-by asteroids called Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs). In fact, this proximity was one of the reasons it was chosen for the mission. But, as we\u2019ve seen lately, the orbit of those NEAs \u2014 even when they buzz right next to us \u2014 can be hard to predict. This is due primarily to something called the Yarkovsky effect, which happens when asteroids are heated by the sun. \u201cAsteroids get hot,\u201d explained Beshore, \u201clike how asphalt streets get hot on the Earth. They rotate like the Earth does and that re-radiated heat acts like a tiny rocket thruster which can actually move the asteroid around.\u201d Since 1999, NASA has seen Bennu shift its trajectory over 160km from this effect. By studying Bennu\u2019s movements up-close, researchers hope to get a better idea of just how \u2014 and how much \u2014 the Yarkovsky effect is moving asteroids around. The real prize from Bennu, though, are the four tablespoons of asteroid dirt that will be scooped up by the spacecraft at the mission\u2019s conclusion and packed into its return capsule. How it will accomplish this collection is one of the trickiest aspects of the mission. Before any sample-taking is even attempted, scientists will first make a painstakingly complete map of the entire asteroid, a process that could take up to two years. From that first map, they will identify a dozen or so potential sampling sites, then create even more refined maps to choose the spot most likely for success. \u201cBy the end, we\u2019ll be able to see an object the size of a penny on Bennu,\u201d said Daniella DellaGiustina, the mission\u2019s lead image processing scientist. Once they have selected a spot, though, things get even more harrowing. While the craft buzzes the asteroid, a 3m-long \u201cpogo arm\u201d comes forth \u2014 like a boxing glove on a spring \u2014 to grab the sample. It\u2019s not just a simple scoop, though. The arm uses puffs of nitrogen gas to swirl some dirt from the asteroid up into a storage compartment in a matter of seconds. If the sample collection isn\u2019t successful the first time, engineers have made plans to do a couple of loop-backs, but as soon as the compartment has a full sample, the craft will immediately depart back to Earth. Image: NASA \u201cIt\u2019s a safe, slow, smooth high-five to collect that sample and bring it back to Earth\u201d explained Christina Richey, the mission\u2019s deputy program scientist. The entire collection will take just five seconds, she noted, but in those few seconds and approximately 60 grams of dirt, scientists are hoping to find answers to some of their oldest questions about life on Earth. \u201cWe\u2019re fairly confident that there\u2019s going to be some of these organic compounds but until we get it back down to earth we won\u2019t know for sure,\u201d Richey said. Getting the samples back to Earth also presents a significant challenge. The spacecraft will take the dirt most of the way back, but it\u2019s not equipped for a landing. Instead, it will eject the capsule four hours above Earth at a speed of 43,450km/h. A parachute will help it descend safely in Utah and, after seven years, researchers will finally be able to get their hands on those bits of dirt from an asteroid. \u201cThis is really an opportunity to bring back a piece of the very early solar system,\u201d Beshore said. \u201cThese samples can be analysed for decades, just like the moon samples returned over 40 years ago are still being analysed using tools we didn\u2019t even know would exist, and of course the same will happen on the samples from Bennu.\u201d The launch takes place Friday morning from Florida\u2019s Cape Canaveral station, aboard one of the United Launch Alliance\u2019s Atlas V rockets. It\u2019s the 13th major NASA mission to use that rocket. Image: ULA/NASA There was some concern that last week\u2019s fire from a SpaceX rocket \u2014 which also took place at the Cape Canaveral station, but from a different launch pad \u2014 might delay the launch. But after a full assessment, NASA said there was no damage to facilities for this launch or any elevated risk from the blazing Falcon 9 rocket. OSIRIS-REx is expected to leave on-schedule in a two-hour launch window starting at 9:05AM AEST. From then, it will be a wait of seven years before we start to get answers about what\u2019s really up on Bennu \u2014 and, perhaps, even how life on our planet really got started.

VI wasn\u2019t long into my tenure at Kotaku Australia; a few months, perhaps. It was the job I\u2019d been working towards since primary school. And yet after the pieces had finally begun to fall into place, I found myself standing on a median strip, in the middle of a six-lane highway, one of the busiest in New South Wales. I found myself standing there, wondering what would happen if I took a step forward into the path of the semi trailer passing by. Obviously, RUOK Day is meant for people like me. Thing is, it\u2019s become the one day of the year I hate more than most. If you didn\u2019t know already, suicide has rapidly become one of Australia\u2019s biggest killers. More than 2800 Australians were officially listed as having died from \u201cintentional self-harm\u201d, the polite way of killing yourself.  If the number seems small, consider this: suicide is now officially the 13th most common cause of death in Australia, and the 10th most common cause of death for males. And that\u2019s the amount of people who succeed. The Black Dog Institute estimates that around 21,000 in New South Wales alone try to kill themselves.  Just imagine how big the figure is for the whole country. Chances are, if you haven\u2019t tried to kill yourself, you know someone who has, or you know someone who knows someone who has. If you\u2019re aged between 15-44, it\u2019s the leading underlying cause of death.  That\u2019s how common place suicide has become.  That\u2019s where things like RUOK Day emerge from. The principle behind RUOK Day is perfectly sound. In 1995, a son found himself growing up without a father. The son: Gavin Larkin, who became the founder of RUOK Day after being diagnosed with lymphoma. Larkin\u2019s father, Barry, recorded some of his thoughts on audio tapes that Australian Story aired a few years ago. Anyone who\u2019s thought about suicide will be pretty familiar with willingness and ease at which your own mind sabotages itself.  \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to just slip into sadness and despair, and a chain of depressing or angry thoughts,\u201d Barry can be heard saying. One of Barry\u2019s surviving sons later said \u201che ended up being isolated, and taking his life\u201d. And that\u2019s the point. If people aren\u2019t isolated, they\u2019re less likely to kill themselves. And that\u2019s the main problem with RUOK Day. A few years ago, in a previous office, someone wandered up to me in the kitchen and without thought, rhyme or reason, asked me if I was OK.  Rather than simply saying, \u201cSure, I\u2019m fine\u201d, as office etiquette so often demands, I answered the question honestly. I really didn\u2019t know if I was OK. Life wasn\u2019t terminal at that very second. But not that long ago, I wandered out to the balcony to hang up the washing and peered over the edge. What would it feel like if I hit the ground, I thought. I was completely fine only seconds before then \u2014 completely happy, in fact.  But that didn\u2019t stop my mind from being sabotaged. Because that\u2019s what it feels like: whenever things feel good, your brain tries to weigh the scales. Maybe that colleague really doesn\u2019t like you. Maybe someone is being deliberately incompetent to ruin your life. Maybe you should step into traffic.  There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to it all. So maybe I wasn\u2019t OK. I really didn\u2019t know. And I said as much. Which is precisely the opposite thing you\u2019re supposed to do. You\u2019re not supposed to answer the question, because that\u2019s not socially acceptable. When RUOK Day rolls around and someone asks you if you\u2019re OK, it\u2019s not to start up a conversation about your mental health. How do you even start a conversation about your own mental health in the middle of an office? And when someone starts, what the hell do you say? What can you say? What RUOK Day has become is an opportunity for people to ask a question. Being reminded of your connections, your friendships, what you have in this world, reduces the impulsion to leave it. But the trick is to make an environment where people feel comfortable talking. The focus should be on getting the story told, not convincing someone to ask a question they\u2019re not prepared to hear the answer for. This isn\u2019t to say that the day, and the foundation behind it, hasn\u2019t been of immense use. A friend on Facebook recently told a story about how they helped a close mate stop himself from \u201cdoing something stupid\u201d after they asked if he was OK.  You can\u2019t put a price on time. But the problem lies in what comes after the question. What happens after you get the response. That\u2019s why the question itself is so painful, almost offensive: because when you answer honestly, the questioner often has no answers.  And they\u2019re not supposed to. That\u2019s what psychologists, doctors, specialist services are for. But these days, even their capacity to help is diminished.  Jennie Hill recently pointed out  how the increased awareness around suicide can actually be detrimental. If support services don\u2019t have the necessary resources to deal with the bottleneck of cases, it ends up feeding into the isolation and loneliness that so often becomes a precursor to suicide. \u201cImagine if we had a day each year when we all went around asking cancer patients if they were \u201cokay\u201d, yet didn\u2019t fund practical medical help for them or give them any hope,\u201d Hill wrote. \u201cThe idea is laughable, yet the analogy is real.\u201d And as someone who feels like they\u2019ve struggled, perhaps not as much as others \u2014 and that\u2019s another problem in and of itself \u2014 that\u2019s the irony of it all.  \u201cThose of us who aren\u2019t sick can pat ourselves on the back that we\u2019ve done something good today, and go on with our lives.\u201d I don\u2019t say this to be glib, or to shame or ostracise those who genuinely want to help. You can\u2019t fix something you don\u2019t understand. But if you\u2019re going to ask someone, particularly without context, whether they\u2019re feeling alright, take it from me. Think about what the reply might be before asking the question.  And there\u2019s always the chance that someone \u2014 a colleague, a close friend, or a loved one \u2014 will end up telling you anyway, whether you\u2019re prepared or not. There\u2019s a word for people in certain jobs and positions most likely to notice when people are at risk of suicide. They\u2019re called gatekeepers. They\u2019re typically people who are on the frontlines, such as nurses, paramedics, outreach workers, but they\u2019re also mothers, fathers, partners, teachers, sporting coaches. According to the Breaking The Silence suicide prevention report, training and informing people in these sorts of roles is one of the best strategies for lowering suicide rates.  But it\u2019s not enough on its own. It\u2019s best applied when included as part of a community-wide initiative, something that increases availability of healthcare, while also reducing the stigma within that community and increasing the capacity for early intervention. Of course, most of these options are dependent on knowing that someone is struggling in the first place. If they don\u2019t talk, if they continue to struggle in silence, then all the services in the world won\u2019t help. And more often than not, healthcare services aren\u2019t helping either. The Black Dog Institute found 40 percent of people who attempted suicide and were admitted to hospital received no medical support afterwards. People who try to end their lives once are the most likely to end their lives for good. And as Lifeline\u2019s report adds, most people who succeed tried to reach out for help: \u000aInternationally, up to 83 percent of individuals who suicide have had contact with a primary care physician within a year of their death and between 50 and 66 percent within a month (Owens et al, 2009; Mann et al., 2005; Luoma, Martin, & Pearson, 2002; Andersen, Andersen, Rosholm, & Gram, 2000).\u000a\u000aAs Goldney (2008) points out \u2026 a common theme among a number of studies maintains that mood disorders have often not been diagnosed in many of the individuals who have died by suicide. In instances where they had been, those people had often not received \u201cadequate treatment for their depressive conditions\u201d (Goldney, 2008, p.28).\u000a Preventing suicide, clearly, takes a collective effort. It\u2019s a community wide approach; it involves your mother, your father, your friends, your colleagues, your workplace, your doctor, your hospital, your hobbies. It\u2019s more than just a question. It\u2019s more than just one answer. It\u2019s an ongoing process that\u2019s bigger than a day; it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s bigger than a simple query over a cup of coffee. What RUOK represents and what it symbolises is nothing short of pure goodwill. But the question needs to change. It\u2019s not about whether I\u2019m OK, or whether your friends are OK. It\u2019s about what you can do when I\u2019m not. Are you prepared to listen? Are you prepared for the answer? And if someone reaches out for help, do they understand what to look for, what to say, what to do? So often, they aren\u2019t. So often, services can\u2019t. That\u2019s why I\u2019m no longer OK with RUOK Day, because it represents a problem that Australia wants to say it\u2019s solving, without fully putting in the measures necessary to fix it. So stop asking if I\u2019m OK. Just encourage me, and others who are struggling, to tell our story. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll be OK, when we feel comfortable enough to speak, to reach out in our own way. I lie about it when I get asked because like you say - who wants to say 'no' in a crowded office with people you're not comfortable with? I've had two mental breakdowns, one of them almost at the stage of me being hospitalized for my own safety. I take medication (or did, I ran out and don't want to ask for time off to see my mental healthcare professional). I'm sure R U OK means well but honestly, I feel (in my workplace at least) the question is asked in jest, almost sarcastically. I made the mistake of admitting I was not OK at work.\u000aNow I don't have a job.\u000aOnce the word got around that I had mental health issues, the management hierarchy couldn't get rid of me quick enough.\u000aSo much for enlightened thinking about mental health. this was such a good article. I actually took the day off work on "R U OK" day so that I didnt have to reply or fake a "yeah im ok" I think it took a lot of guts to write this Alex. But I think you're way off base. Your poor experience does not reflect the positive outcome the day represents to me or to others. I have a lot of experience with suicidal depression. I've been to more funerals for suicides than any other type. I deal with its impacts on a daily basis. I know for a fact that RUOK day has helped people very close to me remember that they can talk to someone. And I know that the existence of such a day creates an opportunity for people to discuss these things--whether personally afflicted or not. And I read Jennie's piece on Medium this morning, and I think she's wrong as well. We don't fix Australia's unwillingness to talk about mental health issues by shutting down opportunities like this. I want to be asked if I'm ok. I want to ask those around me if they're ok. And yes, it's important to do that in a manner and situation that is appropriate and which provides the answerer with an opportunity to respond with 'no' and the discussion that follows. So for me, that means not asking the question on RUOK day necessarily. But I'll ask those people next time the opportunity arises, and I might not have ever thought to do that if it wasn't for the awareness provided by the concept of RUOK day. I think Alex made that point though: it is useful, but it would definitely be more useful if people had a better idea how to approach people. I definitely agree that RUOK is a force for good though. The point isn't to shut it down but for the day to evolve, become something else, something bigger. We're beyond asking the question. I think the national consciousness has reached that point now. Except we're clearly not beyond asking the question. Even comments here show that. It's apparently used as a joke by people in offices who think mental illness is worth joking about. That's not a fault of the day, that's a fault of the national consciousness. So I think the question still needs to be asked. But I think you raise a good point about changing how and where it's asked. I agree @joabyjojo. Perhaps R U OK day is mis-marketed as being about a simple question when in fact it's so much more? But it's not like they don't acknowledge and attempt to educate about the fact it's a bit bigger then an abbreviated sentence - see their website https://www.ruok.org.au/ask-a-mate?_rdr \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 5:45 pm								 the concept is fine, but all I've seen is light hearted attempts to make a joke out of asking RUOK.  I can tell you at my low points, all I will ever say is 'I'm fine',  and this day will not change that.  I applaud the people behind this, because something is better than nothing. I agree to everything you said and can completely relate to your approach. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 2:05 pm								 As someone who was in and out of depression for 16 years I can tell you that I am fully behind and support these days that draw attention to mental health issues. If I had someone ask me this question back then and if this day was as big as it is now when I was going through it, I would have loved to have people ask me.  Even if there isn't infrastructure at the moment to support the calls/questions people have that result from these days, it highlights the fact that these departments/support groups need more funding. Without these days, they have no chance of getting it. Hopefully this changes in the future when the government can see what is the reality of what is happening with our society. Bring on more days like this I say. Society needs to know that this issue is huge and that then hopefully results in the stigma being reduced further and let's the sufferers know that they are not alone and there are those who will help them. Beautifully written and something I agree with. (Had a way less concise rant on Twitter yesterday. :P) Hey mate, I have absolutely no experience with depression other than talking with a close friend who suffers. On the other hand, I'm happy to listen if you ever want to talk at/to somebody and even though you might not be comfortable with me, I'll never actually know who you are so what does it matter, right? Get in touch if you want to chat. -J Nothing more I can add, totally sums up where I'm at with the idea. Very well said Alex AND those above! I can see that it might help some people, but having depression myself and having overheard / seen first hand how some people (including managers / former managers) discuss / gossip about even trivial details about other people certainly prevents me from giving an honest answer when asked "R U OK?" So, so true. Honestly I don't even do the standard "i'm good" for people asking how I am anymore. I'm not a miserable git telling everyone how awful life is, but I just kind of dodge it and ask how they are. Sitting on my break at work surrounded by RUOK posters, but life is hard, posters don't help, and neither does bringing crap to the workplace. Generally when people do offer help, they expect you to improve quickly with their help, otherwise they stop helping. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 4:28 pm								 Hi Alex. It's not hard to hate things and be cynical when you're depressed, nor to fail to see the point of interventions like these. I'm sorry if your colleague was not prepared for your reality, but  the next person to ask might be. I lost a friend to suicide and have had a year or two of wondering if I might join him. But I'm lucky that my circle of friends are practiced with depression (having lost more than one person to that black dog) and had no problem talking to me about it or checking in. It's not that way for everyone though and it's entirely possible that a great many people will have conversations that will save lives, because things like RUOK have made it more normal to do so.  Maybe not your workplace, but somewhere. This is an extract from an email I sent around to my team a few years ago on RUOK Day, which was then (with my permission) circulated throughout our organisation.  The feedback I got from it was pretty incredible. This isn\u2019t for everyone.  One of the problems with asking people if they\u2019re OK is that they may say \u2018No, I\u2019m not.\u2019.  This can be quite confronting for some people, and they may not know what to do.  THIS DOES NOT MAKE YOU A BAD PERSON! It is simply outside your area of experience.  Remember, that by asking someone if they\u2019re OK, you\u2019re not offering to take on the role of their therapist.  If you feel up to it, by all means listen to their problems, even offer advice. There are some tips for this here.  If you don\u2019t, try not to walk away or isolate the person. While the stigma of mental illness is not what it once was, too many people distance themselves from friends who have acknowledged that they\u2019re sick because they don\u2019t know what to do. Suggest they seek professional help \u2013 their GP is the best place to start. Then try to include them in things \u2013 social, professional, whatever \u2013 just as you did before you knew. If you ask me if I\u2019m OK I might burst into tears.  This isn\u2019t a bad thing.  I\u2019m just really happy that you care. Just smile, give me a hug (or, as EEO policy suggests, pat me on the arm between the shoulder and the elbow) and carry on, knowing that you\u2019ve really helped \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 5:20 pm								 I think before people go too much into the shortcomings of 'R U OK Day' they should pop over to the website and have a browse at the recommended approaches and tips and things to think about. Asking "R U OK" is just the first step. It's also listening. It's also exploring further if you think the person is just saying 'OK' without meaning it. It's thinking 'Am I the right person to ask this?'. If people glibly ask others in some sort of token sheep-mentality semi-joking manner, they're not acting in the spirit of the day. Also, it's not just a 'day'. It's a reminder to people that they should feel ok with asking this, and answering this, in a sincere and meaningful day *any day* of the year.  R U OK? should be one of a thousand ways we say to each other 'I'm not sure if there's anything wrong, but we're all in this together, and i'm someone who cares enough not to fake it or ignore it if I think something's not right. If you don't want to talk, that's cool. But if you do, or you think you need help asking for help, that's cool too' R U OK day may not be for you. Maybe find what works. But if it works for even one person, i'm proud to be part of it. I've always said... If you're not prepared to here the horrible truth, don't ask the question. Asking someone if they're OK then staring at them when they say "I feel like shit, I want to kill myself before the end of the week and I really can't see what you or anyone else can do for me that could remotely help", probably has no benefit to anyone.\u000aI think the "Are you OK?" is a useless, feel good exercise for people who want to feel like they care but deep down find depressed people a drain on their inner peace. Cut the bullshit, don't make it a special day, don't skip around asking "Are you OK?" like it gives you browny points for each time you ask. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 10:26 pm								 As a person dealing with fluctuating states of depression, how I am supposed to respond to this question from casual friends or acquaintances when my the people who I consider/ed my nearest and dearest haven't been able to handle it? I applaud the concept, it's far too casual for what could be a such a loaded response, and it's really only asked by do-gooders who, as good intentioned as they are, tend to be the type that you don't want invested in your personal business.  That, and the wider insincerity around the question just makes me want to hide. TL;DR - "I'm fine."

VIt seems we\u2019ve been wrong about giraffes since, well, forever.  Nubian giraffes in Uganda. Image: Julian Fennessy The long-necked, charismatic treetop-munching herbivores you\u2019ll remember from childhood trips to the zoo are not, as biologists long assumed, a single species. In fact, they are four. That is the startling conclusion of a first-of-its-kind genetic analysis of giraffes, which finds that populations from different regions of the African continent are as distinct as polar bears and brown bears. As such, they need to be treated as separate species so that their genetic heritage can be conserved. \u201cThis was definitely a surprise,\u201d Julian Fennessy, co-founder of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation and lead author of the study published today in Current Biology, told Gizmodo. \u201cThese [different species of giraffe] split off one to two million years ago \u2014 that\u2019s huge. It\u2019s much larger than we expected.\u201d Reticulated giraffe is in Samburu NP, Kenya. Image: Julian Fennessy\u000aTo be fair, subtle differences between different groups of giraffes had been noted before. First described in 1758 by the famed taxonomist Linnaeus (who himself had never seen a giraffe in the wild), the animals have been organised in up to eleven subspecies over the years, on the basis of geographic distribution, coat markings, and those funny, fur-covered head nubs called ossicones. For instance, the reticulated giraffe of Somalia, with its polygonal, liver-coloured spots, is easily distinguishable from the Roshchild\u2019s giraffe of Uganda and Kenya, whose patches are less sharply defined. Roshchild\u2019s giraffe, for its part, has similar coat markings to the Masai giraffe of Kenya and Tanzania, but closer inspection of the skull reveals five ossicones instead of the typical three. It was these sorts of observations that prompted Fennessy and his colleagues to see what else they could learn using molecular tools. \u201cThere\u2019s been an increase in private sector and governments sharing of giraffes across regions in recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cMy concern is that we were losing biodiversity. As an ecologist, I wanted to figure out if they were similar or not.\u201d So Fennessy\u2019s Namibia-based organisation partnered with German biologists to conduct the first comprehensive genetic analysis of giraffes. Over the course of nearly seven years, 190 tissue samples were collected from animals across Africa representing the nine currently-recognised subspecies. A suite of nuclear genetic markers and mitochondrial DNA \u2014 often used to distinguish different species \u2014 were subsequently analysed in the lab. Angolan giraffe herd in Damaraland, NW Namibia. Image: Julian Fennessy\u000aThe analysis revealed four highly distinct species that do not mate in the wild. Two of these species, the Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi), and the reticulated giraffe (G. reticulata), correspond to previously-identified subspecies. The other two, the southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffa), and the northern giraffe (G. camelopardalis), encompass several subspecies each. The conservation implications are enormous. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently recognises giraffes (one species) as \u201cleast concern,\u201d a designation that some biologists say diminishes the risks these animals face due to habitat loss, illegal hunting and poaching. Of the four newly proposed species, Fennessy believes that at least three should be placed in a threatened category. For instance, \u201cNorthern giraffe number less than 4,750 individuals in the wild, and reticulated giraffe number less than 8,700 individuals \u2014 as distinct species, it makes them some of the most endangered large mammals in the world,\u201d he said in a statement. Zookeepers cam also make use the new genetic insights, whether their goal is to preserve the biodiversity that exists in nature, or simply to educate the public. In many zoos across the world, different populations of giraffes are routinely hybridised. \u201cOver the years we\u2019ve been saying, look: these animals are different,\u201d Fennessy said. \u201cIf we\u2019re trying to conserve biodiversity, it\u2019s best to keep them separate. Now that we\u2019re proposing four new species, I think there\u2019s even more reason.\u201d [Current Biology] Well, this can fall under the "I learnt something new today" :)

p664
V\u000a\u000a  Name: Proofcam RAC 03\u000aType: Rearview Mirror Video Dashcam\u000aSpecs: Click here for full specs\u000aPrice: £159.99\u000a\u000a \u000aBritish company Proofcam manufactures a wide range of dashcams, including several models for vehicle breakdown service, the RAC. Here we look at the flagship model in the RAC range, the RAC 03. Unlike most dashcams which attach to the windscreen, this one fits over the top of your existing rearview mirror and features a front facing camera.   \u000aDash for dashcams Dashcam sales are accelerating fast. A couple of weeks ago I spoke to a  guy from Halfords at the retailer\u2019s Spring/Summer launch who told me they had seen an 800 per cent increase in sales over the last 12 months. That\u2019s quite incredible. A large reason for their growing popularity it seems is protection. Drivers, especially older drivers, are becoming more aware of insurance scams through articles in papers and online. These include \u2018flash for cash\u2019 scams where a driver will flash you to let you turn in front of him or her, only to then plough into the side of you and claim the insurance, insisting they never flashed to let you go in the first place! Saga magazine which is aimed at the elderly recently wrote about the phenomenon here and it\u2019s clear that older drivers are rushing to protect themselves with these latest, affordable gadgets which will film video footage every time you get in the car. Some dashcams boast two cameras \u2013 one front facing and one rear facing to film out the back of the window \u2013 but the RAC 03 has just one for filming out of the front of the car. Another reason why people invest in dashcams, it seems, is that several insurance companies will offer you money off your car insurance if you have one installed because any footage you do shoot could be used as evidence against another insurance company. All too often insurance companies end up sharing the liability in cases between two drivers simply because there is no evidence one way or another. The rear view mirror dashcam clips on to your existing rear view mirror Setting up the dashcam Whereas the vast majority of the dashcams attach to the windscreen, which obviously makes them a potential target for thieves, the beauty of this Proofcam model is that it is designed to fit over the top of your existing rearview mirror. It\u2019s a very long flat design which makes it suitable for most designs but it may not fit all cars so it\u2019s worth checking before you buy. It fitted over the rear view mirror on my Mercedes C200 OK using the expandable elastic clips supplied, but did require a bit of repositioning in order to make sure that the front facing camera wasn\u2019t obscured by the existing rear view mirror. Another problem I faced was that there wasn\u2019t enough room at the top of the dashcam to plug in the power lead that runs from the device into the cigarette lighter. This meant that I needed to use a different shaped lead which is available from Proofcam as an an optional extra. Although it\u2019s possible to run the lead from the device directly into the cigarette lighter on the dashboard a far neater and more discreet solution is to tuck the lead into the roof of the car and run it around the side of the vehicle. Alternatively Proofcam has a deal with a professional installer  who will do it for you, albeit for an additional charge. Supplied with the dashcam is an 8GB MicroSD card which slots into the top of the device (like most Micro SD cards this is rather fiddly to put in). Alternatively you can insert up to a 64GB Micro SD card which can obviously hold more video footage. The dashcam stores video footage on a loop in 1, 3 or 5 minute loops (you can choose which one you want) wiping off the old footage as the card becomes full. Various video resolutions can be set ranging from 1280 x 720 pixels to 2560 x 1080 pixels. Video images can be displayed on the built in 4.3 inch TFT LCD display or on your computer (PC/Mac) using the Dashcam viewer software (available to download from here). \u000aRecording the road  The dashcam is designed in a way that it automatically switches on as soon as it detects a signal from the car\u2019s electrical system via the cigarette lighter. An image is displayed on the mirrored screen for a brief period before this switches off so that you can see the road behind you using the dashcam as a rearview mirror. This takes a little bit of getting used to as it\u2019s quite a bit darker than a standard rearview mirror. A solid red light shows that the dashcam is charging while a flashing blue light indicates that footage is being recorded onto the MicroSD card. Unfortunately the display isn\u2019t touch screen, but there are four buttons underneath the display where you can access menus for switching the microphone on/off, adjusting video resolution etc (obviously you can\u2019t do any of this while driving). Another thing to note is that the dashcam doesn\u2019t hold its charge for very long so if you disconnect it from the cigarette lighter in order to charge another device such as a mobile phone or tablet it will stop recording after a few minutes. Thanks to built in GPS, the dashcam is able to monitor your vehicle\u2019s speed and you can set a speed limit manually between 20mph and 70mph so that if the set speed is exceeded a warning will sound. Also on board is a speed camera warning service which Proofcam claims will alert you to the presence of several different kinds of speed camera including Static, SPECS (average speed cameras) and Redlight cameras. It also contains a database of mobile camera locations thanks to the users of PocketGPSWorld.com. For those who are worried about their car being bashed in a car park there\u2019s also a Parking Monitor function. Using this mode it\u2019s possible to record collisions even when the vehicle is switched off and parked. In this mode, the file is also automatically kept safe so it can\u2019t be recorded over. However, it\u2019s not possible to capture the footage immediately before the collision. Nor will it capture footage if the car is hit from behind as the camera provided is front facing only. Other features include Forward Collision and Lane Diversion Warning Systems (FCWS and LDWS) which sound an alarm in advance of either a possible forward collision or a diversion from one lane to the next. However, we didn\u2019t test out either of those features for this evaluation. \u000aPlaying back videos and photos Like most dashcams at present, footage is stored on a MicroSD card rather than being transmitted wirelessly via your smartphone. As a result playback isn\u2019t the most straightforward of processes. One way of viewing what\u2019s been shot is to take the MicroSD card out of the device and put it in a Micro SD to SD card adaptor in your computer. Alternatively you can connect the dashcam to your computer (Mac or PC) via the USB lead or watch the footage via the device itself (though of course you will need to connect it to your computer if you want to send it via email to an insurance company.) It\u2019s also possible to hook up the dashcam to your TV set via a Micro HDMI cable (not supplied) if you want to recreate your own version of TV shows like Police Interceptors where they use real dashcam footage! Using the Dashcam viewer software (which you can download from Proofcam\u2019s website here: http://proofcam.com/product-resources/), it\u2019s also possible to analyse the footage you have shot. However, Mac users may have to change their security settings in order to open the software as it comes from a developer which is unknown to Apple! Importing the footage into the Dashcam Viewer software not only allows you to see it within the window but also to add overlays which may be useful either to yourself or an insurance company. This includes precise GPS data, a speedometer and even more data (G-Forces, Altitude etc) which would probably only be useful to a Formula 1 team!\u000a\u000a Using the Dashcam Viewer software you can analyse the footage, complete with map overlays and speed/GPS data Performance Although setting up the Proofcam RAC 03 dashcam was a little tricky, largely because of having to attach it over the existing rearview mirror, once it was set up performance was very good. Video resolution in 1920 x 1080 mode was crystal clear when played through the computer (I will upload some YouTube footage in the next few days). The only slight problem we experienced is that the dashcam didn\u2019t always recognise the speed cameras near where I lived in North London. While sometimes it would warn me when were approaching a speed camera with a warning sound as well as flashing up the speed limit on the screen, on a few occasions it seemed to miss the cameras completely. Also it would be useful to have a wireless feature that enables you to transfer five minutes of video footage into the cloud in order to save having to mess around with cables or with MicroSD cards! \u000aVerdict: There\u2019s no doubt that dashcams are becoming increasingly popular, especially among older people who are worried about \u2018flash for cash\u2019 scams or just wanting to save a few pounds on their car insurance. For those who want the added security of not having a conventional looking camera attached to their windscreen, the Proofcam RAC 03 is a great stealth device, doubling up as a large rear view mirror. If you get the cabling professionally installed too \u2013 something we would definitely recommend \u2013 then you wouldn\u2019t even be able to tell there was a dashcam installed in the car at all.

VLooking for an iPhone 7 plan? Well, look no further. This is our full list of plans from Australia\u2019s major telcos for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, in all storage sizes. Second up with plan pricing for the brand new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is Telstra. Telstra will offer the iPhone 7 from as little as $85 per month on its Small plan with 1GB of data, $550 of calls and unlimited messages. Optus has released its on-contract pricing for the brand new iPhone 7. Optus will offer the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus on a range of plans, starting from as little as $40 per month and a total cost of $68 per month including handset repayment. Vodafone is first out of the gates with its on-contract pricing for the brand new iPhone 7. Vodafone will offer the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus on a range of plans, starting from as little as $40 per month and a total cost of $76 per month including handset repayment. Rounding out the pack of the major four telcos\u2019 iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus plan pricing is Virgin, who will give you an iPhone 7 for as little as $62 a month on the company\u2019s $30 plan \u2014 making it the cheapest iPhone 7 plan available. who the hell gets phones on rip off contracts ? I buy mine out right and go prepay. No being charged  extortionate date rates when you go over your allocation. No paying 2.5k in a phone after 24 months,\u000aWho the hell would buy the 7 anyway ? \u000a									Last edited September 10, 2016 2:07 pm								 who the hell gets phones on rip off contracts ?\u000aMost people. Those people either don't realise, don't care or can't afford to shell out for a handset up front and then go pre or post-paid on SIM-only. who the hell gets phones on rip off contracts ? I buy mine out right and go prepay. No being charged extortionate date rates when you go over your allocation. No paying 2.5k in a phone after 24 months,Or they've done the math and it makes sense in their particular situation. Take mine for example: 128gb iPhone 7 is $1,229 outright My Telstra plan: $113/month including 10gb of data and free apple music (normally $12 a month) I use Telstra's "new phone feeling" to upgrade to the new iPhone every 12 months for a fee of $149 The math:\u000a$113 x 12months = $1,356\u000aPlus new phone feeling = $149\u000aMinus 12 months of Apple Music = -$144 Total = $1361 That means i'm paying $127 per year on top of the retail value of the phone, for unlimited texts, calls and 120gb of data.  Not bad really... \u000a									Last edited September 10, 2016 9:00 pm								 If you do the math, these plans don't work out to be any more expensive than buying your phone outright. I've been buying phones outright for years, but just got my first one on contract. Compared to my existing $40 Optus plan, it'll work out to around $1200 extra over the life of my plan to get a 128gb iPhone 7 on contract. That's actually less than the cost of it outright. The problem is you are paying more than the 'phone repayment' for the phone. A simple example is the Optus $40 plan with the Iphone 7 is $40+$28. The $40 pan only includes 1gb of data.  Where the $40 sim only plan includes 8gb of data. Guess it depends how much your data's worth.

p668
VInbox by Gmail has been around for almost two years, and while it continues to exist alongside Gmail, it\u2019s easy to see that Google engineers see Inbox as the email app of the future. New features are being added on a regular basis, and with each one, it\u2019s slowly becoming smarter and easier to use. Here are five reasons you should consider switching to Inbox right now.\u000a Recently added features bring Trello and GitHub integration to Inbox, which it can parse information inside messages sent from those services and give you automatic alerts rather than a standard \u2018new email\u2019 update. It works in the same way that Inbox scans hotel bookings for key details. It works with things like Google Alerts and Google Drive too, so you can finally insert Drive links directly into emails and skip the step of adding the file as an attachment. The list of supported services is fairly sparse right now, but it\u2019s easy to see how Google could expand type of integration, making more of your email updates smart, so you get the key information at a glance. Email newsletters are back in fashion (we have one) and Inbox deals with them in a clever way, parsing the links inside to give you a quick summary. You can tap on one or more of the links or just ignore them completely. You can still open the whole newsletter if you want more information, but this is another prime example of Inbox making it easier to get through lots of email. Once you\u2019re done with a particular newsletter, it\u2019s minimized in the email list to take up less space. As with anything else in the Inbox app, you can swipe on a newsletter to archive or snooze it. One key feature Inbox has that Gmail doesn\u2019t is smart replies. Quick, AI-powered responses to your contacts to help you power through your inbox and spend less time composing replies. Open up any thread you\u2019re planning to respond to, and you\u2019ll see the generated quick replies appear in blue boxes at the foot of the screen. Google engineers recently added emoji to the list of possible replies too. You still have the option to reply like a normal human being if you want, and the feature is now available on the web as well as mobile. You can use Gmail as a read-it-later service and to do list, but Inbox is geared up more specifically for these type oftasks. Online articles can be saved to Inbox on Android or iOS, provided Inbox is installed, and on the web through an official Chrome extension. Meanwhile the ability to add reminders is right next to the option to compose a new email (use the large red plus icon on mobile or the web). To dos can be associated with a time and even a place. The reminders sync neatly to Google Now too, so you can access them without having to go into Inbox each time. The ability to snooze emails isn\u2019t available in Gmail, and the option in Inbox has been getting more and more advanced over time. If the app detects a date and time in the email you\u2019re snoozing, for example, that comes up as a snooze suggestion. It works for package tracking, hotel and flight reservations, invites from Google Calendar and more, letting you forget about an email until you really need it. What\u2019s more, you can customise snooze times and days for morning, afternoon and evening through the app settings. This story originally appeared on Gizmodo Thanks for this, I'd been aware of Inbox for a while, but today I've switched to it. Not yet a "eureka !" moment, but it looks like it'll grow on me.\u000aUntil Google pull the plug on it I guess. Inbox is great, I reckon.  Snoozing is a great feature and it's easy to mark a bunch of unimportant emails done in one go. Inbox sucks at managing attachments compared to Gmail though (save to/import from Drive, etc). They need to import that function ASAP These comments refer to the Windows version. As far as I know (please correct me if I'm wrong): * You can't display Labels. You can activate "Bundle messages in Inbox" based on Label but it doesn't show me the "in your face" coloured labels I have setup for emails from Gcalendar, Friends, Bank, Tenants, etc. * It doesn't display date and time email was received / sent. * You can't easily create Filters, eg it doesn't even pickup the From address when you click on "Create new", and the options available are restricted to From, To, Subject, Includes, Excludes. It doesn't give you Attachment, Chat and Size options. * It doesn't have a Preview pane. I don't use this in Gmail so the lack of this feature doesn't bother me but it is important for several of my clients. * The Settings are "hidden" at the bottom of the left hand panel, not always displayed at the top as they are in Gmail. In the Android version of Gmail I have setup distinctive sounds for various Labels so I know when emails arrive from Partner, Friends, etc. I don't recall whether you can do this in the Android version of Inbox because I didn't have it on my phone for very long. I was so unimpressed by Inbox not being able to display Labels or dates that I uninstalled it very soon after I installed it. It's one of the most useless email clients I have used. I'm not sold by any of these features.

V\u000a\u000aHardly a day goes by without a new tech company looking for crowdfunding from Kickstarter or Indiegogo. But here\u2019s one that caught our eye. Billed as the world\u2019s first wearable private cloud it\u2019s essentially a watch that can store all your files from various devices without having to be connected to the internet. Potentially perfect for those who are worried about their devices being stolen or their data being lost \u2013 as well as government officials who leave their laptops and iPads on the train \u2013 ReVault claims to be a new type of storage that gives you the smartness and convenience of the public cloud, and the security of local storage. With ReVault you can store files locally and access them at the speed of a local network. ReVault connects to your devices using WiFi and Bluetooth and you can set it up to auto-backup and auto-synchronize your files across your devices. Wearable so that you can easily carry your files wherever you go at all times, it comes in sizes of 32GB and 128GB. The ReVault has been designed to be private, secure and protected, functioning offline out of the reach of crackers, governments and big corporations. Only trusted devices can connect to ReVault with the data stored on the device encrypted using AES-256. On top of that you can also choose to password protect your app using single, or 2-factor authentication. ReVault provides a number of screen faces, that you can choose between. You can either select a face for your private cloud data, or a digital or analogue clock. There are also hybrid faces displaying both. Developers will also be able to create their own custom faces using the ReVault API. At the time of writing, ReVault has attracted around $51,000 of its $65,000 funding goal with US backers able to get an \u2018early bird deal\u2019 of $169 on the 32GB model and $269 on the 128GB model.

V\u000a\u000aIf you don\u2019t want to get your mobile phone nicked then perhaps avoid Leeds, Belfast and London! For these three places top the list of the UK towns and cities where people are most likely to get their mobile phones and tablets stolen. According to new claims data from the specialist gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble, almost three in 10 (28.6%) claims received from smartphone and tablet owners in Leeds and 11.9% of claims from Belfast are for theft \u2013 higher than any other locations in a list of the UK\u2019s 35 biggest towns and cities. In third place is London, where 11.3% of all claims are for theft. Located close to the UK\u2019s mobile and tablet theft hotspot of Leeds are Preston (10.7%), Salford (9.1%) and Bradford (8.8%) which all feature in the UK top ten, each with around one in 10 claims for theft. Swansea residents are safest from mobile and tablet thieves, with just 1.6% of total claims for theft \u2013 followed by Newcastle (1.8%), Derby (2.7%) and Wolverhampton (2.9%). A survey by Protect Your Bubble of mobile theft victims and their families revealed that the average stolen phone is worth £206, while almost a quarter (24%) lose handsets worth upwards of £300 to thieves. More than half (53%) of mobiles are stolen whilst unattended by the owner \u2013 13% of which are locked away \u2013 with pubs and bars (25%) being the most common theft hotspots, followed by people\u2019s workplaces (14%). Almost half (47%) of stolen mobiles are pinched from individuals. Of these, more than a quarter (26%) are stolen from coat pockets, 12% are snatched from people\u2019s hands, 12% are stolen from back trouser pockets, and 11% are taken from front trouser pockets. You are most likely to have a phone stolen from your person while walking down the street (16%), or whilst shopping (13%), or on a bus (11%) or train (11%). Those aged between 16 and 24 years old are also more likely to have their handsets stolen, as revealed in the table below, which shows the age of mobile theft victims. Says Stephen Ebbett, global director of Protect Your Bubble: \u201cThere are cities where mobile and tablet thefts spike well above average, but incidences of theft are actually dropping year on year. Only 6% of the claims we received in this six-month period were for thefts, down from 9% the year before, and down from 11% two years ago. The police have improved preventative measures, and gadget owners are increasingly cautious about when and where they use their mobiles in public.\u201d UK Town/City % Mobile & Tablet Theft Claims Oct 2014 \u2013 Mar 2015 1 Leeds 28.6% 2 Belfast 11.9% 3 London 11.3% 4 Preston 10.7% 5 Salford 9.1% 6 Bradford 8.8% 7 Brighton 7.8% 8 Milton Keynes 7.6% 9 Manchester 7.2% 10 Northampton 7.0% 11 Bristol 6.8% 12= Plymouth 6.7% 12= Birmingham 6.7% 14 Reading 6.6% 15 Sheffield 6.57% 16 Luton 6.56% 17 Nottingham 6.4% 18 Southampton 6.2% 19 Leicester 6.18% 20 Sunderland 5.7% 21 Coventry 5.6% 22 Swindon 5.3% 23 Hull 5.1% 24 Glasgow 4.81% 25 Portsmouth 4.76% 26 Liverpool 4.4% 27 Stoke-on-Trent 4.3% 28 Cardiff 4.2% 29 Aberdeen 4.0% 30 Edinburgh 3.9% 31 Wakefield 3.1% 32 Wolverhampton 2.9% 33 Derby 2.7% 34 Newcastle 1.8% 35 Swansea 1.6% UK 6.4%   16-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55+ Stolen in past 12 months 20.4% 8.3% 14.3% 10.7% 8.6% Stolen in past 2 years 59.2% 55.3% 57.1% 49.6% 37.5% Stolen more than 2 years ago 20.4% 36.4% 28.6% 39.7% 53.9% Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VIt\u2019s not always easy to stay one step ahead of the vanishing storage space on your smartphone, and suddenly finding yourself without any available room can prevent you from snapping new pictures, syncing playlists and more. Here are the easiest and quickest ways to get some breathing room again.  We\u2019re not intending this to be a comprehensive list (we haven\u2019t mentioned deleting movies and TV shows you\u2019ve saved to your phone for instance) but rather a collection of space-saving tips you might not immediately think about. Been travelling around remote parts of the world and caching offline maps in advance? It\u2019s a neat feature to have but it can gobble up gigabytes of room on your handset if you\u2019ve got half the country saved to your local storage. This isn\u2019t a solution for Apple Maps \u2014 which manages offline caching automatically \u2014 but you can try it for Google Maps and Here Maps. In Google Maps, go to Offline areas from the main app menu, tap on an area and you\u2019ll get the option to delete it from your phone. To stop this happening in the future, you can set offline areas to automatically erase themselves after 30 days: from the same Offline areas screen, tap the gear icon to turn automatic updates off. If you\u2019re using a different app, check the offline cache \u2014 in the case of the Here Maps for Android and iOS, it\u2019s behind Download maps on the main app menu, and you can simply tap any of the relevant trash icons (Android) or swipe left (iOS) to delete a map. Maybe your love for taking dozens of post-rock albums on the go with you is one of the reasons behind your storage woes. If so a quick clear-out can help. In Spotify, go to Your Library from the main app menu (or the navigation tab) and the playlists you\u2019ve synced are in green \u2014 tap on any one and untick the offline toggle switch to erase its contents from your device. (You might not get back all the space straight away \u2014 Spotify seems to keep the tracks cached for a little while just in case you made a mistake.) In Google Play Music, you can go to Manage downloads from Settings on the main app menu to see tracks actually on your device. Tap the orange tick next to any playlist, album or song to remove it from your phone. In Apple Music, there\u2019s a handy Downloaded Music entry in the Music section of the Settings app on iOS that you can use to delete cached tracks. No such luck on Android, where you have to go to My Music from the main app menu, then tap Artists, then choose Only Downloaded Music to see locally stored songs. In Spotify, you can also reduce the quality of cached tracks to free up some room: the option is in the app settings under Music Quality (Android) or behind the Streaming Quality menu in the app settings (iOS). This can be a big one, particularly if you\u2019re fond of capturing your daily exploits with 4K video clips. Obviously you can head into your gallery app of choice and just delete a raft of images and clips, but you\u2019re probably going to want to hold on to most of them. Google Photos for Android handles this pretty well right now. There\u2019s a Free up device storage option on the main app menu that looks for pictures and videos that have already been sent to the cloud and deletes the local copies. On Android, you can do this manually too, by going to Device folders from the app menu, selecting a group of pictures, tapping the three dots on the menu bar and choosing Delete device copy. Of course check your backup settings \u2014 Google Photos lets you choose between storing originals and resized copies in the cloud, so only delete the local copies if you\u2019re happy with the arrangement you\u2019ve set up. On Apple\u2019s Photos app in iOS it\u2019s a bit trickier to delete local copies of files while keeping the iCloud backups (the apps are specifically set up to keep everything in sync). The only simple solution is to use Apple\u2019s own automatic Optimise iPhone Storage option from the Photos & Camera menu in Settings \u2014 this uses low-res copies on your phone when space is limited, while keeping the originals available in the cloud. Have you been downloading large files from the web and forgetting all about them? Stock Android helpfully provides a Downloads app right in the main app drawer, so you can quickly check what you\u2019ve got in there and erase anything you don\u2019t need anymore. iOS, as you might know, doesn\u2019t let you do anything as dangerous as download files. Saved photos are in your Photos app, but that\u2019s about it. You can clear the website and history data from your mobile browsers too, on Android and iOS, but the storage space savings are unlikely to be significant. Uninstalling apps can remove some space on your phone, but to really clear the decks you need to pick apps of a substantial size \u2014 and games are often the worst culprits as far as taking up room on your device goes. Before removing any title it\u2019s important to double-check what happens to any saved games you\u2019ve built up, but if they\u2019re in a safe place in the cloud (or you just don\u2019t want them), then erasing games you\u2019re no longer playing can be a real space saver. If you\u2019re happy that you won\u2019t be deleting anything important that you won\u2019t be able to get back, go ahead and remove a few games. On Android you can see how much room each game takes up by going into Storage from Settings and tapping on Apps. On iOS, from Settings choose General, Storage & iCloud Usage and Manage Storage. So the way to free up space is to delete stuff?...GENIUS! Here is another (less obvious) way... Go to the iTunes Store and select a movie that is a lot larger than the space you have on your phone eg. Lord Of The Rings in HD tend to work for me since its about 8.5gb and I only have 2gb left usually. Select RENT MOVIE. Then wait until you are told that you don't have enough space on your phone.  After a short while (maybe a minute) check how much space you have on your phone... magically, you should have more room! Which, is nothing more than a way of forcing Apple to do the deleting for you?... GENIUS! Thanks troll...now, back into your cave! my phone has the option to move all the above to the sd-card thus freeing up gigs, of course it isn't an isheep phone.... Guys!\u000aI was successfully able to use a similar method to free up space on my PC and external hard drives. A bit of tweaking involved but essentially you want to delete items to make the memory rewritable.... I jusy kept buying terrabyte after terrabyte of external devices but this has changed my life and will save me serious $$$.

p676
VThe theme of Huawei\u2019s Connect 2016 conference in Shanghai, China, is \u2018Shape the cloud\u2019. Certainly Huawei, an IT and communications technology provider, is becoming a serious player in the cloud space. But despite having the capabilities to launch its own public cloud service, it has chosen to stay behind the scenes, providing technology to power other people\u2019s clouds instead. Huawei explains why it\u2019s not interested in becoming the next Amazon Web Service (AWS).  If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s evident from the Huawei Connect conference, it\u2019s that the company is heavily invested in cloud. Executives and customers took to the stage, extolling the transformative powers of the cloud and how that would affect all enterprises. This story isn\u2019t particularly new. Cloud has been around for long enough and we\u2019ve heard all the spiel about it. What was of interest was learning about the suite of cloud technologies Huawei possesses and how intimately it has worked with telcos around the world to build their own public and private cloud services. Huawei is fervent in acquiring partners and customers, enabling them to build their very own cloud. That\u2019s part of Huawei\u2019s strategy outside of its China, its home turf; to partner with telco providers that want to get into the public cloud business. It makes sense given that telco providers have infrastructure already in place across their respective countries to move data around. However, in China, Huawei launched its own enterprise public cloud service, proving it has the capabilities to be an operator in this space on its own. So the question on many people\u2019s minds, including myself, was whether Huawei has any ambitions to expand its public cloud operations globally. I asked Huawei acting CEO Ken Hu about this at a press conference at Huawei Connect. \u201cThe cloud era has a couple of characteristics; one is the market size is enormous. Secondly, there are many ways of entering this market,\u201d he said through an interpreter. \u201c\u2026 I think Huawei has some unique advantages, which is we can work together with our partners, leveraging Huawei\u2019s innovation capabilities and technical expertise, to realise value in business strategies and processes for industry verticals and enterprises to come up with the best solutions for them. This is something that Huawei has not seen other companies do, Hu added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a challenge to build cloud itself; the bigger challenge lies in operation and service.\u201d Huawei Carrier Business Group president said in his presentation at Huawei Connect. \u201cThe cloud business is not just about building cloud but also translating cloud into business value.\u201d Cost is likely to be a factor against Huawei if it ever had ambitions to become a public cloud juggernaut like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or, closer to home, Alibaba. Datacentres will need to be built, fibre will need to be laid and it will need to pay for internet transit (which doesn\u2019t come cheap, especially Down Under). Huawei is a rich company, but it\u2019s not Amazon-level rich. There\u2019s also the matter of trust. Data sovereignty is still a big issue for many enterprises and there is an increasing level of mistrust in Governments across the globe trying to access data stored by cloud providers. Huawei, which had been suspected of having close ties with the Chinese Government, has experienced mistrust from the US and the Australian Government. But with its rapid growth in the past few years and its push into the consumer handset market, Huawei\u2019s image has softened up quite a bit in recent times. Regardless of whether Huawei can or cannot do it, for now, the company is staying out of the public cloud game in foreign markets. \u201cOur strength lies very much in industry cloud \u2014 deep understanding about industry. Without that deep knowledge, it\u2019s going to be impossible to develop very relevant industry clouds,\u201d Huawei deputy chairman and rotating CEO Eric Xu said at a press conference. \u201cFrom the time we stepped into the enterprise business several years ago\u2026 we have been engaging with enterprises to provide products and services to them. Over many years, we have developed deep understanding of industry verticals and enterprises. \u201cI believe that knowledge is deeper on our side versus international companies. The effort is still ongoing. Therefore, we want to focus on the areas we are good at and we will focus on industry clouds, how we help industries to embark on this journey of digital transformation.\u201d Spandas Lui travelled to Shanghai, China, as a guest of Huawei.

VVideo: Before I happened upon this video, I would have assumed that a crab would devour its meal haphazardly, primitively. Apologies for misjudging. Turns out crustaceans, much like stars, are just like us! Or at least they enjoy their food with the endearing precociousness of a human toddler.\u000a\u000aLuckily, the crab owners of the world have blessed us with many a YouTube video of the beloved shellfish gently picking at some popular delicacies. May I interest you in a crab consuming an onion ring with grace and civility?  Or some beef?  These videos serve as a reminder that even the most unexpected creatures can be cute as hell. Moreover, follow the crab\u2019s example. Slow down and enjoy your food. Soak up the goodness with poise and patience. What a shitty life. Forced to listen to shitty Black Eyed Peas and the sound of a very loud clock while being videotaped eating your food. And by human food, you mean food right? Crabs will eat anything, including humans. I only feed my crab cocaine..... and crab XD

VAs an actress, Majel Barrett\u2019s most recognisable role didn\u2019t have her actually appear on camera. The wife of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek\u2019s creator, provided the voice of the ship\u2019s computer on The Next Generation and subsequent films and TV series. And although Barrett passed away in 2008, her voice may live on in future Trek series and possibly also your smartphone.\u000a\u000aAccording to a tweet posted to the @Roddenberry Twitter account, before she had passed in 2008, Majel\u2019s voice had been recorded phonetically. That allows the producers of future series and movies, like the upcoming Star Trek: Discovery, to re-assemble those individual syllables to say anything in the actress\u2019 voice. Majel might be no longer with us, but she\u2019ll live on through the fictional Star Trek LCARS operating system. In addition to the new series, it seems like the Star Trek producers are also interested in putting Majel\u2019s voice on your smartphone. At the moment, getting a custom voice for Siri onto your iPhone requires you to jump through some less-than-Apple-approved hoops. But one day the company could allow for third-party voices, downloadable through the iTunes App Store, the same way it has done with keyboards. Once that happens, why would you want anything other than the voice of the Enterprise\u2019s computer answering you? [Twitter \u2013 Roddenberry via Chip Chick] Yeah, that won't be creepy or anything.

VThe Most Magical Place on Earth has started scanning the fingers of three-year-olds in an effort to prevent ticket fraud, because you can never be too careful about tiny babies that have only just started communicating properly.\u000a\u000aImage: Getty The Orlando Sentinel reports that children between the ages of three and nine will now have their fingers scanned when they enter Walt Disney World and its theme parks, a practice already in use for guests 10 and older. A Disney spokesperson told WESH.com that the new policy, which apparently went into effect in August, \u201censures a seamless entry experience for our guests, helps protect guests from someone else using their ticket and reduces ticket fraud\u201d. Previously, there were no safeguards in place to prevent ticket swapping between kids under 10. It doesn\u2019t appear that the policy is mandatory \u2014 according to the Sentinel, parents can use their own fingers in place of their children\u2019s, and WESH.com notes that people who don\u2019t want Disney to scan their digits can \u201cvisit guest relations\u201d. The AP reports that Disney\u2019s scanner use has been in place for over a decade. It supposedly uses something called \u201cfinger geometry\u201d, or \u201cpictures of several points on people\u2019s fingers\u201d. Between this and the park\u2019s exploration of \u201cfoot tracking\u201d \u2014 taking photos of guests\u2019 feet in order to \u201ccustomise\u201d the park experience \u2014 Disney World is sure on track for its transformation into a dystopian wonderland.

VRacing your Hot Wheels cars usually requires a good imagination, a makeshift track and a lot of DIY sound effects. But with the new Hot Wheels AI race system, you can finally race your friends, or a computer opponent, on a real track, without needing a smartphone \u2014 or a licence.\u000a A bit larger than the Hot Wheel cars you grew up with. You can think of the Hot Wheels AI race system as an updated version of the slot cars many of us grew up with, except it\u2019s better in so many ways. The slotted track has been replaced with flat modular track sections that can be configured in over 40 different race layouts, and the larger racers \u2014 measuring in at 1/32-scale \u2014 can now be steered back and forth to help overtake an opponent. It\u2019s no longer just a drag race. Drivers steer their own vehicles, but track-reading sensors help ensure you always stay in the race. That said, the advantage of slot cars was that not being able to steer your racer meant it was also impossible to steer off course. Hot Wheels AI works the same way, but instead of a guide pin on the bottom of the two included cars, there\u2019s a sensor that reads a coloured pattern printed on the track sections, which ensure your vehicle always stays in the race. But the AI that helps keep your vehicle in competition and on the track can also be dialled back to increase the challenge. No touchscreen driving here, Hot Wheels AI includes controllers for each vehicle. Hot Wheels AI is reminiscent of the Anki Overdrive race sets that also use sensor-assisted vehicles to make it easier to stay on track. But instead of having drivers steer with finicky touchscreen controls via a smartphone or tablet app, the Hot Wheels AI set includes two dedicated RC controllers, with analogue joysticks and triggers for precise steering and acceleration. And when you get tired of racing on the track you\u2019ve built, or don\u2019t have room for a huge race layout, the cars can be driven around anywhere, just like regular RC toys. Enrage your friends while racing by triggering rechargeable hazards. Other race modes include Autodrive where up to four cars can navigate the track all on their own; Practice mode, in which novice drivers can get a feel for a new layout, or attempt to best their previous best time around a track; and Championship mode where you can race up to three other human or computer players. To make things even more interesting in competition, each driver also has access to rechargeable race hazards that can be used to hinder and disable opponents, or send them flying off the track. Hot Wheels AI will be available in the US closer to the holidays for $US100 ($130), though Australian pricing and release date have not yet been confirmed. In the US, however, it comes in at $US50 ($65) cheaper than the Anki Overdrive Starter Kit, and that includes the wireless controllers for both of the bundled vehicles. Racing with physical controls, instead of a touchscreen, feels more natural, and trading paint with your competitor during a race is even more satisfying with these larger racers \u2014 and safer than trying the same thing with your minivan. [Hot Wheels] When the headline read "Minds of Their Own", surely you didn't think most people would assume that meant "It has a small computer to help it drive"? \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 8:15 pm								 The thing that has always annoyed me with slot cars is that their speed isn't scaled (relatively they travel at ~500kmh). Are the HotWheels cars racing at appropriate speeds? so that cornering and overtaking happens like it would on a video game, or is it all twitch controlled? As it happens Scalectrix has got new tech, allowing for race lines and lane change. But the things travel so quickly on such a tight track that the AI needs to handle it as the human can't react fast enough. The end result being the human is simply an observer who presses a go button...\u000aIf I want that I may as well use Tamya Mini 4WD's and forgo the chips.

VThis episode should have never worked. It was a one-off, inconsequential story about characters we\u2019ve never seen before nor would ever see again. It had no battles, no enemies, no star trekking of any kind. And yet, \u201cThe Inner Light\u201d from Star Trek: The Next Generation lives on; not just as one of the best episodes of Star Trek, but as one of the finest pieces of modern television. And I\u2019m not the only one who thinks so.  We talked to writer Morgan Gendel, and stars Margot Rose and Daniel Stewart (Patrick Stewart\u2019s real-life son) about the episode, which not only tops most Star Trek best episode lists, but also won the 1993 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the first television show to do so since Star Trek: The Original Series won for \u201cThe City on the Edge of Forever.\u201d Airing during the show\u2019s fifth season, \u201cThe Inner Light\u201d is your classic \u201cthe road not taken\u201d story. At the beginning of the episode, Captain Jean-Luc Picard is hit with a probe beam that transports him to another reality. In it, he\u2019s an iron weaver named Kamin, living on a dying planet called Kataan with his wife, Eline. Most of the story takes place over the course of Kamin/Picard\u2019s life. At first, he\u2019s scared and suspicious, yearning to get back to his former life as a starship captain. As the years progress, he accepts and embraces his new reality, starting a family, integrating into the community, and living a rich, full life that spans decades. In the final moments, it\u2019s revealed that Kataan (dead for over 1,000 years) built the probe so that one person could live as one of them and tell their story. Picard lived 40 years in less than half an hour, and he ends up alone. \u201cI\u2019m amazed they let me do this episode as I ended up writing it, because it\u2019s so unbelievably, heartbreakingly sad,\u201d Gendel said. \u201cPicard did have a wife, he did have children, he did have a family and they\u2019re all fucking dead.\u201d It wasn\u2019t actually the original story Gendel sent to Star Trek. A freelance writer at the time, he first pitched a story about an advertising blimp that would transmit experiences into someone\u2019s brain. In it, Picard would envision being on an island with Commander Riker and Ensign Ro Laren, and a love triangle would ensue. Gendel told me the story evolved into Picard\u2019s solo journey over time, after some rejections and rewrites. He got called in five times before they moved forward with the script. Similarly, it actually took eight tries for Margot Rose to get a part on Star Trek: The Next Generation before she finally got the role of Eline. Rose said she kept getting called in for auditions, but none of the parts worked out. Still, she told me she\u2019s glad it ended up being Eline, calling it one of her proudest roles as an actor. \u201cI never in a million years could\u2019ve asked for a better part,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the best part I ever got to play on television. I\u2019ve gotten to play some great parts, but it was the penultimate.\u201d Rose added what she loved most about the part was Eline\u2019s genuine sincerity, what she described as \u201cguileless.\u201d Eline was never mysterious, cunning, or had something up her sleeve. She was just a woman in love with a man who seemed to be going crazy, talking about another life. \u201cHe\u2019s her husband, and she\u2019s thunderstruck, let\u2019s say, that he\u2019s behaving the way he is. And she adores him, and it\u2019s a little bit, it\u2019s not just unnerving\u2026 it\u2019s horrible for her because she adores him,\u201d Rose said. Kamin/Picard\u2019s children and grandchildren were just as guileless in their portrayal, partly because one of the children was actually Picard\u2019s real-life son. Daniel Stewart explained how The Next Generation was his first major role as an actor, and he was terrified not only for himself, but also because he was representing his father, in a way. He\u2019s proud of the episode but doesn\u2019t like watching his performance, saying he looks like a \u201cdeer in the headlights.\u201d (The pair have since worked together on several projects, including Patrick Stewart\u2019s show Blunt Talk, where he also plays his son.) Daniels said the tense scene between Batai and Kamin, where he drops school to focus on his music, reminds him of his family talks about becoming an actor. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I clocked it at the time, but I was very determined to act as a teenager. And my parents were quite keen that I shouldn\u2019t. I had to really prove to my dad that I wanted it,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cHe once told me that to make it in this business \u2026 unless you had an enormous drive and commitment, you would never succeed. I had to prove to him that I had that.\u201d Gendel, Rose, and Daniel Stewart unanimously agree that the glue that holds the entire episode together is Patrick Stewart\u2019s performance. His portrayal of Kamin was not only genuine, but it also deepened our understanding of Picard as a person. For many of us, Star Trek is the ultimate escape, a fantasy world where we can pretend we\u2019re the brave starship captain. Picard\u2019s dream life is a quiet, subdued one, with a wife and children, and by the end he loses it all. That\u2019s pretty messed up. But sadly, the series doesn\u2019t really explore this beyond the end credits. At the end of the episode, Picard wakes up, back in his reality. His wife died before his very eyes. His children are gone, along with the life he spent decades building and making his own, but he doesn\u2019t really address it again. There are references to his experience, like in the season six episode \u201cLessons,\u201d but it\u2019s never really given the gravity it deserves. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a gravesite,\u201d Gendel said. \u201cHe\u2019s just stuck alone carrying the burden of this.\u201d In truth, the only truly lingering proof that \u201cThe Inner Light\u201d happened to Picard at all is his flute. Gendel said when he first brought up the flute in the writers\u2019 room, someone actually laughed. They later reconsidered, and rightly so, because it\u2019s now one of the show\u2019s most iconic symbols. It\u2019s been featured and mentioned several times over the series, and the melody got a full orchestral treatment. Daniel Stewart said he originally learned to play the song by composer Jay Chattaway, but he never got the chance to do it onscreen. His dad did, though, even if didn\u2019t quite master the melody. \u201cI spent hours learning that bloody tune on the tin whistle,\u201d Daniel Stewart said. \u201cThen he gets to play it at the end and he\u2019s basically making it up. Fingers all over the place. And there it is forever. One of the most iconic moments in the series. Typical.\u201d The episode also had a lasting impact on Star Trek as a whole. As Gendel put it, every show that followed had its own \u201cInner Light\u201d episode. Voyager had \u201cMemorial.\u201d Deep Space Nine\u2018s version, \u201cHard Time,\u201d actually featured Rose as Rinn (seen above), the alien who induces Miles O\u2019Brien\u2019s virtual 20-year prison sentence. Rose said she doesn\u2019t know if she was cast on purpose, to connect the two episodes together, but she thinks that would be cool if true. Gendel remembers a time at a Star Trek convention where he met a former Hell\u2019s Angel who was inspired to change his life after watching the episode, and now has a family of his own. \u201cThis was a guy who was on one path, and realised he could change it and pick another path,\u201d Gendel said. As it turns out, \u201cThe Inner Light\u201d almost had a sequel. Gendel pitched a follow-up episode, where Picard helps out a group of Kataan survivors, including his wife Eline. It would have explained the technology behind the probe beam, and given Picard some closure from his decades-long experience. The story was rejected, so Gendel later turned it into a fan comic called The Outer Light, seen above. But \u201cThe Inner Light\u201d still works on its own, and works beautifully. Rose, who\u2019s accumulated dozens of acting credits over the years, said she still gets emotional whenever she watches the episode. \u201cI literally have to tell you the truth, I can watch it and I\u2019m brought to tears myself,\u201d she said. \u201cNot because it\u2019s me, but because I think it\u2019s really good. And I\u2019m really moved by it, and I\u2019m really proud to have been part of it.\u201d I love all the Star Trek posts this week! One of my favorite Star Trek episodes of all time.  I think the only one I like better is Voyager S6E12 "Blink of an Eye"

VImage: AP Photo/Joshua Replogle\u000aUntil Hermine blew through the Florida Panhandle and up into Georgia, Florida had experienced a pleasant, hurricane-free few years. In fact, as The Weather Channel noted, Florida went nearly eleven years without a single hurricane making landfall.  The last hurricane to set foot in Florida was Hurricane Wilma, a Category 3 storm that made landfall in south Florida back on October 24, 2005. Since then 68 Atlantic-based hurricanes have skipped the Sunshine State \u2014 more than twice the previous record of hurricanes. 66 Atlantic hurricanes have occurred since the last to hit FL (Wilma-2005) \u2013 twice the previous record of 33 between David-1979 & Elena-1985 \u2014 Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) May 10, 2016  That\u2019s alarming as, according to the National Hurricane Center, 40-per cent of Atlantic and Gulf-based hurricanes from 1851-2010 affected Florida. The state has more coastline than any other state touching the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic, so the odds were never in Florida\u2019s favour. Yet there\u2019s no precise reason why Florida\u2019s hurricane drought lasted so long. Each case of a hurricane skipping the state was entirely unique. While the hurricane drought lasted a record shattering 11 years, Florida was not without its storms. Nine different tropical storms have touched down in Florida sense Hurricane Wilma.

V Video: GoPro has been working in its Karma camera drone in secret for years, and it\u2019s very, very close to becoming a real thing. If you like drones, and if you like silky-smooth, crystal-clear video, then this short teaser clip should get you hyped. Any concrete information on the GoPro Karma is very light on the ground at the moment, and this video shares just about as much information as we\u2019ve ever had \u2014 including the date at which the drone will be unveiled. On September 19th (US time, presumably, so probably the morning of the 20th in Australia) GoPro will reveal all. But until then, this video is the best example we have yet of what the Karma will be able to do. And what that is looks very, very impressive \u2014 incredibly smooth motion from a drone that starts out high above a library floor, but that then whizzes \u2014 silently \u2014 down into the bookshelves and through the stacks and underneath table lamps, before coming in close to focus on a student\u2019s face.  GoPro always puts together some amazing videos, but this one is getting us very excited for the unveiling of the Karma. [GoPro] I'd say this is the equivalent of a CGI trailer for a video game. My first thought is that, if that was filmed with a Karma+GoPro, it must be a tiny UAV. My second thought is that the slightest puff of wind will make flight/video difficult. Many assumptions. The unveiling will be interesting. That thing must be so small, would be great for downhill filming I would doubt it would be silent! They have added the SFX in post. It must be very small. I'm guessing they managed to produce this down to about 500 grams all up (totally possible). It deals with mixed ground effect really well, eg through the book shelf. This would be from a combination of excellent flight control algorithms and also the small size and power. Looks like a good alternative to Tinder... Something like the Tiny Whoop (Blade Inductrix with cam) but a bit bigger would be amazing...flight software is getting much, much better. Add some collision avoidance and position hold and we are getting to a truly user friendly camera platform. This is definitely not the drone. GoPro leaked their new products on the Italy store. It is a new camera, hand held Gimbal and the drone. I'm pretty certain Karma is a reference to the story of GoPro and how the creator originally sold the products out the back of his van and was ridiculed.  But yeah, this is most likely the hand held gimbal. I doubt it is a drone. Look at the book at the end of the video, no movement of the pages, or movement of hair. Anyone that has flown a drone would know how much air they push out.

VOne third of us don\u2019t get advertised broadband speeds How much broadband speed do consumers in the United Kingdom actually NEED in order to get the most out of the Internet? That\u2019s the question which was posed by broadband information website ISPreview.co.uk in a new online reader survey of  2,360 UK Internet users. It found that 33.5% believe they need 100Mbps+ (Megabits per second) and another 31% chose 50Mbps. Both of the top voted speeds are notably faster than the Government\u2019s starting definition for \u201csuperfast broadband\u201d (24Mbps) and well above the proposed 10Mbps Universal Service Obligation (the USO is expected to be introduced in 2020). How much broadband download speed do you think you NEED today (pick closest)?\u000a100Mbps+ \u2013 33.5%\u000a50Mbps \u2013 31.1%\u000a25Mbps \u2013 22.2%\u000a10Mbps \u2013 10.7%\u000a2Mbps \u2013 1.3%\u000aUnsure \u2013 0.9% Says ISPreview.co.uk\u2019s Founder, Mark Jackson: \u201cThe question of \u2018need\u2019 is a complicated one because we all have different requirements; although these days 25Mbps should be enough to do almost everything you could want.\u201d \u201cBut even this may become constrained as 4K video streaming begins to grow (a single 4K stream today requires around 20-30Mbps), especially in a busy family environment with lots of devices all sucking from the same connection. At that point a 50Mbps or faster service may be more useful.\u201d The survey also asked respondents how much broadband speed they expected to NEED in 5 years\u2019 time, which is roughly when BT\u2019s new 300-500Mbps G.fast technology and Virgin Media\u2019s similarly fast cable network should have combined to cover around 60-70% of the country (mostly urban areas). However nearly a third of respondents believe they\u2019ll need a Gigabit (1000Mbps) to do everything they want online by 2020/21. 1000Mbps \u2013 29%\u000a50-100Mbps \u2013 25.4%\u000a300-500Mbps \u2013 20%\u000a200Mbps \u2013 17.1%\u000a25Mbps \u2013 6.2%\u000aUnsure \u2013 2.1% Adds ISPreview.co.uk\u2019s Founder, Mark Jackson: \u201cGigabit connections would certainly be nice to have and very future proof, although people frequently forget that you often can\u2019t take even close to full advantage of it because most internet services deliver content at a dramatically slower pace. \u201cSimilarly computer hardware and WiFi may also struggle to keep pace with such speeds.\u201d The survey also explored the question of \u2018NEED\u2019 vs \u2018DEMAND\u2019 more closely by asking respondents whether they would still pay extra to get a 300Mbps connection today, even if they already had a stable 50Mbps service. Overall 49% said \u201cYes\u201d they would pay extra, while 40% voted \u201cNo\u201d and 11% were undecided. \u201cWhat\u2019s abundantly clear is that many consumers place a great deal of significance upon being able to take the fastest possible connection, seemingly regardless of whether or not they truly need it. As a result the ISPs and marketing departments that are able to promote such ultrafast speeds will be in a stronger position going forwards, assuming the end result is still affordable.\u201d Concludes Jackson: \u201cOn the other hand all of this talk about ever faster speeds must be incredibly galling for those poor folk still stuck in rural and digitally disadvantaged areas where slow connectivity remains the norm. We should perhaps be focused on resolving that problem first.\u201d Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VStar Trek isn\u2019t really known as a comedy, and on its face, neither is The Voyage Home. It\u2019s about the Earth being threatened by mysterious aliens, and Kirk discovering the only hope of communicating with them is via humpback whales, which are long since extinct. But somehow, combining the two results in a fish (whale?)-out-of-water comedy that\u2019s one of Star Trek\u2018s best films.\u000a Released in 1986, the Leonard Nimoy-directed The Voyage Home is primarily focused on bringing Kirk, Spock, and the rest back to the present in order to locate the aforementioned whales. But the movie\u2019s real mission to have the Enterprise crew interact, deal with, and basically be boggled by humanity circa 1986. There\u2019s no real villain to speak of, as all the conflict derives from the crew\u2019s attempts to interact with humans of the past and their \u201cextremely primitive and paranoid culture.\u201d TOTALLY inconspicuous, guys.\u000aWhile The Voyage Home mostly sticks with Kirk and Spock, it also makes sure everyone gets a moment to shine: Scotty jovially typing out the formula for transparent aluminium on an old-timey computer keyboard (\u201cHow quaint!\u201d); Chekhov, busted poking around a nuclear wessel, befuddling the FBI with his Russian accent and Starfleet credentials. Every scene in which a Star Trek character must interact with a contemporary Earth person offers the chance for some good-natured 23rd-century confusion. Even Kirk, who acts like he knows more than everyone else all the time, has some slip-ups, wondering if $US100 ($131) is a lot of money, and confusing \u201cLSD\u201d and \u201cLDS.\u201d One of the funniest sequences in the whole movie is when Kirk, Bones, and Gillian Taylor (Catherine Hicks) \u2014 a whale expert who gets caught up in their shenanigans \u2014 infiltrate a hospital to save the injured Chekhov. Naturally, this calls for disguises: And leads to some absolutely golden Bones moments, thanks to his utter disdain for the medical techniques he sees being used. (\u201cWhat is this, the Dark Ages?\u201d) But the crowning jewel of The Voyage Home is obviously this scene, in which Spock deploys the Vulcan nerve pinch on a rowdy young ruffian.  The cartoonishly sneering punk \u2014 a total cliche of 1980s movies \u2014 was played by a crew member named Kirk Thatcher, who also wrote the song that\u2019s blasting from his character\u2019s boom box. (Though he\u2019s had an extensive career behind the show-biz scenes since then, he told Wired in a recent interview that \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be remembered\u2026 I could win the Nobel Peace Prize, and my gravestone would still say, \u2018Star Trek IV: Punk on the Bus.'\u201d) It\u2019s so goddamn satisfying seeing Spock, who\u2019s even more out of step with everything than usual throughout The Voyage Home, pull his signature move at the exact right moment \u2014 and one-up Kirk in the process. It\u2019s scenes like that which make The Voyage Home one of Star Trek\u2018s most loved films (and a welcome change-of-pace after the gravity of The Wrath of Khan and\u2026 whatever The Search for Spock was). But it combines its laughs with a strong environmental message, not to mention some stirring themes about loyalty and friendship. That means there\u2019s plenty of depth to the story, too\u2026 though you\u2019re forgiven if all you remember is Spock\u2019s headband, or Kirk\u2019s horrified pantomime when the Vulcan dives into a whale tank for some interspecies mind-melding.

VVideo: Marcus Alqueres, whose superhero short Flying Man was optioned by Sony last year, takes on the horror genre with Lasiurus. It\u2019s about a guy who\u2019s so lost in his routine \u2014 and, unfortunately, has also forgotten to charge his phone \u2014 that he doesn\u2019t notice that doomsday is happening all around him.  It\u2019s like the beginning of Shaun of the Dead, except much darker and more menacing, and with creepy swarms of bats instead of zombies. Alqueres aims to expand the story into a feature-length film eventually.

V2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV offers a range of 200 miles Announced in Las Vegas this week was Chevrolet\u2019s latest electric vehicle, dubbed the Bolt. Boasting a range of 200 miles, and expected to cost roughly $38,000 ($30,000 after the federal $7,500 income-tax rebate for electric car purchases), the new electric vehicle \u2013 about the size of a small SUV \u2013 is being positioned as a mainstream electric proposition for families. \u201cThe Chevrolet Bolt represents the first serious electric vehicle available to mainstream consumers,\u201d Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book told WSJ.  \u201cIt will be an interesting test to see how the market embraces the Bolt in this era of cheap gas; But from a value and function standpoint, it sets a new benchmark in alternative-fuel options.\u201d Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show on Wednesday, GM CEO Mary Barra said the Bolt\u2019s combination of technology and affordability would help push electric vehicles into the mainstream. She said GM\u2019s scale, dealer network and manufacturing experience gives it a leg up over newer entrants to the car business, undoubtedly a veiled reference to the Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Motors. \u200bIt\u2019s not GM\u2019s first stab at an electric vehicle, of course. The Chevrolet Volt electric-car model, introduced several years ago with a much shorter range, hasn\u2019t been a big seller and it\u2019s hope that the Bolt with its longer range and much quicker recharging (up to 80 per cent in one hour) will prove much more popular with consumers. It\u2019s also surprisingly spacious. 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV \u2013 includes a wireless charging location and a sliding armrest covering a storage compartment big enough to store a tablet Due to the positioning of the battery pack, the Bolt EV interior offers seating for five passengers and 16.9 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seat. \u201cThe flat-pack orientation offered the flexibility to make the most of the proportions while creating a clean, sculpted design,\u201d says Stuart Norris, managing director of Design. \u201cThis really opened up the interior and created a fantastic view from every seating position. All of this additional space gave us a lot of opportunities to play with creative design and storage solutions.\u201d Included is a \u201cfloating\u201d instrument panel, featuring a 10.2-inch-diagonal capacitive-touch control screen. Additionally, a multipurpose, connected centre console features side-by-side cupholders, a wireless charging location and a sliding armrest covering a storage compartment large enough to store a tablet device. \u201cThe Bolt EV\u2019s design elements are designed for everyday life and the space inside accommodates it all, whether you and your friends go shopping for the day or take off for the weekend,\u201d said Norris. \u201cInside and out, this game-changing vehicle makes a dramatic statement with a distinctive identity that can only be a Chevy and challenges expectations for what an affordable EV can offer.\u201d Alan Batey, GM\u2019s North American executive vice president, said looming uncertainty over the direction of fuel prices and stringent US regulations calling for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging nearly 55 miles a gallon underpin the company\u2019s bet on the Bolt. In addition, California requires auto makers to sell zero-emissions vehicles. \u201cThere are certain states in the US where you need to sell electric vehicles if you\u2019re going to be able to sell your total portfolio. As part of that, we have a need to have a range of electric vehicles,\u201d Mr Batey told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cPeople think that the only reason people buy these is because of high fuel prices, but if you actually talk to the consumers, they buy it because they want the greatest and latest technology, and it just happens to be an electric vehicle,\u201d he added. Mr. Batey said the Bolt\u200b is crucial to overhauling Chevrolet\u2019s image in California and other large urban markets, where it has performed poorly in recent years. He said the Volt has done more to reposition the Chevy brand in California over the past five years than any other vehicle. \u201cFor Chevrolet, California is a massive opportunity because our performance there has been poor for so long,\u201d Mr. Batey admitted. \u201cBolt will play a really important role in helping build the Chevy brand in California.\u201d The Bolt also fits into GM\u2019s larger strategy to embrace new transportation technologies like ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles and includes features like one-pedal driving mode and saved settings for multiple drivers controlled through their smartphones. This week GM also unveiled a $500 million investment in Lyft Inc. with the eventual goal of developing a driverless-car hailing service. Mr. Batey said Lyft officials were impressed when GM showed them the Bolt. 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV   Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

V\u000aEditorial Depending on your point of view it\u2019s either been a great week for internet giant Google or one of the worst (certainly you wouldn\u2019t want to be in their PR department right now). While investors will no doubt be rubbing their hands with glee at parent company\u2019s Alphabet\u2019s latest financial figures, those who have just forked out thousands of pounds to HMRC for their own self-assessment tax will almost certainly be wondering how Google has gotten away with paying so little in tax so far. Just £130 million over 10 year from 2005 to 2015. A figure that amounts to around 3 per cent of its UK sales, most commentators agree. It\u2019s particularly galling as last night it was revealed that Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet has taken away Apple\u2019s title as the most valuable company in the world by reaching a market value of about $544 billion in after-hours trading. Although Alphabet closed Monday at around $518 billion, its after-hours stock spike means that it\u2019s bigger \u2014 for now. See graphic below.  Apple passed Exxon Mobil in 2011 to become the most valuable public company in the world before falling to about $538 billion at today\u2019s close, slightly less than Alphabet\u2019s valuation. Even the UK Government which initially heralded the wonderful tax breakthrough is now backtracking on the Google settlement, realising just how much money the organisation is actually making. A week after Chancellor George Osborne called the settlement a \u2018major success\u2019 Business Secretary Sajid Javid admitted it was not a \u2018glorious moment\u2019 for the UK government. Indeed the UK tax authorities\u2019 agreement with Google has fuelled a \u201csense of injustice\u201d that big businesses receive preferential treatment, he said. Whether any of this means that Google will pay any more UK tax in future remains to be seen. But sure as hell it will provide a great boost to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn whose \u2018Google-bashing\u2019 stance is sure to be more popular with voters than his call for scrapping Trident.

VAs the NBN develops every year, the technology underpinning it improves. That\u2019s the main hope we have for Australia\u2019s copper infrastructure, which is being used for fibre to the node \u2014 and, potentially, fibre to the distribution point. The NBN is trialing a variety of technologies that promise to massively improve the speed of existing copper already in the ground, including by using the already-installed HFC cable networks previously operated by Telstra and Optus. A new standard called XG.FAST will potentially be able to deliver speeds of up to 8Gbps on short copper runs \u2014 around 50 metres or less \u2014 making it suitable for the short last-metres connection of a service like FTTdp, which is currently in testing and achieving near-gigabit speeds, rivaling a full fibre to the premises install at a fraction of the overall cost.  While XG.FAST may not make it to commercial applications for some years, it points to there being some potential for the copper network that NBN paid $11.2 billion to Telstra for. It\u2019s the successor to the commercialy available G.Fast, which can be used with the last-mile copper of FTTN setups rather than the shorter setups that XG.FAST requires for the best possible speeds.  NBN is also working on a device that will be able to merge the existing HFC cable networks run around its current footprint with the short-distance copper loop that most houses currently use to connect their phone lines or ADSL internet services to in-pit copper networks. HFC\u2019s hybrid fibre-coaxial design has a higher current headroom of bandwidth than copper, and would allow an easy speed upgrade for customers within the cable footprint not currently connecting to the NBN on a HFC connection. While both of these devices aren\u2019t as elegant a solution as a full fibre to the premises rollout, they do show promise for copper. Up to 500,000 homes around Australia may be connected to the NBN via FTTdp in the future, so faster copper-based solutions are equally important as fibre development. [iTNews / SMH] Total bullshit. We're already on 100Mbit with coax on Optus. NBN will come and cut that by half and then they'll probably try and upsell the coax solution to get back to 100 Mbit. The 'forced' sale of the coax network to NBN was a criminal undertaking. That's good news for apartment dwellers, though we could already get those speeds over 50m of copper Cat6. It's a far cry from what fibre is capable of though, even today. Next up: XG.REALLYFAST, that can give 40Gbps over a 2 metre run of copper. Also known as Thunderbolt 3. As opposed to fibre which is as fast as fibre is now, and will be more than double that speed in 5 years?  FFS this Liberal Govt have really screwed the NBN rollout up and I don't think there is any way to recover it for Australia or our lost Tax dollars from this political football.... makes me sad :( Copper will forever be limited by its resistance, with other loss occurring at each infrastructure point.  Optical fiber is limited by the speed of light, and future upgrades at points of infrastructure will continually increase the gap between the copper and OF solutions. Further, when we increase the speed of light in 2208, Copper will have an even harder time keeping up. limited by the speed of light  in the medium it is traveling through. Among other things. Both fibre optic and copper cable wave propagation speeds are limited. Velocity factor is about 0.7 for typical fibre optic, and anywhere from 0.5 to 0.85 for different kinds of copper cable. Both can reach just under the speed of light under the correct conditions. Propagation speeds aren't the reason fibre is superior (bandwidth is), but it does seem to keep coming up. Yeah, close but not quite true.  Optical does have limitations.  You can push the data around 10 miles before it falls off, which while its a hell of a lot longer than copper, is still a limitation.  Thats basically where the resistance of the fibre optic, or more specifically the imperfections in the glass, become too great to continue.  Or something like that.  Around that point, the quality just falls off a cliff, like a digital TV signal that works fine, until it doesnt. Not that we should be seeing 10 mile fibre loops anywhere... Its a little thing, and clearly waaaaaay ahead of copper losing speed after several hundred meters, but its a thing.  If that sounds like a negative, it isnt.  What fibre does is basically put us back to the equivalent of 1200 baud modems in terms of stress on the infrastructure.  The game goes back to being something to be sorted at the exchange, and in the lab, not out in the street. Back when people used 1200 baud modems, the resistance issues were never an issue.  There was no obvious ceiling, we were limited by mans ability to keep up, not technology's ability to deliver.  It was only with ADSL they started to see dropoffs from distance, and realised there was a shelf life for improvements. I have family that researched that very thing back in the 90's. Miles? What year is this? Also, sub sea fibre has 100km between repeaters... I just remember 10 miles, and it stuck.  They still use that measure in some countries you know.  Call it 16 or 17 kms if you want, the point was there is a limit around that mark. Also, different technology used to send stuff along those sea lines. When you have an exchange every 5-10 kms, the technology used, from the transmitter down to the fibre itself is different. Not sure how much you  know on the topic, but theres plenty out there explaining the differences. Side note: I remember looking this up a few weeks back and got a laugh: 'Of all the countries in the world, only three backwaters still use the archaic Imperial system of weights and measures:\u000aLiberia.\u000aMyanmar (a.k.a. \u201cthe country formerly known as Burma\u201d)\u000aUnited States of America' (Ref http://www.joeydevilla.com/2008/08/13/countries-that-dont-use-the-metric-system/ ) Although in terms of miles alone, you can add the UK to that list. Yeah, I saw something similar not long ago myself.  The 10 mile reference was from a British source from memory, not that I'm going to go searching the internet for it again.  The range was the point, and its far greater than where copper starts to drop off to the point its meaningless. While it's good that the boffins are squeezing more out of copper, I Wonder what the cost difference is between using systems like XG.FAST & FTTH when you include R&D? Because spending heaps of money to prove you "were right all along" saves money. Next on how to waste money while pretending you're as fiscally responsible as your 90's counterparts, plebiscites.\u000a#liberal Not to mention criticise the other side for financial blowouts then come out declaring we may enter into a trillion dollar debt... But that' s ok because they'll find a way to shift the blame of that onto others as they always do lately! Yep, way to go Turnbullshit. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 12:54 pm								 Exactly, if they stuck with the original 40bil plan then we would have all the FTTH we could enjoy. But here we are relying on 21st century tech to improve 19th century innovation. The copper in my neighbourhood was most likely cabled in the 50s and I am guessing has never had a facelift. Hell, when it rains heavily the Telstra Pit fills with water and effects our current ADSL2 line. If you mean the standard, XG.FAST wasn't funded or developed by NBN, it was developed by Bell Labs. It's a pretty interesting technology, trials in Germany last year showed it was capable of providing 1Gbps symmetrical throughput on a 70 metre copper cable. I guess the big problem is what happens when we reach that 1gbps speed limit? With true fiberoptic, the end tech gets upgraded. In this case, it just reeks of stopgap solution yet again. As deployment in most every other country goes, you do the backbone first, then to the exchange, then to the node or curb, then to the premises. XG.FAST is designed to give excellent speeds during the third stage of deployment, FTTN/FTTC, or for people within 100 metres of the exchange in the second stage. I think you missed the point though, the backbone is the fibre, that's not the issue. The issue is on the ends, where the copper is and has been for the last few years. If you utilise *any* sort of Copper on this archaic network, once those speeds have been attained and made redundant you have to go back to the well, throw *more* money at it and fix the previous mistake of utilising far slower technology. 1gb technology is interesting but it's already been proven that Fibre exceeds that. At this point the cost has blown out far beyond what was originally projected by *BOTH* sides, it's utterly ridiculous and a disgrace. There's going to be no good solution to the NBN unfortunately and in the end, it's going to go down as one of Australia's most embarassing infrastructure fuckups due to too much meddling from everyone. I didn't miss the point, I covered it - the proper way to get what we want here is to roll out in stages. Backbone first, then to the exchange, then to the node or curb, then to the premises. Each one is a different stage done at a different time, with the network upgrading organically. A staged rollout's total spend is slightly more, but the total cost is less because it captures revenue earlier and brings the bulk of customers onto the network at the start instead of at the end. Straight to FTTP runs an insane deficit for the whole life of the project. Staging isn't a stopgap, the process is how fibre has been rolled out in pretty much every country that has or is targeting FTTP, including South Korea. I share your frustration at the way NBN Co has been rolling out its network. Both parties screwed it up in major ways. But just because you're upset with the NBN doesn't mean the technology we're talking about here deserves your scorn. It's good tech that delivers 1Gbps on 70 metre existing lines (Deutsche Telekom), 5Gbps on 30 metre existing lines (British Telecom) and 10Gbps on 30 metre lines when both pairs are used (Bell Labs). It gets you symmetrical gigabit speeds for 90% of the network at stage 3 of deployment, much sooner than the expensive and slow stage 4 rollout of last-mile fibre to the premises. Funny Germany are already replacing their copper with fibre. Turnbull will get a good price on some used gear then :-P \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 8:50 pm								 They're not using an FTTP solution though, they're rolling it out in stages. FTTC is the current stage in deployment, with copper the remaining distance. Germany is doing it organically, which is how it should have been done here. Fibre or go home. Go home?  Dont mind if I do, I have fibre :) But yeah, the arguments against fibre are so ridiculous they arent even trying any more.  Best they come back to is cost, and more and more people are realising the cost savings just arent there, either short term, mid term, or long term. If it does get implemented and it does work the way they claim it can, then in a decade's time we'll be sitting wondering how Australia became a technological backwater. The "how" will be easy to answer, Tony Abbott wanted the NBN dead and Malcolm Turnbull obliged him. in a decade's time we'll be sitting wondering how Australia remained a technological backwater\u000aftfy \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 1:55 pm								 In summary, NBN is working really hard to make copper less terrible and provide some form of justification for Abbott/Turnbull's infrastructure terrorism. For all the money they've wasted buying new copper and researching new ways of making copper something other than deeply inadequate for modern communications, they could have just installed fibre and then not had to touch it for 50 years. Instead, we'll be left with a tangled and complex network of slowly degrading copper that will cost millions to maintain. If only Abbott had said "Unbelievable, Labor has had a good idea! Now let me and my colleagues in the LNP manage it properly." but that would've meant having a PM with vision. If only. But now, my unborn children and grandchildren will be cursing their names for their shortsightedness and political bastardry. But this is the biggest infrastructure project in Australia, instead of compromising on upgraded Collins class submarines and having fibre optic to the house, we compromised the NBN and had Barracuda submarines. A bribe to South Australia, was more important than having the kind of technology, that South Korea has, Australia's biggest infrastructure project since the snowy mountains. 12 submarines instead of 19 million people connected to the world, in what parallel universe does that make sense, none of them, information is strategic power, not the difference between upgraded Collins and Barracuda. I bet they haven't tested it on our corroded lines. The speed on many ADSL connections already drops when rain seeps its way into the poor joints. That was my problem a couple years ago. Initial ADSL2 speeds were about 16MBit but over a couple years it dropped to 6MBit. After a few days of rain had no connection at all, not phone, not data.  Obviously, they'd just claim in a situation like this they'll replace the worn copper with new copper... which is crazy when they could be putting fibre in instead. Thankfully mine was one of the last streets in my suburb that got FTTP before they canned it. That's the real issue.  Incredible improvement to copper throughput is fantastic, but as always these results are in a lab environment rather than real-world...or worse yet most of Australia with degraded copper which is substantially worse than what most places average real-world would be. It's only of benefit if you don't have to replace the existing copper, otherwise you may as well just lay fibre at almost the same cost. With no comment on the NBN, there are real world proofs for XG.FAST. British Telecom and Deutsche Telekom both did real world trials last year with 1Gbps and over results on 70 metres of existing cable. I can't speak for Germany, but the UK's copper network is arguably worse than ours. How much money is being spent on these trials?  It's not free to do.  At what point is it a case of 'doing trials to try and justify the copper' in just the purely dollars and cents sense. 2 KW, fridge sized home router? Have the LNP and the NBN  heard the phrase, when you are in a hole stop digging? So they think they can break the speed of light?\u000aIts funny when they make these copper wire lab experiments... then you read the last fibre optics test?  The research on Fibre hasnt stopped, its getter faster and faster. I lived in Singapore the past two years. We had 2 Gbit fibre to the home ... that's 2 Gbit fibre up and down link @ $90 per month. No data limits. I generally got better speeds to Australian servers from Singapore then I do know living back in Australia. Copper? Stop clinging on to a dead technology. Probably because half the Australian servers are in Singapore. It's our regional hub. To be fair, Singapore is a pretty different case to Australia due to its size. It has the population of Sydney in about 8% of the land area. Short distances and high population density tend to change the equation when it comes to infrastructure. Google Fibre's rollouts are similar, because they focus on single population hubs at a time so completely replacing fibre in first stage is cost-effective for them. We could have done that here too, it just would have taken longer to get out to regional areas and neither party seemed particularly interested in organic network growth. Wrong reply. \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 7:39 am								 That's nice. Will it be as reliable as an 8GPS FTTP connection? It doesn't help that the average cable length in Australia is going to be 350 meters.  (to achieve a minimum of 25 megabits for everyone on VDSL 2 the max cable length is going to be 500 meters.  which means the average distance is approximately 2thirds of the radius (more people live beyond the halfway point in a circle). Whats the speed of GFast at 350 - 500 meters? because thats what half of Australia on FTTN is going to get.  Not 1 gigabit at 70 meters.  Unless you want to do ANOTHER node roll out costing billions to reduce the average distance to 70 meters. Im 250 metres from the node and my copperis 60+ years old, i get approx. 90/35mbps on the nbn. Nothing will ever be enough for some people

VBy building a gigantic petri dish, researchers from Harvard Medical School and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology have produced a jaw-dropping visualisation showing bacteria as it mutates to become resistant to drugs.\u000a Credit: Harvard Medical School The new study, published today in Science, is the first large-scale demonstration showing how bacteria react to ever-increasing doses of antibiotics, and how these relentless microbes exploit Darwinian selection to adapt to \u2014 and even thrive within \u2014 the very medicines meant to kill them. \u201cWhat surprised me most about it was that we could actually see evolution happening in front of us,\u201d co-author Michael Baym, a postdoc at Harvard Medicla School, told Gizmodo. \u201cHere were the abstract diagrams we\u2019d been drawing for years, come to life.\u201d Each year, around 700,000 people die around the world from untreatable bacterial infections, and antibiotic-resistant superbugs could kill upwards of 10 million people each year by the mid-21st century. Just today, the UN announced a high-level meeting to discuss possible strategies and countermeasures. Baym worked with Roy Kishony of Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School on the experiment. They call their giant petri dish the Microbial Evolution and Growth Arena, or MEGA for short. It\u2019s a rectangular platform, two feet wide and four feet long, filled with a gelatinous substance known as agar, a seaweed-derived substance that\u2019s commonly used to facilitate microbial growth. Using the MEGA-plate, the researchers were able to watch antibiotic resistance develop in Escherichia coli. They divided the MEGA-plate into several sections, each of which was saturated with varying doses of antibiotics. The ends of the platform contained no antibiotics, allowing the bacteria to thrive; these areas represented the starting line. But the adjacent inner sections contained a small amount of antibiotic \u2014 just enough to kill the E. coli. Moving inward, each subsequent section of the MEGA plate was treated with a ten-fold increase in the dose of antibiotics. At the very core of the dish, there was 1,000 times as much antibiotic compared to the areas with the lowest dose. For the next two weeks, the researchers watched \u2014 and filmed \u2014 as the bacteria died, survived, and adapted to the increasingly poisonous conditions located at the borders of their immediate perimeters. The resulting timelapse video literally shows Darwinian processes at work \u2014 a process that would normally remain invisible to the human eye. As the two-week experiment progressed, the bacteria spread until they reached a potent concentration of antibiotics beyond which they could not grow. That is, until mutants \u2014 armed with the specific set of traits required to fight off the poison \u2014 finally emerged. This often didn\u2019t take long. At each concentration level, a small segment of bacteria adapted to the hostile conditions, the result of successive accumulated genetic changes. Once settled in the new section of the MEGA-plate, these tiny populations of antibacterial-resistant mutants were able to grow. When they reached the next section of the platform, the pattern repeated itself. The descendents of this initial group of mutants were able to move to areas filled with higher concentrations of antibiotics. Eventually, multiple lineages of mutants competed for the same space, with winning strains moving on to areas with higher drug doses. The MEGA-plate after 12 days. (Image: Harvard Medical School) By the eleventh day, the bacteria had migrated all the way to the highest drug concentration in the center. These hardy mutants were capable of surviving an antibiotic known as trimethoprim at a dose 1,000 times greater than the one that killed their ancestors. And some bacteria acquired a 100,000-fold ability to fend off ciprofloxacin, another common antibiotic. \u201cWe were able to evolve over a thousand-fold wild-type resistance to trimethoprim in 11 days \u2014 that\u2019s very nearly the saturation limit of the drug,\u201d said Baym. \u201cPut simply, there was no way to dissolve enough drug to kill these bacteria.\u201d Importantly, all bacterial mutants were contained and all materials decontaminated after use. Observations showed that initial mutations led to slower growth. That suggests bacteria aren\u2019t capable of growing at optimal speeds while in the midst of developing adaptations. But once they stumble upon a fortuitous immunity, it\u2019s all systems go, with growth proceeding at normal rates. Also, the fittest mutants weren\u2019t always the fastest growers. The most successful bacteria remained behind while the weaker strains were forced to deal with the intense drug doses at the front lines. \u201cThanks to the the bacteria needing to migrate to survive, we saw a surprising dynamic by which the strongest weren\u2019t necessarily winning, rather those that were good enough and close enough to the new area would beat out nominally superior mutants just by being faster,\u201d Baym said. \u201cNevertheless, in every case we saw that this successive accumulation of mutations was able to evolve extremely high levels of antibiotic resistance in a relatively short time.\u201d Looking ahead, the researchers would like to use the the MEGA-plate to predict the future evolutionary potential of specific pathogens. Armed with this knowledge, future clinicians will be able to tell which antibiotic a pathogen is resistant to, and how it might evolve resistance if certain antibiotics are used. [Science] Its a neat experiment but I hope their containment and disposal method were top notch.  Deliberately evolving super resistant bacteria has been the starting point for how many apocalyptic stories?

V\u000aConnected toy company Sphero has announced its latest toy Darkside is now available on Firebox for £99.99. Billed as mischievous alter-ego of Ollie, which launched last Autumn, Darkside is the first toy in the Sphero family designed with a personality and brought to life through the app experience and physical toy animations. The user becomes acquainted with these new behaviours through Darkside\u2019s defiant retorts beginning with the initial \u201cnaming\u201d process and again through mischievous autonomous behavior during play. Says Rob Maigret of Sphero:\u000a\u201cThe new Darkside experience we\u2019ve designed is our first run at establishing a deeper connection between user and robot.\u201d He adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point in technology where robots should be more than plastic, metals, and energy that we control, drive or manipulate. They can learn. They should have a point of view. They should play back with us. We are giving our customers a glimpse into the future.\u201d In conjunction with the retail release of Darkside, Sphero will also unleash its first-ever Instagram exclusive video series, The Chronicles of Darkside. This six-part series, available only on Sphero\u2019s Instagram account, is a glimpse into Darkside\u2019s origins and feud with Ollie. The updated Ollie app is currently available for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch and Android devices.

VGoogle has announced a big software update for Android Wear adding a bunch of new features. In what we\u2019re sure isn\u2019t a coincidence, this news comes just days from the launch of the Apple Watch.  According to TechCrunch, Wear is getting native wifi support, so that your watch can connect directly, rather than via bluetooth with your phone. This means that if you go anywhere with your watch but not your phone, you\u2019ll still be able to pick up notifications and so on. The user interface is also getting a refresh, making it easier to find third party apps \u2013 and apps will also be able to be \u201calways on\u201d, which will no-doubt be useful for runners and the like. There will also be wrist-flicking gestures, to help you navigate menus more easily, and you\u2019ll also be able to draw emojis \u2013 which will then be translated into actual emojis for transmission to friends. It isn\u2019t clear exactly which Android Wear devices will get the update (perhaps it will be all of them) \u2013 but the round-screened Moto 360 looks like a dead cert. We\u2019ll let you know when it hits. James is the Editor of TechDigest. You can follow him on Twitter @Psythor.

VLike an endless blaze roaring forth from the gates of Hell, the solar wind is majestic, awe inspiring and terrifying. The only proof you need that the Sun is the one and true master of our solar system is this never-before-seen view of a torrent of charged particles bursting out of our star\u2019s corona.\u000a\u000aImage: Craig DeForest, SwRI/NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center It\u2019s a processed version of a series of images collected by NASA\u2019s STEREO spacecraft, a pair of space-based observatories that have had their eyes on the Sun since 2006, watching as solar flares and coronal mass ejections evolve on its surface before blasting off into space. For the first time, scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and elsewhere have used STEREO to image the edge of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere, or corona, and put together a detailed picture of how the endless stream of high-energy particles known as the solar wind forms and escapes.  In doing so, they have managed to solve an longstanding stellar mystery: Why, as the solar wind travels away from the Sun, does it quickly devolve from a structured series of rays into a gusty, turbulent mess? The answer lies in the magnetic field lines along which the solar wind travels. It turns out the Sun\u2019s magnetic control over the solar wind dissipates quickly as it exits the corona, dropping much faster than the pressure of the material inside the plasma itself. Released from their magnetic confinement, sharply defined rays start to break up and fan out, creating something more akin to a misty spray. \u201cEventually, the material starts to act more like a gas, and less like a magnetically structured plasma,\u201d Craig DeForest, lead author of a new study published in the Astrophysical Journal said in a statement. To capture the transition zone, which occurs some 32 million kilometres ahead of the edge of the corona, STEREO images were carefully processed to remove the background glare of the stars. Here\u2019s what those images looked like before and after processing: The solar wind bursting out of the Sun\u2019s corona before (left) and after (right) processing. Image: Craig DeForest, SwRI/NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center Aside from reminding us that we\u2019re ants at the mercy of a blowtorch, why are scientists so interested in studying the Sun\u2019s energetic outbursts? For one, by understanding when and why the Sun is active, we can develop better models for predicting space weather here on Earth, and hopefully prevent an apocalyptic solar storm from annihilating us all. Also, the first reason. The Sun is one gnarly beast. [The Astrophysical Journal via NASA] Yeah, except Jesus is the master of the solar system..glad we're at his mercy because unlike the sun, he loves us!

The reasons for this are due to the cold weather having an effect on the battery itself by slowing the chemical reaction within. On top of this, the growing use of heaters, lights and other electrics puts further strain on the battery on ignition. To ensure your battery performs to its optimum over the winter period, it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t leave it unused for prolonged periods \u2013 if it hasn\u2019t had a regular charge running through it will often struggle to get going. Keeping a battery charger nearby can be a big help. You should always ensure your coolant is between the minimum and maximum markers on your tank and it is doubly important that there is also anti-freeze in the coolant \u2013 this is not only cheap to do but easy, whereas any damage to a frozen engine is costly. Don\u2019t take the risk! Give your tyres the quick once over, ensuring you look for adequate tread depth and any damage such as splits or bulges. If you live in an area famed for its snowfall, it makes sense to invest in some winter tyres or, failing that, snow socks for your current tyres as these can give you more control and grip in the icy conditions. With grit and slush on the road in winter, screenwash can be a real godsend for motorists on long journeys. Despite this, it\u2019s important that the concentration of coolant is suitable for cold conditions and keep an eye out for what temperature it will protect you up to, with -10*C being a safe bet. Give your wiper blades a once over, making sure to check for any splits and damage or dirt that could smear the windscreen. It\u2019s very important that the wipers won\u2019t hinder your driving. In the dark morning and dark evenings that book-end our winter days, lights are perhaps one of the most important bits on your automobile \u2013 not only for your safety but for the safety of other road users and pedestrians. Check your car for faulty or damaged bulbs and replace them if necessary and ensure the casings are kept clean. Though you should do this regularly, along with coolant this is doubly important to check during winter and ensure the levels are regularly maintained. Dirty oil can cause many issues to your automobile during winter so it is important to keep on top of it. All of these tests can be completed by you, and everything you need can be found in our Winterisation section.

VThe Withings Activité and the far more affordable Withings Activité Pop showed the world that fitness trackers don\u2019t necessarily have to look hideous. And while the new heart rate-tracking Steel HR makes some aesthetic compromises to gain smartwatch functionality, it\u2019s still one of the most beautiful wearables you can buy.\u000a\u000aInstead of using an LCD or OLED display to provide feedback on the wearer\u2019s activities, the Activité and Activité Pop both featured a traditional analogue watch face with a smaller dial in one corner showing how close the user was to their pre-defined fitness goal \u2014 be it steps taken, calories burned or other metrics configured in the Withings app. The new Withings Steel HR still has that secondary analogue dial, but it\u2019s been moved to make room for an additional monochrome screen that can display information about incoming calls, emails, text messages and calendar reminders. It turns the Steel HR into a bona-fide smartwatch instead of just a fitness tracker, but that latter functionality has also been improved with the addition of a optical hear rate monitor that uses green lights and a small camera to detect variations in the level of blood running through the wearer\u2019s wrist. The most surprising feature of Withings latest wearable, however, is the price. The Withings Activité arrived with a hefty $US450 ($595) price tag, while the Withings Activité Pop used cheaper materials to get that down to just $US150 ($198). The new Steel HR isn\u2019t quite that cheap, but at $US180 ($238) for the 36mm version, and $US200 ($265) for the 40mm, it offers a decent amount of functionality in a form factor that most smartwatch haters might actually want to wear. Australian pricing and availability has yet to be confirmed. [Withings] I'm hoping someone stocks these locally soon.\u000aI'm very happy with my Withings Activite Pop, and came very close to buying the Activite Pop Steel (not the original $600+ one)\u000aI'm glad I didnt as these new variants have come out less than a year later.

VVideo: Finding 116 excavators to demolish an ageing 24-year-old overpass in just one night is all but impossible \u2014 unless you live in China.\u000a\u000aIn the city of Nanchang, contractors assembled an army of construction equipment to tear down the main part of this overpass in just one night, with the entire job requiring only a 56-hour disruption to local traffic. It was an impressive sight to behold.  [YouTube via The Awesomer] I was in China recently.  China has a fifth of the world's human population and a quarter of the world's manufacturing.  The sheer scale of their industry dwarfs anything you can find anywhere else.  Their level one cities make the largest Western cities look like small towns, not just due to population, but due to the amount of industry and economic activity going on. Bah! That video wasn't very satisfying. Few seconds of actual demolition, then cut to the aftermath. I go to China regularly and I see this all the time, the most memorable was about 10 years ago, me and a friend checked into a hotel, across the hotel was all about dirt land with fences, I went to sleep and next day, I walked out and there was a park outside, I was like WTF? my friends room had the view of the park and he actually spent the night drinking and watching the construction, he told me there was probably 50 workers working throughout the night, putting grass and trees in, then adding things like exercise machines in, what probably takes Aussie councils months took overnight in China My favourite part of the video was two residents stating how "it's very efficient" and then the video immediately cutting to workers shovelling gravel into hessian sacks to carry away.

VEvery shower you take costs a little bit of water and a lot of power to keep that water warm. If you\u2019ve ever wondered just how much your shower habits cost, this calculator can help you figure it out.\u000a This tool, from the same site that brought you the pizza calculator, lets you input how much you pay for units of water and energy (for heating your water). You then add in how many people live in your house, how many showers they take per day, and how long they stay under the water. It\u2019s a tool made in the US, but that doesn\u2019t matter. If you can find out how much your water and energy costs, and what your water flow is like, then the dollar value will be accurate. To no one\u2019s surprise, shorter and fewer showers means you can save money, but depending on your usage, you might be surprised how much. Even in a small household, reducing your average shower time from fifteen to five minutes can save hundreds over the course of a year. Even if the water itself is fairly cheap, don\u2019t forget how much it costs to heat it up to just the right temperature. Shower cost calculator [Omni Calculator] Link please.

VCompanies have finished reporting results for the financial year so it\u2019s time to take stock of how the different business sectors of Australia are fairing and the big picture factors that are at play. Today: Australia\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d banks: Westpac, ANZ, NAB and CBA. The biggest Australian banks are fairing well in a year of increased pressure to reform from politicians, international events like the Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and more regulation from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). A number of interrelated factors have contributed to the relatively strong performance of the Australian banks. For instance, the banks have limited exposure to the types of securities which led to massive losses for their counterparts in other countries. The banks also heavily rely on domestic loans, particularly the low risk household sector, so better lending standards and a proactive approach to prudential supervision by APRA may have contributed. The Basel III regulatory requirements, brought in after the 2008 financial crisis, emphasise holding an increased amount of subordinated debt, as a measure of market discipline. However all the big four banks are holding less and less subordinated borrowings. More specifically, it declined by more than 50% from 2007 to 2014, according to our calculations. APRA limits banks\u2019 holdings of higher risk securitised assets, these are loans packaged into securities, to a maximum of 25% of the banks\u2019 loan portfolio. These are high risk if not properly understood or defined, as happened with United States home loans, blamed for the start of the global financial crisis. When Australian banks calculate bank capital requirements, they need to fully account for securitised assets. This is a rule from APRA that goes beyond international standards, to reflect the risk inherent in these products. Inter-bank liquidity tightened significantly with all banks increasing their holdings of Exchange Settlements Accounts at the Reserve Bank, this a form of low risk liquidity. Australian banks have lower interbank deposits compared to their Europe and USA counterparts and are also heavily involved in long term wholesale funding and are required to hold more liquid assets including government debt to deal with liquidity. All of this makes Australian banks less risky in times of crisis because spillover effects from other banks are less likely. The big four [CC BY] There has been a significant increase in concentration in the Australian banking industry since the global financial crisis. For example with Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia taking over St. George Bank and Bank West, respectively. Following mergers, the big four account for 88% of the Australian banking system assets. This reinforces the idea that the banks are \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d. The banks have also moved to more fee generating activities, which increases risk, but to a lesser extent in Australian banks. Data shows between 1998 and 2014, on average, 1.2% greater interest income was generated relative to non-interest income for Australian banks, according to our analysis. However, there is also similar evidence for the top eight publicly-listed Canadian banks. They exhibit on an average, a 2.5% increase in net interest revenue relative to non-interest income over the same time period. This reinforces that Australian and Canadian banks demonstrated  extra ordinary resilience during the credit turmoil in the global financial crisis. The World Economic Forum in 2008 reported that Australia and Canada were among the top four safest banking systems in the world. Large banks in Australia are active in international markets through direct ownership of foreign based banks and having offshore operations as a source of capital. Deregulation of banking in countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia and many developing countries has opened up new markets for foreign banks. Australian banks\u2019 largest international exposure is to New Zealand, where all big four banks retain sizeable operations. Although the growing interdependence among international economies and financial markets is certain to continue, the impact of Brexit on Australian banks remains minimal. It remains to be seen in the long-run how Australian banks will weather the international banking/economic developments. As a last measure of the bank health, we can measure the domestic systemic risk with a methodology based on one used by the official Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Based on July 2016 monthly data, the big four banks account for 80.38% of the systemic risk in the financial system and the riskiest, from highest to lowest, are the National Australia Bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac and ANZ.  \u000aMamiza Haq, Lecturer in Finance, The University of Queensland and Necmi K Avkiran, Associate Professor in Banking and Finance, The University of Queensland\u000aThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

VDoro\u2019s new 4G phone, the 8030, is intended for an older market While most of the hype is around high end smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S7, specialist manufacturer Doro is pleased to reveal details of its new 4G smartphone for the over 65 market. The Doro 8030 comes with a user interface which cleverly uses verbs to drive the user\u2019s required actions, rather than icons, So rather than relying on the user to search for a specific application icon it uses actions such as \u2018Call\u2019, \u2018View\u2019 or \u2018Send\u2019 and then prompting with \u2018Who\u2019 or \u2018What\u2019. Also on board is loud sound, Hearing Aid Compatibility and soft touch coating for a better grip. Doro\u2019s cloud enabled app My Doro Manager is pre-installed, allowing trusted family members and friends to offer the user help and support remotely, without being physically present. Research from Doro shows that demand for smartphones in people aged 65+ continues to rise steadily at around 11% year-on-year. Smartphone ownership among seniors is now nearing 40% and this figure will continue to rise through 2016, as 60% of those aged 65+ intend to purchase a smartphone at their next upgrade. The Doro 8030 is the second LTE (4G) device to join the Doro handset family and will launch exclusively with O2 in the UK. The phone will be available through O2 stores nationwide and also online. The Doro 8030 comes in a black finish with a steel trim and will be priced at £99 on Pay As You Go. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be Doro\u2019s launch partner for the 8030 and think it\u2019s a perfect phone for first time smartphone users,\u201d says Ben Bevins, Head of Portfolio and Launch at O2 in the UK. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen fantastic results from Doro\u2019s previous phones and, thanks to their unparalleled insight into their target market, think the 8030 will continue to build Doro\u2019s audience in the UK.\u201d Chris Millington, Managing Director at Doro UK and Ireland adds: \u201cThis new device is a breakthrough \u2013 it is a combination of our award-winning design principles and innovative interface. I firmly believe the Doro 8030 will be a true revolution in the smartphone space as this is our most \u2018human\u2019 and forward-thinking device to date.\u201d Doro has also unveiled a range of 3G clamshell phones \u2013 the Doro 6520, 6525 and 6530. All offer connectivity with social media such as Facebook and Twitter, along with an email client and a web browser. The highest spec phone of the trio is the Doro 6530. This device has GPS technology to facilitate Doro Connect & Care. This technology takes the company\u2019s successful My Doro Manager remote assistance concept a step further, allowing a network of friends and family to be contacted when the user needs help or support with tasks such as going food shopping, a problem in the home or taking to a doctor\u2019s appointment. The three devices all offer many user benefits to help people get more from their phone. In addition to a 2.8 inch colour display there\u2019s Hearing Aid Compatibility, amplified sound and HD Voice. The two top models, Doro 6525 and Doro 6530, both feature an external display clearly showing to the user who\u2019s calling and enabling the user to decide whether to take the call or not without even opening the phone. Doro has also added talking numeric keys to its feature phones enabling the user to hear which number has been pressed \u2013 a helpful and reassuring function for the user. Other features include Bluetooth connectivity, one touch torch, FM radio, well-spaced keys and direct dial buttons for key functions. Pricing and availability to be announced soon.

VAll the major telcos have released their pricing plans for the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. We\u2019ve consolidated all the pricing information from Telstra, Optus and Vodafone right here. Read on to find out more.  All plans are on a 24-month contract, with monthly handset repayments (when applicable) depending on the plan and model. So far, Virgin is offering the cheapest iPhone 7 deal that will set you back $62 dollars a month for the 32GB version. However, you only get $300 worth of calls and text and just 300MB of data. Telstra doesn\u2019t break its handset pricing out so it\u2019s all inclusive in the total pricing. By far, Telstra has the most expensive iPhone 7 plans when you factor in the amount of data you get.       Optus has some reasonable iPhone plans as well and all their deals include unlimited standard talk and text.       Vodafone was the first to reveal its pricing for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Plans are reasonably priced and there is a lot of choice here, depending on how much data you want. Every plan includes unlimited national calls and national text messages.       Virgin has a great variety of plans and, as mentioned before, it has the cheapest deal for an iPhone 7 32GB on contract, although you are only limited to $300 calls and 300MB of data. The rest of the plans include unlimited talk and text.       My first "First!"! I think I've found a way to save $443 buying an iPhone 7 256GB in Australia. It involves signing up for a Virgin contract. Context for calculations: My current plan is an old Optus deal with 3GB data, unlimited calls, $40/month. I deduct this from the cost of the contract to determine the true cost to me for the handset because I am happy with the network and plan. Using Life Hacker's Plan Hacker I found the Virgin $50 Plan. With handset costs the Virgin $50 plan is $79/month or $1896 over 24 months. Getting a similar plan (with online 1GB bonus), on the same network I deduct my current sim only plan cost ($40*24=$960) from the $1896 total makes my cost of the handset $936 down from $1379 if bought outright. Well it makes me feel a lot better about wasting so much money on a phone made by billion dollar company profiting from chinese factory labour and not paying tax. Any comments or other sweet spots found by anyone else?

VAfter months of speculation, rumours, and some excellent reporting, Sony\u2019s latest Playstations are finally here. Sony announced the new consoles at a press event in the Playstation Theatre in New York City today. Hosting a major tech event the same day as Apple day seems like a risky move, but Sony\u2019s event was packed with journalists eager for a break from the House of Cook and a visit to the House of Nathan Drake.  The Playstation Neo, aka Playstation 4.5, is officially on its way. Renamed the Playstation 4 Pro, this guy has a lot of PC-level guts in it. The hard drive is a whopping 1TB, and both the CPU and GPU have been upgraded. This souped up console is the first from Sony to allow you to play games in 4K. That\u2019s a critical necessity as TVs with lower resolutions become increasingly scarce, and PCs capable of 4K gaming become cheaper and more common. It also provides the games in HDR, which means significantly more detail in areas of extreme brightness and darkness. Things washed out by a pop of light or a deep shadow are not more visible. That said, Sony promises that original PS4 will also be HDR-capable via a patch by the end of the month. This is the game Infamous: Second Light as it would be seen on an original PS4. This is the same game, same shot, on the PS4 Pro. Ironically a single image from a still camera is incapable of adequately showing just how improved the details are. Besides HDR capabilities, upscaling old games to 4K, and playing newer games natively at 4K, the PS4 Pro can also play all your other content in 4K and HDR, including Netflix and Youtube. But the best part is that the PS4 Pro is the forward compatibility of current titles. The Xbox One S, Microsoft\u2019s competing console, doesn\u2019t yet have games that are compatible with its ability to display in 4K and HDR. But multiple PS4 games will be available at launch and take advantage of the PS4 Pro with a simple patch, and Sony promises that any developer can make their game work with the Pro with a minor tweak. Which means there should be no significant gap between titles available for both the Pro and original PS4. It also provides better looking games on 1080p and lower resolution screens. In the sample Sony presented, there was clearly more detail on screen, with a character moving through weeds on the PS4 Pro that weren\u2019t present on the original PS4. The PS4 Pro will be available November 10 for AU$559.95 (US$399). If all the TVs in your house are only capable of 1080p and lower resolutions, you don\u2019t necessarily need to worry about the PS4 Pro. It\u2019s amazing, but maybe you\u2019re on a budget. You can invest in the newly announced, slimmer Playstation 4, which begins shipping September 15. Inside, the console is virtually identical to the current PS4, with the same ports, capabilities, and 500GB hard drive. It\u2019s just much much smaller than the PS4, which made all our eyes grow big as saucers when it lumbered onto the scene in 2013. The PS4, previously known as the PS4 Slim. The Slim is smaller all around. It\u2019s half an inch narrower, three-quarters of an inch shorter, and half an inch taller. Yet the biggest and best improvement has nothing to do with size. Sony\u2019s also moved the power and eject buttons and made both actual buttons. The original PS4 had nearly invisible touch zones for powering it on and ejecting media, and those zones were right next to each other, which made for a lot of accidental ejects and power downs. The PS4 Slim, officially just called the PS4, is available September 15 and will retail for $US299 ($390). If you haven\u2019t already purchased a Playstation and you don\u2019t plan on upgrading your TV to 4K soon, then the Slim is a great (and svelte) deal. And you\u2019ll want either it or the PS4 Pro to use PS VR, which launches in October. Sony\u2019s answer to the virtual reality systems from HTC and Oculus could easily be the best of the bunch. While some of the technology found in the Vive and Rift may be more astonishing, PS VR has a much better lineup of games ready at launch. Sony has learned a lot about launching video game consoles since the original Playstation 21 years ago. The most important thing at launch, after the cool tech, are the cool games. The PS4 Pro The new, slimmer, PS4 21... years... ago SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!!!!! *curls into a ball and starts rocking* I aint old I aint old I aint old... You OK, gramps? :-P GIT OFF MAH LAWN! HAHAHA!  Thanks for the laugh, it was a rough night or work and this is the start I needed, :D The hard drive is a whopping 1TB Come on, unless it is an SSD that is far from 'whopping'. I just hope they've ditched the shitty old SATA2 connection and that dropping an SSD in will make a real difference. Question: with the PS4 Pro having more grunt, would it be preferable for running VR over the Existing PS4 or PS4 Slim? I really want to jump on the VR bandwagon, and am hoping PS4 gives me step I need. However, I currently own the original PS4. If I am just going to end up with a subpar experience by plugging in a PSVR headset then I am still spending the same amount of money to upgrade console and get headset as I would upgrading my GPU and getting a Vive. DECISIONS!! I would guess it depends on how much of the rendering load is on the seperate VR processing box and wether that box is a limiting factor. And of course whether devs code for the extra power. The actual PS4 Pro itself will push out more frames/higher res but if the VR box is designed to take a certain input (ie a target frame rate/resolution from the ps4) that may not matter. Hopefully it would at least provide a more consistent frame rate if that scenario is the case but that would depend on how well optimised the game is, ie a well optimism game that sticks to the targets on original ps4 wouldn't benefit. Hopefully Sony will clarify soon. But I would expect they won't, in case it scares off people from buying the VR add-on for their original PS4 slimmer Playstation 4, ............ Inside, the console is virtually identical to the current PS4, with the same ports,  Nope, no optical port, which is important for many, so the current or Pro version will be required for those people. Obvious point but no one has said it so I'm going too... 2x faster GPU trying to push 4 times the resolution will not end well. I was thinking the same thing, but perhaps it doesn't just come to to TFLOPS. Dat PS4 Pro power consumption: 310W vs 165W. So will it run games at 4K @ 60FPS? NO! So not 4K gaming then. I went from mid-high end gaming PC's (easily capable of 60fps with most games I played) to PS4 for casual gaming and honestly couldn't care less about the drop in frame rate. It just doesn't seem that important sitting on the couch with a controller. But will it run games at 4K? YES! So it is 4K gaming then. Neo isn't Native 4k. It can do it, and upscales to it, but isn't targetting it. Sony have said as much in the past. Consider that a condition of Neo mode is that it can't run at a slower fps than normal ps4. If targeting 4k Native then, that means 4x the pixels, at least the same frame rate on a console only about 2.2x the power. Doesn't take a maths genius to work out that few AAA games will be anywhere near Native 4k. It'll just do dynamic resolutions to as close as it can get and upscale from there. "Besides HDR capabilities, upscaling old games to 4K, and playing newer games natively at 4K, the PS4 Pro can also play all your other content in 4K and HDR, including Netflix and Youtube." If you're correct that would be a pretty misleading paragraph then! Also a massive fail.. no UHD Blu-Ray player in either model, even though the Xbox 1 S has it... Personally I would rather pay less for the Playstation and have 4K streaming only available.   I guess they don't see many people buying 4K discs.  I certainly fit into that box. It's not cheaper though. It's more expensive than xbone s. Justly so but it's not cheaper.\u000aIt's odd they don't support bit since Blu-ray is their baby. You'd think they'd want to promote it in an affordable system. It's strange. It wouldn't stop me getting it but does mean I'll probably get an xbone s now that I wouldn't habe otherwise bought. Can't argue with that.  I guess it's still better value for money than a Fetch Mighty though.   I don't have any current/next gen boxes.  Probably going Xbox this time, have always had Playstations previously. Maybe they didnt want to cannibalise their own 4K bluray player sales and hoping fans wont jump ship to Xbox. does anyone know the dimensions of the pro? I'm tempted to trade my current PS4 in for one, but that's still $300 at EB. Plus i've got the Gears of War Xbone coming next month, I don't really need to buy another console >_> But it would be cool to own..

VIt\u2019s a good idea to make sure your affairs are in order before beaming down to a mysterious new planet wearing a red Starfleet uniform, but what if you were wearing a pre-damaged uniform first? Maybe whatever aggressive alien race you were about to face would assume you\u2019d already been phasered to death, and leave you alone.\u000a Illustration by Jim Cooke It\u2019s worth a shot, especially since this pre-blasted Star Trek Redshirt tee can be had for just shy of $US34 ($44).

VIt\u2019s been a long, long time since we checked back with Bluetooth speakers, and the market is still flooded with an endless number of near-anonymous companies churning out absolutely awful products. To that end, little has changed.\u000aImages: Bryan Menegus & Mario Aguilar/ Gizmodo Thankfully, some of our past favourites have since created sequels to their more successful speakers \u2014 and previous contenders have seriously stepped up their game. These days bluetooth speakers come with quite a few bells and whistles: voice assistants, single-serving apps, multi-pairing. Cool. For some folks that might be what sways their purchasing decision. But lest we forget, we\u2019re talking about speakers, and a speaker\u2019s primary function is to make music sound good. If it doesn\u2019t accomplish even that, why the hell would you buy it? To gauge how well these speakers reproduced music I picked songs I knew like the back of my hand from a variety of genres to test specific frequency ranges. Lows were assessed with instrumental hip-hop, dubstep, and other genres that are taxing on subwoofers; chuggy, technical metal put the low mids through their paces; punk for the mids; acoustic singer-songwriters stuff for the highs and high mids; modern pop to check how all the ranges interacted. Cheap speakers have a tendency to under- or over-represent certain portions of the frequency spectrum and distort at higher volumes making familiar tracks sound off. Good ones should sound flat and accurate across a variety of frequencies. That said, expectations for the purposes of this review also include ability to deal with environmental hazards and human error, loudness, and price point. All of these speakers are $US200 ($264) or less. UE won us over last time, and it\u2019s taken the top spot once again. The 15-hour battery life is above average and the construction is rugged enough to take a few falls. An IPX7 waterproof rating is more than enough for most potentially damaging situations (in a shower, at the beach, a spilled beer.) There\u2019s enough oomph for the $US160 ($211) Boom 2 to be heard over a crowded party, and unlike some other speakers, the sound it produces is reasonably accurate \u2014 no chintzy-sounding boosts in the higher frequencies. Pairing with the Boom 2 on mobile will prompt you to download an app. It\u2019s not mandatory, but it will give some EQ options and a readout of current battery levels. Most speakers of this size are light on bass and the Boom 2 is no exception, but UE ticks so many of the right boxes that it\u2019s hard to recommend anything better. However\u2026 The Mini 2 is heavy. It\u2019s expensive. It\u2019s shaped like an alarm clock from the 80s. But goddamn it sounds incredible, especially for a speaker this small. The Mini 2 is the only of these speakers where songs sounded better than through headphones. I tried every genre of music on this thing to try to find its sonic deficiency and came up totally shorthanded. For $US200 ($264) you get great sound, but it suffers in the portability department. \u201cThis product must be used indoors,\u201d the instructions read. It\u2019s not splashproof, shockproof, or dustproof. If portability means carrying a speaker from a bedroom to a living room, sure, this Mini 2 is portable. But it\u2019s just not built for the kind of impromptu applications most of these speakers strive to fulfil. The $US150 ($198) Explorer takes the cake for cyclists, and not just because a bike mount is included. (Others did too, but they felt seriously chintzy.) The grenade-looking case can take falls and water damage no problem. Leave it strapped to your bike in a rainstorm? Should be fine. It has better than average response in the bass and low-mids \u2014 which is about all you\u2019ll be able to hear anyway with the wind rushing past your face. Let\u2019s get it out of the way first: the Balance doesn\u2019t charge off USB, which is annoying as hell. Looking past that, Braven\u2019s oblong offering has shockingly accurate sound, a rugged build, 18 hours of play time, and the ability to charge other devices. There are other speakers that offer similar features, but not all of them for a meager $US84 ($111). JBL Flip 3 Frankly the Flip 3 is totally adequate! It\u2019s barely more balanced than the Fugoo, but quieter too. At $US80 ($105) it\u2019s a steal, but I truly do not understand the form factor: Speakers at either end make it unappealing to prop up vertically; on it\u2019s side it rests right on top of the buttons that control volume and other functions. At half the price of the Boom it wants to be a bargain, but sadly I can\u2019t recommend any sub-$US100 ($132) speakers as being particularly good. UE Roll 2 UE\u2019s little UFO is adorable (it even comes with a pool floatie!) and it sounds great \u2014 though not quite as good as the Braven Balance. Still, if you prefer a smaller and more whimsical form factor with fewer features, the Roll 2 is a steal at $US80 ($105). LG P5 Music Flow It\u2019s a beautiful looking speaker, but that\u2019s about all it is. The Music Flow is quiet, lacks mids, and insists on installing horrible bloatware app to your phone. However, for its size a 15-hour battery life is impressive. Marshall Stockwell The build quality on this speaker is just spectacular, and perfectly emulates the design the amps it\u2019s based on \u2014 complete with a 3.5mm input where the 1/4\u2033 would be and pop-out EQ and volume knobs. Unfortunately Bose\u2019s smaller, bi-directional Soundlink Mini 2 just barely beats it out in sound quality, and for the same price of $US200 ($264). UE Boom Our previous top choice for best overall speaker. It was good. It\u2019s successor, the UE Boom 2, is better. JBL Flip 2 Our former best pick for under $US100 ($132) was nice, but the Braven Balance was better. Beats Pill When the Beats Pill arrived a few years ago it was a better than average option, but even back then I felt the speaker didn\u2019t sound amazing. It\u2019s far outstripped by some competitors today, and at $US200 ($264) it costs more than double what it\u2019s worth. Braven 705 Sounds terrific, and it\u2019s handsome and rugged too. Can top off my phone via USB. My quibble is that the ports are underneath a removable plastic door that protects them from the elements. Knowing my disorganization, I\u2019m probably going to lose it. Braven BRV-X Waterproof and rugged! Doubles as an external battery to charge phones! But so ugly. The screw cap design which keeps the guts dry would be a sad thing to lose, too. Braven BRV-1 A smaller version of the beast above. Slightly more desirable for a camping trip because of its small size. But ultimately the design still feels too unrefined to wholeheartedly recommend. Bose SoundLink Mini A good-looking little metal-encased speaker, but too expensive at $US200 ($264). It has the good old fashioned flat sound Bose is known for, but lacks impressive bass. It\u2019s also heavy and only charges using a proprietary cable. Bose SoundLink Colour This speaker\u2019s design is unusual and sort of fun, especially if you get it in one of a plethora of available colours. The sound, however, isn\u2019t good enough for such a chunky beast. Harman Kardon Esquire Mini This thing looks like an old-school hard-shell clutch purse. The design didn\u2019t do much for me. Beyond the aesthetics, the kickstand on the back is a pain. Sol Republic Punk If you\u2019re not carrying a bag, portable means it fits in your pocket. The $US70 ($92) Sol Republic Punk actually sounds very good for something that has the footprint of a coaster. Its not going to sound as something with multiple drivers and a larger enclosure, but it delivers very convincing bass for such a tiny package. Additionally, the design is water-resistant, and rugged enough so you won\u2019t destroy it when you accidentally sit on it. Jabra Solemate Kitchy design and generally disappointing audio performance weren\u2019t the worst part. The worst part is the annoying lounge beat that plays when the speaker is in pairing mode. Jawbone Mini Jambox The more affordable, portable version of the speaker that started it all. The slim design is nice and practical and there are plenty of colours to choose from to make sure it fits your tastes, but the sound lacks clarity. JBL Pulse The JBL Pulse has fun lights that illuminate with the music on the exterior. (You can turn them off if you\u2019re trying to sleep.) I quite like the lights. Unfortunately, the sound is a distorted mess. I expected much better from such a large speaker. Sol Republic Deck The Sol Republic Deck lies on its back and projects great sound in 360 degrees. It\u2019s got rugged design. I actually quite like this speaker, and admittedly, it\u2019s getting blown out online for less than $US100 ($132). It may not be long for this world. Sol Republic Deck Ultra A louder, slightly larger version of the Deck, it has an impressive 22 hours of battery life but only charges using a proprietary cable. $US150 ($198) is a little much for this powerful beast methinks. Sony SRS-X3/SRS-X5 I\u2019m generally fond of Sony audio products, but these bricks miss the mark. I tested the smaller X3, and at two pounds it was far heavier than speakers that sound far better. The X5 is even bigger. UE Boom Mini Decent sounding little speaker from the same folks who make my favourite one. But I don\u2019t like the uni-directional sound design, which has a narrow field compared to most others. Is there a difference in sound quality between the original bose mini and the new one? Eton Rugged Rukus, great sound, water resistance, solar power, haven't had to charge it once since I got it 3 years ago, just leave it out in the sun or near a window, but its battery can top up my phone while it plays UE Megaboom? Doesn't even get a look in? Was under impression this exceeded the Boom and Boom 2.... Ermmm the UE Boom and Boom 2 fit in bicycle water bottle cages. I woulda thought that made it best for cycling given it's also waterproof and top of the list. Generally no extra mount needed, just whack it in a spare biddon cage. The UE Roll has a big elastic on the back so you can mount it to your handlebars, which is even better because you get the sound pointed at you and you can reach the controls. Of the speakers I have looked at or own(ed) myself, I cannot agree with a single assessment here. And let me be clear, over the past few years I have owned, in order, a UE Boom, Infinity One, Harman Onyx Studio, UE Roll, JBL Xtreme, Braven Balance, JBL Flip 3 and a Sony SRS XB3. My current line-up is the Onyx Studio for home and the Sony XB3 for cycling, BBQ, etc. I have also tried and rejected most of the speakers tested here. UE's Boom sounds OK and works better across a broader range of volume and music than the Bose SoundLink Mini. The Bose only sounds good at low to medium volume but the more you turn it up, the more it attenuates the mids and treble to keep the bass pumping. At high volume it sounds like someone threw a heavy doona over it. I loved my UE Roll but replaced it with the JBL Flip 3 when it came out because it sounded better in every situation.  For my money, though, the Sony XB3 cannot be beaten. It sounds better than anything else in the $200-$300 price range, the battery lasts forever, it feels more waterproof than most fully waterproof speakers and it is very rugged. It has replaced both the Flip 3 and Infinity One as my single go-anywhere choice. One of the best things about it is how well it works with My Walkman. With every other speaker, I have to go through a complex series of menus on the Walkman to connect it but with the XB3, I just tap the Walkman to the NFC spot on the top and it switches on and pairs in a few seconds. It's awesome. The only downside is you can't charge it via USB so you have to cart the charger if you go away on holidays or anything. For audio quality that is reviewed as being audiophile level good there is an unsung* (pun intended)  hero that hasn't got a mention. The Foxl by Soundmatters. Great battery life, and comes with a subwoofer attachment for when you're somewhere with power. When you don't have the sub handy, the unit uses the battery as a sub. The thing came with a anti-vibration mat it thumps out so much sound. But it was a bit more than the $200 limit spec'd in this article. A mate of mine has a Foxl and whilst it is amazing for its size, in absolute terms it really can't compete with larger speakers like these. It's also a couple of years old now and this technology has moved on a lot since then.

p738
VLots and lots of Australians drive to work. We\u2019re a country of commuters. But, by and large, we commute in older cars that aren\u2019t really made for traffic. The average age of Australian cars is just over 10 years, a long time before stop-start engines and self-driving luxuries. But, if you buy a new car, maybe even a hybrid \u2014 which are cheaper than they\u2019ve ever been \u2014 then your commuting experience will change. Dramatically.  Most of the time, I drive my Polo GTI to work \u2014 well, actually every day. I\u2019m too lazy and too antisocial to walk to the train station and sit on a train with people taking up space and making noise and being annoying. I\u2019ll be honest, though, mine is not a great commuter\u2019s car. In the past few years that I\u2019ve owned it, a few visits to the track and a bunch of mods \u2014 bit of suspension work, a few different power tweaks, a heavier clutch and a lighter flywheel \u2014 has made it increasingly uncomfortable to drive through the city, in bumper-to-bumper traffic. It\u2019s okay. But not great. So for the last month and a half, I\u2019ve been in a brand new Toyota Corolla Hybrid, a $31,920 four-door petrol-electric hybrid that is the epitome of fuel-efficient, commuter-friendly motoring. And coming from a car that nonetheless isn\u2019t terrible as a daily driver, I\u2019ve nonetheless had my eyes opened to the absolute difference there is between driving an average-aged, manual car and a new, efficient hybrid for the daily rigor of commuting from the suburbs to the city. For one, the difference in fuel economy is stark. My Polo, mildly modified and middle-aged as it is, gets around 12 litres per 100km. Driving the Corolla Hybrid lightly and with a bit of mechanical sympathy, but without doing any silly hypermiling or driving like a grandma, I\u2019ve seen fuel economy figures as low as 3.7 litres per 100km over the course of a morning commute. My average fuel economy over the Corolla\u2019s first tank of petrol was a third \u2014 4 litres per 100km \u2014 of what I\u2019d been paying before. That\u2019s the kind of fuel saving that quickly adds up. Toyota\u2019s little Corolla Hybrid doesn\u2019t have any gears \u2014 not gears in the traditional sense \u2014 but rather a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that dynamically adjusts its gearing to provide a compromise between acceleration and engine RPMs, balancing fuel usage against the haste with which you get around your drive and weave through competing traffic. Three driving modes \u2014 EV only, a standard Eco mode, and PWR, which you can guess the meaning of \u2014 let you adjust the aggressiveness with which the CVT shifts and with which the petrol engine kicks in to provide some extra acceleration. The Corolla Hybrid isn\u2019t quick, but that CVT means it\u2019s not sluggish. And the electric motor gives it a surprising amount of go off the line, more than enough that I\u2019m able to zip away from the traffic lights and slot into Corolla-sized holes in other lanes. As a driving experience, despite the massive difference between my two current cars, I know in a heartbeat which I\u2019d prefer for my commuting, the vast amount of driving that I do every week? For the weekend? For the longer trips down the highway to see my mate that lives fifty kays away? I\u2019ll be writing about that soon. I filled up the Corolla Hybrid for the first time a couple of weeks ago, after getting a hair over four litres per 100km out of its 45 litre tank. Without running it anywhere near dry, filling up just after the petrol reminder light came on, I\u2019d travelled over 800km. That distance would have taken me a couple of trips to the petrol station, for expensive 98 octane, in my own car. If nothing else, I\u2019m noticing the difference to my hip pocket. [Toyota] I drive a 2015 Toyota Prius, thats only seems to be getting 4.4L per 100km, fill up once a fortnight 35L, 40 bucks and does around 780-800kms Firstly, 12L/100km seems very very high for a Polo (even modified). Even in stop start traffic i would expect better figures in a Commodore or Falcon.  Hybrids in theory are a pretty good option, but pretty expensive to buy outright. If you plan on keeping for a long period it may make economical sense, although a second hand model makes more sense.  As you are in Victoria i still reckon LPG is a damn good option. 4L of petrol is around $5 (depending on which day you purchase). I have a 300kw V8 running on Injection LPG, and around town i average 13.5L/100km. Given LPG is 55cpl, its about $7.50/100km. Now considering this is in a 1800kg car which is driven enthusiastically, its pretty cheap to run.  If/When petrol returns to $1.50/litre, the running costs would be pretty similar between vehicles. Of course this is only really applicable in metro melbourne, as other states pay considerably more for LPG and its limited in regional areas.  Still, for $31,920 you could buy a 2 year old VF Calais V8 with around 40,000km and convert to Vapour Injection LPG. Over a longer period the Calais should hold value and is better equipped.  I know some people want new etc etc, i just think its worth having a look at the alternatives.  Cheers So your 1.4l polo gti gets 12l/100km are the mods a hole in the fuel tank? my nearly 2 tonne diesel ute with big mud tyres gets 9l/100 and my old skylines with rb20's used to get about 10 unless I was really hammering them It's the older 20V 1.8T, which has been around for an eternity. It's a great little boat anchor but it drinks fuel and oil like nothing else. Converts into fun pretty effectively though :) That sounds about right. My 1.6 turbo Astra gets 10.8 around town and I almost never drive in peak hour traffic. I can't imagine what my V8 Commodore is going to get when I buy it next year but I am expecting 16-17, up to 20 when I am in a bad mood. Your fuel and oil consumption still seems high Campbell. My modded 9n3 GTi isn't drinking anything like that, 8-9l/100km when I'm flogging it.. I'd still rather have a lobotomy than drive a corolla hybrid. You'll only see those saving in a hybrid if you're always in stop/start traffic. Once over 40kph the hybrid system becomes dead weight. After owning a Prius (I get a bout 5lt/100) and S15 200sx (SOLD - 12lt/100), I still believe hybrid is the way to go for commuting to work.  Thus why now I've purchased a 2015 Pathfinder Ti Hybrid this year, I get around 11lt/100, however during the highway driving, I've seen 7.6lt/100 and this is hauling 2,1 tonne SUV, which is not too bad. Comparing this to Klugar, which drinks around 15lt/100 (same size SUV) However the hybrid system in Pathfinder not as good as the one in the Prius. I think the hybrid engine and the battery are too small in this size SUV. The hybrid is basically only assisting on the start/acceleration. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 7:59 pm								 I was wondering how a hybrid would go on country trips as it would be running on petrol at 100kph. I ride a single cylinder dual sport motorcycle for my commute. It gets 5.5l per 100km. So beating that with a car is brilliant. Shame you can't lane split in a car though. None of these comment re fuel consumption take in the real cost to the environment, using fuel you are just making someone else pay for the real cost some time in the future! A hybrid running a CVT transmission. Er, no thanks, even if it was paying me to drive. Maybe when I'm 90 years old and driving doesn't interest me any more. Rolling down to work everyday in the CT using no petrol is fun. Golf cart fun:) I cant stand CVT I tried one with a Pulsar rental car... it felt like a pile of crap. I have gotten the normal Corolla a few times its great, but with a CVT... I dont think so I would much prefer a DSG, though I don't care that its less fuel efficient than a CVT, it feels better.

VI\u2019ll admit it. I\u2019m a little annoyed with the new iPhone 7. No, no, it\u2019s not the headphone jack (there are plenty of ways to deal with that), I\u2019m annoyed because if I want Apple\u2019s sick dual-lens camera, I\u2019m going to have to buy the bigger iPhone.\u000a Image: AP I feel a little bit like I\u2019m stuck in a tech version of Sophie\u2019s Choice, but instead of having to choose between which of my two beloved children can live, I have to decide whether I prioritise the iPhone I can only use with one hand over the iPhone with the best camera. Let me preface this by saying that I understand that this is a really dumb thing, in the grand scheme of things, to be upset over. After all, I\u2019m ultimately the one making the decision to drop huge money (256GB model with AppleCare+ and tax) on a luxury smartphone. I acknowledge my stupidity, universe. I\u2019m still upset. Back in 2014, when Apple first released the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the company did a pretty good job making users feel like there wasn\u2019t any consequence buying the bigger phone or the smaller phone. This year, that\u2019s not the case. If you want to get that new dual-lens camera system, you have to buy the bigger phone. And based on my hands-on time, I know the camera has the potential to be incredible. There is a very good technical explanation for the camera disparity \u2014 You just can\u2019t fit the dual system in the smaller chassis of the iPhone 7 \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Apple has basically told people who prefer smaller phones that they aren\u2019t going to be able to get the latest and greatest unless they step-up and spend more money on a larger device. It\u2019s also the first time Apple has really started to add \u201ctiers\u201d to its flagship phones. With the introduction of the iPhone SE, Apple\u2019s sales pitch was essentially that you could get the same basic phone in three different form factors. There were some minor differences. For example, the SE does\u2019t have 3D Touch, and the iPhone 6 and 6s don\u2019t have optical image stabilisation. But the phone guts themselves, including processor, camera, GPU, are the same across the three devices. Phone size matters. Plenty of people like a super-large screen, but even more iPhone users opt for Apple\u2019s 13cm phone. That\u2019s probably partially because of price (the Plus model iPhones are $US100 ($131) more), but a lot of it comes down to how much phone a person really wants to deal with. For me, it\u2019s not even about the money. I\u2019ll spend the extra $US100 ($131) for the iPhone 7 Plus in exchange for that great camera. But as a petite woman with very small hands, I\u2019m incensed that I\u2019m going to have to buy the bigger phone if I want the latest and greatest. Consider this indignity: Kate Spade doesn\u2019t even make a wallet case for the bigger iPhone! In fact, a lot of women\u2019s fashion brands don\u2019t make wallet or purse-style cases for the larger iPhone. A back case, fine, but if you want a cute wristlet, you\u2019re SOL. Sad. More surprising is that they've convinced someone they need 256GB I take lots of photos and videos. I'd be happy with 256 GB. you don't know how many selfies and videos these girls take You also need the big one to get a full HD screen. I'd get an s7 edge, same size screen as big Apple, slightly bigger body than little apple. You could get a VR headset and a 256gb SD card and still be cheaper than the 256gb versions of apples phones. Mine hasn't caught fire yet! She wants the camera though. That said, she could potentially get a point and shoot and strap a colour Sony-Ericsson to the back. Then it's great photos and a tiny phone! I bought an S7 Edge. Used it for about 3 months and went back to iOS. I couldn't stand the edge or the incredibly buggy OS. I'm selling it and my iPhone to buy the new iPhone 7. The edge is a taste thing, I love it because it's different to 99% of other phones.  Android runs perfectly on mine. Had no issues after 5 months. I'd consider the upgrade for the camera, but I'm just not going near a plus, they're too big. So I'll stick with what I have until it starts to fail, or until apple put a fancy whizz bang camera in a phone of human proportions. I can't believe I logged in to point out you can buy a Kate Spade wallet case for the larger model. I bought one for my wife's iPhone 6 plus while in San Diego in May, but she knew about it from looking online. It's not the wristlet, but it is a flip style case which holds cards and money. It even has a mirror. At any rate I went through the exact decision making process as yourself, and opted for the 256gb 7 plus, purely for the camera. Couldn't not have the best model. Figure I'll get used to the size. If not - I'll let my wife have it and deal with my old 6 for another year. I love gadgets. I recently bought the iPhone SE 16GB and I am very satisfied. I mainly bought it due to the low price and for the updated camera. I also own an iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, and an iPhone 4. I travel a lot. The iPhone 5c has a global SIM card installed and my iPhone SE has an Australian prepaid SIM card installed for local use. For consumers like me, buying an iPhone is all about personal taste. Most people seem to like a larger phone these days, but some still desire a smaller phone. My desire for a smaller phone is due to that I own three Lenovo laptops that I use for about 90% of my online work and personal communication. I am writing this comment from a Lenovo T460s laptop right now. I am also a professional photographer and use a Nikon D810 DSLR and a Nikon 14-24 super wide angle lens for much of my photography work. I use this very expensive equipment to shoot photos in difficult conditions and mainly at night or indoors. For someone who is not a big computer user, or a photographer who shoots in difficult lighting conditions, like me, the new iPhone 7 is fantastic. It doubles as a phone and tablet, and produces DSLR quality photos in not so poor shooting conditions.  As for memory, both of my primary iPhones are 16GB and I hardly go over about 10GB because I transfer my photos to my laptop via Windows Explorer. I do this to backup my photos and clear out the memory on my iPhone as needed to free up space. I use the Apple iTunes iPhone sync to back up the phone and sync data as well, and run this as needed. I do not use the iCloud service. I do not store much music on my iPhones, as I have an iPod for that. I don't watch movies. I do take a ton of photos with my iPhones, but I download all my recent photos and save them on my laptops as necessary and then clear out the photos from the iPhones. I use Google Contact Sync to update my contacts on all of my iPhones and laptops. I enter new contact info first into my laptop, and then it automatically syncs to my iPhones. Because I do all of the above, 16GB is plenty for me. Is 16GB, or even 32GB, or 64GB plenty for you? Well, that depends on your personal situation and how you use your phone. Many users will not meet the conditions I meet above as an iPhone user, but if you do, you don't need as much memory as Apple wants you to have. But again, that is also a personal choice. Meanwhile I want an upgraded iPhone SE. The Plus is far too big for me to comfortably use and the regular iPhone is more manageable but I just prefer the smaller form factor. Then again I have an iPad mini which I prefer to use instead of a phone for most things. If it's not more than 1TB, it's not worth the change.

V\u000a\u000aA poll of over 2,300 adults commissioned by digital product and service studio 383 has revealed that Brits see Amazon as the brand that does the most to make their lives easier through digital technology. Well over 1 in 2 respondents said that Amazon was one of the most useful brands in their digital lives, while Google received 49% of votes from respondents and Apple 26%. The BBC was the best-performing non-digital-native brand in the 383 survey, with 29% of respondents voting it one of the brands most useful to their digital lives. The next best performing traditional brand was Marks & Spencer, which garnered votes from 8% of respondents. 383 commissioned the survey to mark the launch of its Useful Brands Playbook, a new publication which takes a practical look at how organisations can succeed in an era of changing customers, technology and culture. Says John Newbold, Co-Founder at 383: \u201cAmazon has won a place in Brits\u2019 hearts with its intensely customer-centric approach, and its ability to deliver a great customer experience around its core products. As you would expect, our research shows that there\u2019s a gap between the digital usefulness of \u2018native\u2019 online brands like Amazon and Google, and traditional brands like the BBC, M&S and Boots.  \u201cBut it also shows that that gap is closing \u2013 the BBC in particular has thrived by adopting digital ecosystem thinking and demonstrating a clear awareness of the types of digital customer experiences which enrich people\u2019s lives. Overall though, the message is clear: no brand can now afford to neglect designing and delivering great digital customer experiences \u2013 regardless of whether or not they\u2019re a technology company.\u201d     \u2013 ENDS \u2013 Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related). When he\u2019s not writing about the latest developments in the connected home, he\u2019s normally driving his little smart car round town.

p744
VResearchers from the UK and Spain have shown that spiders are capable of tuning their webs, allowing these eight-legged critters to receive specific information about their environment, including the presence of prey, potential mates and the structural condition of the web.\u000a\u000aImage: Pexels Similar to the strings of a finely tuned instrument, each strand of spider silk transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies, which propagates throughout the web. This allows spiders, who don\u2019t see very well, to sense the integrity of their webs, and to detect the presence of prey and mates. Scientist have known about this for years, but they weren\u2019t entirely sure about the precise characteristics of these vibrations, or if spiders had any control over this cool architectural feature. To learn more, researchers from Oxford University and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid explored the links between the material properties of spider webs and how vibrations propagate through the silken strands. Their study, which now appears in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, demonstrates that spiders can in fact tune their webs to transmit specific messages.  Above video: The web, in addition to catching prey, signals vibrations to the spider \u2014 who reacts almost instantly upon impact. Using high-powered lasers to measure the ultra-small vibrations, the researchers isolated three particular web features that allow spiders to turn their traps into data transmitters: Web tension, silk stiffness and overall web architecture. Importantly, spiders are able to manipulate all three of these characteristics. For example, both transverse waves (that is, waves that vibrate at right angles to the direction of its spread) and longitudinal waves (that is, waves that vibrate in the direction of propagation) can be adjusted, or tuned, by the spider when it adjusts the web\u2019s tension and the stiffness of the web\u2019s outer rim and spokes, known as the dragline. In fact, spider webs are so customisable, the researchers hypothesise that specific features of silk evolved for this very purpose. \u201c[We] propose that dragline silk [features] may have evolved as a control mechanism for these multifunctional fibres,\u201d write the authors in their study. \u201cThe various degrees of active influence on web engineering reveals the extraordinary ability of spiders to shape the physical properties of their self-made materials and architectures to affect biological [i.e. data transmission] functionality.\u201d So when a spider builds its web, it\u2019s not just constructing a trap and blindly hoping its design will lend itself well to the propagation of specific vibrations. Rather, the spider is working like a diligent engineer, building a stable web that performs its primary trapping function, while also optimising the web\u2019s ability to relay critical information. It\u2019s essentially constructing \u2014 and then fine-tuning \u2014 its web to be a multi-function device. At the same time, the spider has to constantly balance trade-offs between the structural integrity of the web and the web\u2019s ability to transmit signals at specific frequencies. Wow. Spiders are truly amazing. [Journal of the Royal Society Interface] These creepy buggers kick ass.\u000aI really want a tarantula but fear says no.

VA river near an industrial town in Russia has turned suddenly blood-red. But it\u2019s not an omen of something mystical wrong in the cosmos. Rather, the source of the problem is probably a leaky factory upstream.\u000a\u000aNorilsk River, yesterday (Images: left: slipakolga / Instagram; top right:basalyga_katerina_nl / Instagram; bottom right: berezowskyvova / Instagram ) Several photos of the river\u2019s blood-red hue were captured on Instagram by residents around Norilsk, Russia yesterday. Although the precise cause of the change isn\u2019t yet confirmed, The Siberian Times reports that it\u2019s happened a number of times before, and that pollution from a nickel factory on the river is believed to be the cause. Norilsk Nickel, the company that owns the factory, so far denies that a leak in its plant is responsible for leaching colour into the river. But Russia\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology said in a statement that it does believe a leaking slurry pipeline in the factory is the source and has ordered an investigation.  \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u0432 #\u041d\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u270c\U0001f3fc\ufe0f #\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c2016 , #\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439, #\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\u043b\u044c A photo posted by \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 (@slipakolga) on Sep 5, 2016 at 10:51pm PDT   \u0421\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0443 \u0441 \u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430. #\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e #\u041d\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a #\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430\u0445 #\u041a\u0430\u0439\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043d #\u0434\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 #\u044d\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f #\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430  \u0410\u0448 #\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0448\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e.  \u0410 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0435\u0449\u0435 #\u0433\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0430 #\u044f\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u2026.

VHordes of lionfish have been roaming the Atlantic for several decades now, and their voracious appetite \u2014 and lack of natural predators \u2014 has seriously upset the ecological balance of those waters. Now there\u2019s a new foundation devoted to building robots to hunt them down \u2014 a Terminator for lionfish.\u000a\u000aThe lionfish, AKA \u201cDarwin\u2019s nightmare\u201d, is upsetting the ecological balance in the Atlantic. (Image: Dennis Jacobsen/Shutterstock The prototypes under development are technically cousins to robotic vacuum cleaners, because iRobot CEO Colin Angle is one of the founders of Robots in the Service of the Environment (RISE). He and his wife, biochemist Erika Ebbel, were visiting friends in Bermuda, and the group went diving one day, along with a marine specimen collector named Chris Flook. It was Flook who regaled them with stories of the invasive lionfish, and RISE was born \u2014 a Skynet for lionfish. Lionfish have been dubbed \u201cDarwin\u2019s nightmare\u201d because of their tremendous adaptability. They are flexible in what they eat, they can thrive in many different environments (salt water or fresh, cold water or warm), and they reproduce like crazy, all year round, rather than having a particular breeding season. Plus they have venomous spikes, discouraging potential predators from eating them in turn. That makes lionfish a particularly problematic invasive species. Originally from the Indo-Pacific region, the bright stripes and frilly fins of the lionfish made it a popular choice for exotic pet owners. Those same owners likely dumped adult lionfish into public waters in the mid-1980s, and the species reproduced like gangbusters, with devastating ecological results. 3D rendering of a prototype Harvester Lionfish Hunter to zap the fish with electricity. (Image: Ed Williams/Robo Nautica] In the Bahamas, for instance, lionfish devoured parrotfish and other smaller species that consume plants, the better to keep algae growth in check. Without them, algae bloomed freely and choked the coral reef ecosystems. \u201cThe only thing that we can do is try to eat them,\u201d marine biologist Christie Wilcox \u2014 author of a new book called Venomous: How Earth\u2019s Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry \u2014 told Gizmodo. Because they are venomous \u2014 as opposed to poisonous \u2014 they are perfectly edible. \u201cLionfish venom is largely proteins, which are easily denatured [when cooked],\u201d said Wilcox, and you can even eat them uncooked, as in a ceviche. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t stab yourself along the way, you can theoretically swallow a spine freshly cut from a lionfish and be fine.\u201d She\u2019s sampled lionfish herself, in various preparations. \u201cIt\u2019s a flaky, white, sort of sweet fish,\u201d she said. There\u2019s definitely a growing market for lionfish in the US: Whole Foods sells fillets in certain geographical areas, as do several sea-to-table restaurants in Florida and North Carolina, in particular. But lionfish have to be speared by hand; they lurk in coral reefs, avoiding dragging nets, and they don\u2019t fall for the old bait-on-a-hook trick of pole fishing, either. Spearing them one by one is the only option \u2014 and that\u2019s a tedious and time-consuming process. That\u2019s where RISE\u2019s prototype robotic harvesters can help. The first model uses a pressure-powered spear gun to humanely hunt lionfish, which should start field tests this month. A second prototype is designed to zap the lionfish with electricity, thanks to a robotic arm rigged out with two metal electrodes. \u201cWhen the probes get to either side of the fish, you basically zap it,\u201d RISE executive director Joe Rizzo told PBS Newshour. The two prototypes include video cameras, so that pilots can guide the robots through the water, but the ultimate goal is to build autonomous underwater robots to hunt lionfish.  [Nanowerk News] It's the beginning of the end... Didn't someone try this with cane-toads? Skynet would be proud. "Why stop at making it autonomous? Lets make it able to self replicate!"

p752
VStar Trek: The Original Series has a lot of great episodes, running the gamut from the emotionally devastating (\u201cThe City on the Edge of Forever\u201d) to the comedic (\u201cThe Trouble With Tribbles\u201d). And yet, for my money, no episode is a better example of everything the Original Series got right than \u201cJourney to Babel\u201d.\u000a\u000aImage: CBS via Trek Core Some great Trek episodes, like \u201cThe City on the Edge of Forever\u201d, don\u2019t necessarily need to be Star Trek in order to be good. Certainly, they are enriched by taking place in an established universe with characters we already know and sympathise with, but the core of the story could be told anywhere. Everything in \u201cJourney to Babel\u201d, however \u2014 regardless of the characterisation, the drama, the world-building and the humour \u2014 could only belong to Star Trek. The plot revolves around a bunch of dignitaries being shuttled by the Enterprise to a meeting to vote on a planet\u2019s entry to the Federation; the Vulcan ambassador and his wife happen to be Spock\u2019s parents. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a mystery vessel following the Enterprise. The first plot point means getting a better look at Federation politics, which includes introducing the Andorians and the Tellarites. It\u2019s strongly implied that the Tellarites are against the planet\u2019s admission because they can only exploit its resources if it\u2019s not protected by Starfleet. It\u2019s such a small thing, but it reminds us that what we see on the Enterprise isn\u2019t going on everywhere in the universe, and that the Federation is a coalition of many planets and not just a home for humans. (Later instalments\u2026 forgot this.) The second element of the episode, Spock\u2019s parents, focuses on the personal. Spock\u2019s Vulcan father Sarek has a heart problem that flares up while he\u2019s on the Enterprise. He needs Spock\u2019s blood to get the operation, but, for some reason, Spock\u2019s contribution to this surgery would require him to be put under. This wouldn\u2019t normally be a problem, but someone just tried to kill Kirk and he\u2019s incapacitated; given the delicate situation, Spock doesn\u2019t see the logic in saving one man and endangering the mission. (Everyone acts like putting Scotty in charge would doom everyone. Possible, but still, harsh.) The scenes with Spock\u2019s parents are perfect Trek. Jane Wyatt and Mark Lenard deserve so much praise for their portrayals of human Amanda and Sarek the Vulcan. The tension between Sarek and Spock is evident, even though they aren\u2019t technically acting emotionally. And Amanda\u2019s tearful recounting of her half-Vulcan son being bullied as a child is beautifully done, as is her slap after Spock chooses to take command of the Enterprise instead of saving his endangered father. After I made this gif, my soul ascended to heaven, having finally glimpsed perfection. It took all of J.J. Abrams\u2019 first Star Trek movie to do with Spock\u2019s character what this episode accomplished in just a few scenes. You understand implicitly that Spock is very much like his father, even though he made decisions that Sarek really, truly felt were wrong. The third bit, the mystery ship, gives us Kirk in all his glory. Nothing is more Kirk than him pretending to be healthy enough to command the ship so that his friend can save his father\u2019s life. That\u2019s how the plot with Sarek needing surgery gets resolved: Kirk intends to fake health just long enough for Spock to go to sickbay. It gets extra Kirk-y when the mystery ship attacks just as he hauls his nearly collapsing arse into the captain\u2019s chair. The final act of \u201cJourney to Babel\u201d should be shown to anyone trying to write Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Even in bad shape, Kirk manages to save the day. Spock figures out a plot to sabotage the vote right as he\u2019s about to be sedated. And McCoy just wants everyone to stop running around and talking so they can heal.  My version of heaven is this scene, on a loop. And it doesn\u2019t even include to the part earlier in the episode where Amanda embarrasses Spock by telling his friends about his childhood pet. If D.C. Fontana had just done this episode, she\u2019d have made an invaluable contribution. But she was also the story editor on the series, rewrote episodes and wrote her own. While being a young woman working in the \u201960s. You can tell from this episode just how invaluable her understanding of this universe was. While there are episodes of the Original Series that are better examples of the science fiction allegory the show became famous for, this is the best example of why Trek itself, as a universe, is worth watching.

VJapan\u2019s NTT Docomo\u2019s ambitious 5G launch plans include live streaming of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo While many areas of the UK still haven\u2019t got 4G coverage, mobile phone companies are already gearing up for the fifth generation of mobile phone technology which will make our data connections even faster and our smart phones even smarter than ever before.  But what is 5G and why do you need it? Tech Digest reports.   On Tuesday Nokia previewed a presentation it plans to make at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona later this month, detailing its vision for 5G technology. The company is aiming to be one of the world\u2019s largest 5G players when the technology is eventually rolled out to the consumer, probably in 2020 according to The Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance. But what will 5G actually mean for the consumer, many of whom haven\u2019t even got 4G yet. \u201c5G is going to be faster, smarter and less power-hungry mobile broadband,\u201d explains Narayan Menon, Founder and CTO of Engineering at XCellAir. \u201cIt means \u201cgiga\u201d data rates with super-low transmission delays; being able to download a high-definition movie in seconds versus minutes with 4G; a hugely improved content viewing experience; faster smartphones; and a variety of longer-lasting wearable devices. All delivered seamlessly while on the move \u2013 whether you\u2019re commuting, travelling or stationary.\u201d Sounds great doesn\u2019t it? 1. It will be faster (of course)  Well that\u2019s taken as a given these days. Nokia claims that it has tested a 5G connection with download speeds of up to 30 gigabits per second. That\u2019s more than 1,000 times faster than your average 4G connection. In the real world, though, there\u2019s very little chance of your mobile phone actually getting speeds that fast. Trees, buildings, your distance from a mast and other customers trying to use the mobile phone network are going to slow down speeds dramatically compared to what Nokia was able to achieve in a lab. Nevertheless the wireless industry is still expecting 5G to be really fast: 10 to 100 times faster according to Brian Daly, director of government standards at AT&T who speaking at a panel on 5G wireless technologies held by the CTIA wireless association in Washington, US on Tuesday. Those faster speeds will also allow more customers to be connected at the same time, giving the network more capacity and making connections more reliable for mobile customers. 2. It will make cars safer to drive! Nokia\u2019s 5G forecast makes some bold claims including this one. Currently self-driving test cars are powered by wireless networks. One problem with wireless technology that\u2019s already emerged is that there\u2019s a large amount of latency, or lag, between the car\u2019s sensor and the data centre sending information to the car. Worst case scenario is that this could cause a car to crash. One of 5G\u2019s biggest promises is ultra-low latency, delivering uninterrupted communication flow to driverless cars. That could dramatically improve vehicle safety and reduce congestion. When self-drivng cars do become a reality (and they will),  they\u2019ll have to identify an obstacle and immediately communicate that to the data centre, and receive instructions from the cloud, with virtually no latency whatsoever in order to be safe. 3. Ultra High definition video/Faster downloading Thanks largely to wireless technology, most of us now use our mobile phones to stream video from the internet and for downloading video content. Many of even use 4G for video streaming. However with 5G, video streaming will become even more widespread with even greater speeds and data allowances for customers. For example it will be possible to stream feed of a football match in Ultra HD or a concert in real-time on your smartphone or tablet. You could even switch the camera angle and get truly instant replay. What\u2019s more, the video would be in stunning 4K, about four-times the resolution of HD. That will all be possible with a 5G network, Nokia believes. At last year\u2019s MWC, Japan\u2019s NTT DoCoMo said it aims have a 5G network up and running in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. 4. Increased automation and networked robots Robotic surgical tools can be incredibly useful machines for doctors. But they need to react in real-time as soon as the doctor issues a command. The same goes for robots that perform complex manufacturing commands, which need to communicate instantly with other robots on the assembly line via the IoT (Internet of Things). Nokia predicts that 5G\u2019s low latency should help to allow networked robots to perform even more complicated tasks in the future. 5. Virtual reality With 5G, Nokia believes virtual reality users \u201cwill be able to collaborate as if they are in the same physical location.\u201d It could even usher in a new era of video games and remote collaboration, reckons Marcus Weldon, chief technology officer at Nokia: \u201c5G will give birth to the next phase of human possibilities, bringing about the automation of everything,\u201d He adds: \u201cThis automation, driven by a smart, invisible network, will create new businesses, give rise to new services and, ultimately, free up more time for people.\u201d  Want to find out more about what 5G can offer?

p756
VNo matter how fast medicine moves us towards treatments, preventive medicine will always be the most effective and cheapest way to keep healthy. Yesterday, we went over the most common screenings for women. Today we\u2019ll look at men\u2019s health screenings, when you should get them, and what kind of experience you\u2019re in for.\u000a Not surprisingly, men and women can look forward to different screening tests throughout their lifetime. In today\u2019s case we can solidly notch a point in the \u201cbetter to be a man\u201d column: There is only one recommended screening test for men of average risk (i.e. with no personal or family medical history). That, of course, excludes routine things checked during your annual primary care visit (blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, urinalysis, abdominal circumference, physical exam, etc) or behaviour related screenings (STIs, lung cancer). Those tests are all absolutely critical to maintaining your health \u2014 don\u2019t skimp on them just because you think heart disease doesn\u2019t seem as scary as bowel cancer. But in terms of recommended screening for cancer and other diseases, you pretty much have a fecal test or a colonoscopy to look forward to. Sad, I know. As always, final decisions about your personal care should be made after a conversation between you and your physician. Not after a quick perusal of the internet. What is it? Most people associate bowel cancer screening with colonoscopies \u2014 a multipurpose test that can screen for bowel cancer, ulcers, polyps, and bleeding. There are actually a few methods of testing for bowel cancer, each with a different screening recommendation. The unique advantage of the colonoscopy is that it visualizes the entire colon and allows for tissue sampling and removal of polyps as appropriate. There are also several screening tests that look for blood in the stool, a possible sign of bowel cancer. What does it feel like? I had to outsource this question. For the colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy prep, the almost universal responses were either \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. There\u2019s just so much poop.\u201d For the colonoscopy itself, most people are sedated so you will have no memory of the experience. Because the sigmoidoscope does not travel as far up the digestive tract, patients are awake through the procedure. This was described \u201clike someone is snaking a pipe\u2026only it\u2019s your rectum.\u201d For the faecal occult blood screening test (FOBT), the Cancer Council advises that the test involves taking samples from two or three bowel motions using a test kit. This is painless, but kind of gross. These are analysed at a pathology laboratory, and if blood is detected, further tests may be required. When Should I Get It? The Cancer Council recommends a non-invasive test for low risk men. In all cases, if a test is positive, further exam via colonoscopy is required. Doctors recommend screening every two years, beginning at age 50. Free test kits can be sent to patients at age 50, 55, 60, 64, 65, 70, 72 or 74 years of age, with these increments changing to every two years, starting in 2020. The Cancer Council states that their preferred screening test for polyps and cancer is a colonoscopy, for people with a higher risk of developing bowel cancer. What is it? Traditionally, men would regularly receive a digital rectal exam (DRE) and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test to screen for prostate cancer in patients without symptoms. During the DRE, the doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel for growths or bumps. The PSA is a blood test that looks for a protein produced by the prostate that may be elevated in cases of cancer. What does it feel like? The doctor will typically have you bend over the table (there are other possible positions if you are are unable to stand that way) and insert their gloved finger into your rectum, probing around for any masses or anything out of the ordinary. The test will usually last under a minute \u2014 you may feel some mild discomfort but there shouldn\u2019t be any pain. Awkward small talk may be involved. While they\u2019re up there, many doctors will follow the exam with a FOBT to look for blood in your stool (a possible signifier of other non-prostate cancer problems) The PSA is a blood test, so that feels like a finger prick. When Should I Get It? Previously, PSAs have been recommended yearly after 50 years of age and for those with a family history of cancer. More recently however, experts have recognised that the harms of this testing may outweigh the benefits. The PSA test may deliver falsely positive results (level elevated but no cancer), leading to unnecessary anxiety and additional testing. A positive PSA test may also find small tumours that are not causing symptoms, but this may not reduce the chances of dying from prostate cancer. The resulting overtreatment, which may include surgery or radiation, can result in potential harmful side effects and complications. The Cancer Council recommends that people discuss the possible risks and benefits of testing with their doctor before making any decisions on testing. The discussion should start at age 50 for men of average risk, age 45 for men of high risk, and age 40 for those of very high risk. Screening is repeated annually or every 2 years, depending on the results. This last one is prevention rather than screening, but many parents don\u2019t realise that their children are eligible for the HPV vaccine so I want to mention it here. There are vaccines that protect against the cancer and genital wart causing strains of HPV. While earlier vaccination is ideal (it is recommended after age 11), the vaccine is recommended for women through the age of 26. This is a vaccine that prevents cancer. Man, woman, boy, girl \u2014 if you\u2019re eligible and don\u2019t have it, go get it. Most importantly, if you have any concerns or have a family history of cancer, we highly recommend that you discuss it with your doctor, or call the Cancer Council on 13 11 20 for more information.

VSay goodbye to your waistlines, and hello to eating a ridiculous amount of cheeseburgers in an attempt to win, well, more cheeseburgers (also maybe a car). That\u2019s right, McDonald\u2019s Monopoly is back! And this time it has a mobile game to go along with it.   I know, I know, the chances of winning anything substantial (fries don\u2019t count) are pretty minimal, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that McDonald\u2019s has worked out a way to gamify one of the things I am really, really good at \u2014 eating.  Have you ever won anything in McDonald\u2019s Monopoly? Tell us in the comments! Rewards axed to sh*t year-on-year, prices of food way over the top, size of food significantly reduced year-on-year.  It's pretty obvious Macas hates their customers. If you go back to 1991, I won a microwave oven in their trivial pursuit competition.  Even remember the question - which state or territory capital city was named after a city in Scotland?  Think the options were Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Perth, and Darwin. Was a nice unit, think it was worth around $1000 at the time.  Lasted about a decade. Someone won a car last time and they refused to honour it. Horrible. wow Woah, really? I didn't hear about that! They ran the game once. Few years later they ran it again. For some unknown reason, a whole heap of people had kept their tickets from the first game. A bunch of people tried to claim stuff using a mix of tickets. However, there was a pretty clear difference. There was a big M in the middle of all the new tickets (or maybe it was the old ones) but it was pretty clear. One girl, got the car with all new tickets and they failed to honour it. It was in the news and stuff. IIRC, there was also a fair bit going on (possibly refusals) because McDonald's just started claiming people were trading tickets, without proof of course. Was that against the rules? They way I understood the game to work was that most of the cool prizes had a heap of common tickets but there was one that was super rare that you needed to complete the set to win it. I would have thought they would have only printed enough for the number or prizes they had. It's not about the winning, it's about the eating; oops I mean playing. But I like free fries. But unlike this game, the HJ app allows you to win on the spot, without needing to buy anything.

V\u000aSeems that Smart TVs \u2013 those that can access online video content \u2013 are proving a bit hit with consumers. Samsung, one of the leading Smart TV manufacturers, is claiming that it has recently passed 2.5 million weekly visitors to its \u2018Smart Hub\u2019 portal, a rise of 33 per cent over the past six months. Smart TV users can now access Ultra High Definition content from the likes of Netflix as well as enjoying the benefits of the Catch Up TV from BBC iPlayer, the ITV Hub etc. Samsung\u2019s platform also offers curated and independent world cinema from the likes of MUBI and Curzon Home Cinema and family oriented content including Hopster and Ketchup TV. Rhian James, Content Product Manager at Samsung Electronics UK & Ireland, says: \u201c2015 was an exciting year for content, we have seen a significant shift in the way people consume content which has been reflected in the remarkable growth in users of the Samsung Smart Hub over the past year. People are engaging with the content we have to offer more than ever and as the number one TV brand in the UK, we at Samsung want to ensure that we are offering consumers the widest choice of content possible. We are pleased to be working with an amazing range of partners to extend our quality offering, giving our Smart TV users access to the content they want more of.\u2018\u2019     Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

ViOS 10 is arriving next Tuesday, but if you have the patience of a teenager, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s possible to upgrade to iOS 10 right now.\u000a iOS 10 has been available in the beta program for a while and Apple sent out the final version of iOS 10 to beta testers this morning. If you\u2019re in the beta program, head over to Settings > General > Software Update and you\u2019ll get upgraded to the final version of iOS 10. This is the easiest way to update your phone now as long as you\u2019re already enrolled in the program. If you\u2019re not, head over to Apple\u2019s sign up page and see if you can still enroll. If you don\u2019t want to mess around with the beta program because it\u2019s a bit of a pain to leave, you can still download the final version of iOS 10 right now. You\u2019ll just need to jump through a couple hoops. Before you upgrade, make sure you back up your device with iTunes or on iCloud (or both, if you\u2019re extra worried). Unlike previous early-upgrades, you won\u2019t have to restore your phone this time around, but it\u2019s still a good idea to have current backups in case something goes wrong. As always, things can change before the final public release, so if you\u2019re not comfortable potentially screwing something up, just wait until Tuesday. With recent changes to how the developer accounts work, it\u2019s now possible to download and install the \u201cgold master\u201d versions (which should be the exact same as the final, public release) directly from Apple. This is great news! The catch is that you have to be on a Mac and you have to install Xcode 8 first. If you do not install Xcode 8 first, you will get an error message and your phone will be wiped, so do not skip this step. Once that\u2019s all out of the way, it\u2019s time to actually update your iOS device. Apple\u2019s released iOS 10.0.1 to developers, which is currently listed as the \u201cgold master\u201d version of iOS 10. Find your device on the list below and click the link to download an iOS 10 IPSW file for your device. If any of the below links don\u2019t work for some reason, you can find a list at the iPhone Wiki. With the proper IPSW file for iOS 10 downloaded and Xcode 8 installed, you can now install it on your iOS device. That\u2019s it, from there, iTunes will update your device to iOS 10 and assuming no bugs are found between now and the final release on Tuesday, you should be good to go. You don't need Xcode 8 or even a Mac to get iOS 10. Just sign up to the Beta program, the follow the links (on your phone) to their iOS10 beta page. You can install a certificate which then enables direct update to iOS 10 on your phone via Settings > General > Software update. I did it this morning and it worked perfectly. Do you have to backup before doing this method?

VVideo: The kills have been counted \u2014 now it\u2019s time for Bat-smooches. Turns out the Dark Knight (or really, his alter-ego) spent quite a bit of his time in between beating the crap out of bad guys engaging in intimate relations.\u000a\u000aThis fun little mash-up video from Maurice Mitchell sticks to Batman\u2019s live-action appearances, and unsurprisingly there\u2019s a lot more kissing going on when Batman is Bruce Wayne rather than when he\u2019s in his bat-gear. And also, Adam West\u2019s Batman did a lot less kissing than you might have expected!  There\u2019s a few in there that are a bit circumspect \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that Catwoman lick should count \u2014 but it\u2019s still a fun watch. Also, you begin to notice just how often the cowl pokes its sharp nose into someone\u2019s cheek mid-moment of Bat-passion. Probably why he does more of his flirting outside of the Batman costume, really.

VWhen most people think of Star Trek, they of course think of Kirk and Spock. This isn\u2019t surprising, as they were the star and the break-out character of the series, but it\u2019s easy to forget that they were two members of a triumvirate that made up the essence of the show. Ship\u2019s doctor Leonard \u201cBones\u201d McCoy was the third, and just as integral in making Star Trek a joy to watch.  While Spock was all cold logic and Kirk was fiery passion, Bones was the heart of the Enterprise crew. He was the one who made the plea to do the right thing, who reminded the others of the potential cost of obeying logic or the Prime Directive. McCoy also was the true audience surrogate of the show, saying the things we yelled at the TV. The crew of the Enterprise did run into some completely ridiculous phenomena, and none of it would have worked if McCoy wasn\u2019t there to say \u201cOf course you save their lives, you idiots!\u201d and \u201cHow in the universe is this happening to us?\u201d What makes Bones so fascinating is that he clearly didn\u2019t want to be there. He wasn\u2019t a full believer in the Starfleet mission. He hated space and ships and Starfleet, but he went out there and did his job every single time, no matter what insanity he encountered. Remember \u201cThe Devil in the Dark?\u201d Can you imagine starting out life as a doctor in your home state and then finding yourself being asked to treat this? McCoy complained, but he did it. Because he was a doctor and that was his job. And Kirk ordered him to. McCoy\u2019s history isn\u2019t epic and tragic like Kirk\u2019s or unique like Spock\u2019s. Which is why he, despite being an actual genius, insisted over and over that he was just a country doctor. And when I say McCoy complained, I mean he complained all the time. About everything, but mostly Spock. Just think about how much life Star Trek would have lost without Bones for Kirk to talk to or for Spock to spar with: \u000aSpock: I\u2019m happy the affair is over. A most annoying emotional episode. McCoy: Smack right in the old heart. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. [pointing to his side] In your case, it would be about here. Spock: The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours, Doctor, pleases me no end.\u000a (I would literally watch Spock and McCoy trade barbs over any other duo in all of Star Trek\u2018s 50 years.) In between insults, grumpiness, and straight-up bitching, McCoy was also responsible for delivering messages about the human condition more than anyone else on the show. Kirk had the mission, Spock his logic, but what McCoy cared about was his patients \u2014 and that made him closer to people than he was to anything else. One of Star Trek\u2019s primary messages is about the importance of the balance within ourselves. (It\u2019s why several episodes revolve around characters splitting into two halves.) McCoy was an integral part of that equation for TOS, just like DeForest Kelley was integral is making Bones the perfect mix of grumpy and compassionate, prickly but still so essentially humane. Kelley may not have received the same level of fame as William Shatner or Leonard Nimoy, and Bones might not have gotten the flashiest scenes. But Dr. McCoy was still the heart of the whole show, and it would have never taken off without him. Bones may not have wanted to be in space at all, but thank goodness he was.

VStar Trek could have been gayer. But in the \u201980s I didn\u2019t care. I was twee and my biggest Star Trek concern in 1987 was where the hell Sulu and Uhura were and why was there a small bald British man wearing a red shirt on the bridge. But later\u2026 later I wanted to know where the gay was. Stuff close to my heart, you know?\u000a To that end, growing up in the \u201980s and \u201990s wasn\u2019t easy, especially if you were a Trekkie. There was that one episode where Riker falls in love with an agender person (played by a woman) and then everyone condemns the super heteronormative people for being in love. And there was that other episode where Crusher\u2019s Trill boyfriend gets dropped into Riker (who she bangs), and then a woman (who she does not bang). But where TNG was deeply heteronormative and borderline homophobic, DS9 was a fresh, if brief, breath of air. Back in 1995, when \u201cRejoined\u201d aired there was no Puppy Episode of Ellen and Xena hadn\u2019t yet planted a confusing one on Gabrielle while she was in Bruce Campbell\u2019s body. In 1995, two ladies kissing on TV was damned daring. But I was 12 and it was also damn confusing, and when it ends with the two women apart and Dax never mentioning her lover across ages again it kind of put a cap on things. Later, I would find Seven of Nine and her terse conversations with Janeway in Voyager interesting, but by then I was in high school, Buffy and X-Files and ER were my life and Star Trek was just that show I tuned into on Wednesday when I didn\u2019t have debate or theatre. More time passed. And then one day in 2008 I was farting around on Memory Alpha, Star Trek\u2018s exhaustive, crowd-sourced wiki, and came across a fun factoid I\u2019d previously only seen as rumours on Livejournals. According to fandom lore, Seven of Nine was originally supposed to be gay. In fact, some instances of the story say that producers created Seven of Nine as a romantic foil for Janeway, but at the last minute they chickened out and veered the relationship into familial territory instead. Then, the rumours insisted, the actresses chose to play it gay as a big FU to those who had backed down. As the person who rewatched all of Xena because my sister said Renee O\u2019Connor was actually taller than Lucy Lawless, I felt a challenge brewing and I accepted. I rewatched Voyager in it\u2019s entirety, descending down a terrible rabbit hole into a show about a scientist who has a mental breakdown when she and her crew are stranded thousands of lightyears from home, and the weird woman raised by an asexual robot collective in space. Like all the best Trek stories, Voyager leaned hard on the Western tropes I adore. Seven was the foundling girl and Janeway the school marm dumped in the wilderness (Westerns, being a profoundly masculine genre, usually kill those women or drive them insane). I wasn\u2019t quite sure what blossomed between them was love, though. But there was a fierce passion in their every exchange \u2014 something vibrant and apart from the otherwise bland Voyager. Seven pushed and prodded and Janeway, arch in her superiority, pushed right back. The gayness flickers in the little moments, which as a lover of X-Files and Xena I was accustomed to searching for. I didn\u2019t look for lip locks, just those moments when they were in the frame together, touches that lasted too long, lingering gazes, or those instances when they\u2019d risk life and limb and even the ship for one another. The show progressed and these women\u2019s best episodes were often wrapped up in one another and it was wonderful to watch. Star Trek is such an enduring collection of stories that it\u2019s a world that\u2019s easy to fantasize about, but it\u2019s been woefully inept when it comes to some stories. Women never found each other \u2014 they never lasted \u2014 in a Star Trek tale. And Seven and Janeway didn\u2019t last either. Instead, Seven was snatched from both Janeway\u2019s affection and the Doctor\u2019s, and thrust into the arms of Chakotay (that was due to a dare Chakotay\u2019s actor, Robert Beltran, issued to the writers to write a scene where he got to kiss actress Jeri Ryan). It\u2019s routinely considered one of the dumbest storylines on the show \u2014 which is impressive, given that Voyager once had a plot line so bad it was stricken from canon. But the close bond between Janeway and Seven stuck around through the final episode (and, I\u2019m told, also through the books). The finale of the show is about an elderly Janeway taking a dump on the Temporal Prime Directive and travelling back in time to save Seven\u2019s life. It\u2019s as romantic as the end of Star Trek would ever get. While every other Trek finale seems to be about the tragedy of love, Voyager is about the missed opportunities of love, which is so damn gratifying. For nearly a decade now, queer Star Trek fans have had to be content with subtext and tragedy, which is all we\u2019ve been given. But it won\u2019t be that way much longer. Bryan Fuller, a gay man who likes to pack his sharp adaptations of pre-existing material with super gay moments, is producing the next Star Trek show, Discovery, and he\u2019s made it clear he\u2019s going to bring the queer. It only took 51 years, but in 2017 Star Trek will finally break down a barrier left up too long. There will be a consistently queer primary character on the best science fiction property out there. This has been somehow Star Trek has sorely needed, and for a very long time: Real gay characters that don\u2019t require a squint and a head tilt, that get to be fully fleshed out and allowed to live (don\u2019t fucking do it Fuller). This is momentous. It changes the game. It tells us that the most inclusive series out there no longer has a blindspot for all us queer folks. I\u2019m just sorry it wasn\u2019t you, Seven. I'll be interested to see how they handle the vast difference between the Federations views on homosexuality and the modern homosexual perspective. Star Trek is so far beyond issues like gay marriage, the right to have kids, etc that the show can't really discuss them in any direct way. They can make two men kiss but the idea of two men kissing has almost been redefined. It would be weird if they had a crew member show any discomfort with it. It's been stripped of any trace of abnormality so to them it's as normal as two people with blue eyes kissing. At this point two different species having kids is on par with a tall hippy and a short conservative having kids.\u000aIn theory they're going to have to portray homosexuality as the most normal thing in the world which I think may end up feeling like a betrayal or cop out. Oddly enough it may feel less relateable than the subtext heavy stuff of the past. That'll be a real shame because that's where Star Trek shines. That's why I prefer TNG's approach. Tell a tale of discrimination that has parallels to modern society but is it's own thing. It's clumsy and stupid but at the same time brilliant. The genderless race episode of TNG showcases a bunch of really relateable aspects of growing up different without the baggage of directly weighing into the debates of the day. It's ending leaves anybody, even homophobes, thinking about how violating it is to force someone to change, even if you believe you're fixing them.\u000aNot only that but it takes away the ability to fall back on the 'it's wrong because it's wrong,' 'sanctity of marriage' or 'God doesn't like it' reasoning. It removes the pre-prepared statements. It's just a few degrees different from reality, but it's enough that if you want to disagree with it you've got to think about it. Challenging a mind this way, especially a young mind that's been trained to think a certain way, is very effective. I think that's what causes such a strong love of Star Trek. Non-sense stories that resonate with anyone who ever felt like a misfit, regardless of why they felt like a misfit, set in a universe where quality of character trumps fitting into any pre-defined boxes.\u000aStrip away reality, leave the emotion/humanity and you can reach just about anyone. Couple it with Star Trek's generally conservative views and positive stance on the future and you're making the sort of art that makes the world a better place. I really don't see the point of putting gay people in the script just for the sake of the modern zeitgeist.  I have no issue with homosexuality at all, however, the ratio of gay to non-gay in any given population is very low, so if they aren't in the show it isn't because they don't exist.  Maybe they could have gay extras instead.

VFacebook wasn\u2019t the only one who saw millions of its dollars go up in smoke when a SpaceX rocket exploded on a Cape Canaveral launch pad last Thursday. Facebook was actually making use of a satellite operated by Spacecom, an Israeli-based satellite operator, in it\u2019s attempt to expand internet use on the entire continent of Africa.  And now that that satellite is just a pile of vaporized junk, Spacecom, according to Reuters, would like SpaceX to pony up $US50 ($66) million dollars. Or give the company a free trip on a future rocket. In addition to demanding money from SpaceX, Spacecom is also collecting $US205 ($271) million from Israel Aircraft Industries, who built the satellite that went up in flames. Spacecom\u2019s request for compensation is the first official one from a satellite owner involved with Thursday\u2019s explosion. While Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the explosion, Facebook has not yet announced what it plans to do next. Unlike Spacecom, who has been in the satellite business for over twenty years, Facebook is brand new to interstellar launches, and had put quite a bit of hope into its investment in Spacecom\u2019s satellite. [Reuters] Might want to take a look at the footage. Looked like the problem started with the satellite. Dodgy con job eh? Nah, looking slowly at the footage, it was the fueling of the second stage booster - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye0EOENUw0c I didn't watch the full video but I like to jump to conclusions so I'm going to look at the clouds and the intensity of the flash and say static discharge ignited the liquid hydrogen. Guess you can't insure your kit going into space... You can, but it costs a lot.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_insurance Yeah, but it costs a lot because it's liability-free, all the way through. If SpaceX is liable for the damage to the satellite, they're working on a very different contract basis to any other launch provider. And all this will do is hamper future efforts because they will be scared of getting sued. They knew the risks, deal with it. and when another launch company rocket fails, Hey it's OK we don't need $50 Million.\u000aevery satellite launch is covered by insurance. 93% non failed!! this is all a BEATUP, if you didnt have insurance you loser, space is risky, they knew it....it just media hype and bs yet again.

VRaspberry Pi3 is released today, February 29th, 2016, complete with integrated Bluetooth and WiFi Today is the Raspberry Pi\u2019s fourth birthday, and along with birthday wishes, we\u2019re welcoming their newest addition on board, the new Pi 3.  The new credit card sized model sized goes on sale today priced $35/£30, the same price as its predecessor. Whereas in previous versions, the Pi needed USB adapters to get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, Raspberry Pi 3 supports 802.11n Wi-Fi (2.4GHz only) and Bluetooth 4.0 without an adapter, freeing up its four USB ports for other purposes. Also while the Raspberry Pi 2 released a year ago used a Broadcom system-on-chip with a 32-bit, 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex A7, the new Raspberry Pi 3 upgrades to a 64-bit ARM Cortex A53 that\u2019s also quad-core and is clocked at 1.2GHz. The device is expected to be about 50 percent faster than the previous version due to the increase in clock speeds and architectural improvements, Raspberry Pi creator Eben Upton told tech blog Ars Technica. \u201cThe main reason we\u2019re excited about Cortex A53 is it\u2019s a better 32-bit processor [than A7]. You can run in 32-bit mode,\u201d Upton said. 64-bit ARM processors also support a new ARMv8 instruction set that\u2019s capable of speeding up both 32-bit and 64-bit operations. While the 64-bit capability means that 64-bit operating systems could come to the Pi, there are no specific plans yet, Upton said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to wait until someone can demonstrate a concrete benefit to going to 64-bit before we make that our standard,\u201d he said. The new Pi has 1GB of RAM, the same amount as last year. For RAM usage, 64-bit is only necessary if you have more than 4GB. Pi 3 also has a graphics upgrade, using Broadcom\u2019s 400MHz VideoCore IV, rather than last year\u2019s 250MHz version. The new hardware will support 1080p video at 60fps using the H.264 format, up from 30fps. It also gains H.265 support for the first time, but limited to 1080p at 30fps. Remarkably, the Raspberry Pi has become the most popular British computer ever made in its four years of existence. The title was formerly held by the Amstrad PCW which is believed to have sold a total of eight million units. \u201cThe two main things that people do with their Pi are use it as a PC replacement or use it as an embedded computer,\u201d Mr Upton told the BBC. \u201cThe Pi 3 is doubling down on both those things rather than going looking for new things to do.\u201d The gadget is also starting to be used widely in schools, and the Pi Foundation\u2019s merger with the Code Club initiative will make sure it reaches more children, says Upton. \u201cWith 9-11 year-olds, we are seeing a lot of people get excited about it at that level,\u201d he says. UK astronaut Tim Peake also took a Raspberry Pi to the International Space Station Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related). When he\u2019s not writing about the latest developments in the connected home, he\u2019s normally driving his little smart car round town. A passionate swimmer, Chris has his own swimming blog and is a qualified lifeguard.

VMost people just go along with whatever life hands them. No critical thought. For years I asked people, \u201cWhy do I need an iPhone?\u201d Haven\u2019t yet met the man nor woman who could give me a straight answer.\u000a\u000aImage: AP \u201cSeems like all these Apple products cost twice as much as the other stuff,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cWhat gives?\u201d All I got in reply was a wave of white noise. Something about viruses. People just want to fit into the crowd. Don\u2019t want to make waves. Whatever the popular girl in class has, everyone else needs to have it. So on and so forth. Next thing you know everybody I knew had an I phone except for me. Not having received any explanation as to why I too should have one, I refrained. If I wanted to be \u201cMister Popular\u201d I never would have chosen a career as a crusading journalist, so why should I worry about what brand of telephone every Tom, Dick and Harry has in his pants pocket? For years I paid $US55 ($72) a month for a Virgin Mobile phone and life was just fine. Then I suffered from the common ailment of GREED. Though I had what was sufficient, I wanted more. I wanted the shiny baubles that modern society produces as a bitter trade for the isolation of post-industrial life. I wanted to get reception on my phone in more places. I went and bought myself an iPhone. You would have thought that I had done something of moral worth. \u201cHey, I see you have the \u2018i message\u2019 now,\u201d my idiot friends would text me. The day I meet a man who can give me one good reason why it\u2019s better to have my text messages be in blue instead of green, I\u2019ll vote for that man for president. He doesn\u2019t exist, folks. I\u2019ve come to find out that I didn\u2019t just buy an iPhone; I bought myself a set of chains. The chains are shaped like an iPhone \u2014 and they bind me to a big, huge phone bill. In this case the phone bill is a metaphorical boulder, and I am chained to it. One hundred dollars a month for mobile phone service? Do I own this phone \u2014 or does the phone own me? Rather than buying an iPhone perhaps I should have spent more time dealing with the \u201cI\u201d that matters \u2014 me, inside. It makes phone calls. It sends text messages. It takes photos. It has the apps. It sure seems to me like this \u201cnew iPhone\u201d does exactly the same things that my old phone did. The biggest difference? I\u2019m paying $US45 ($59) a month more for it. That\u2019s more than $US500 ($652) a year. If I invested that money each year for the next 20 years at a modest five per cent rate of return I\u2019d have myself enough money to buy a new jet ski for me and one for my cousin, too. Instead, I have a phone that sends text messages in blue rather than green. Is an iPhone more fun than two jet skis? Don\u2019t answer that question \u2014 for your own sake. Life is hard and all the only things that are really important are peace, justice and love. The world is full of people who\u2019ve found that they can make a pretty penny exploiting the fundamental desire for love that we all have inside of us. Around every dark corner lurks a hustler or conniver ready to promise you that their pricey bauble will fill that hole inside of you. Seems like you can even build the world\u2019s biggest company that way. Full disclosure: I\u2019m not the first one to write a story about just how much an Apple can cost. That would be a couple by the name of Adam and Eve. They found out the hard way \u2014 and it seems that we\u2019re still learning the hard way today. I shall suffer for my GREED. I shall pay the high bill for years to come. But it will all be worth it if one person can learn from my mistake. You don\u2019t need an iPhone. It\u2019s just a phone that does basically the same stuff as every other mobile phone. Spend more time reading philosophy and less time worrying about what is or isn\u2019t in the latest telephone. In philosophy you can find some wisdom \u2014 and you just might find a little happiness, too. (It makes you sound smart and you can use this facade to attract a mate. Nobody wants to mate with someone known only for being \u201cthe iPhone kid.\u201d)  LIVE BLOG: Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 Launch, As It Happened \u000aAmazon Just Blew The Lid Off The iPhone 7\u000aApple Just Accidentally Tweeted The Latest iPhone\u000aEverything You Need To Know About The Apple Watch Series 2\u000aSuper Mario Is Coming To The iPhone\u000aThe Apple Watch Series 2 Is \u2018Swimproof\u2019\u000aThe iPhone 7 Is Here: Everything You Need To Know\u000aHere It Is: The New Apple iPhone 7\u000aHow The New iPhone Camera Will Make Your Photos Better\u000aApple\u2019s AirPods Are The Tiny Wireless Earbuds Of The Future\u000aEverything Apple Announced Today\u000aApple Is Finally (Slowly) Giving Up On 16GB Phones Oh god, where to start with this article?\u000aFirst up, I'm not an iPhone user. A lot of it does come down to personal preference. I have had iPhones previously but I found it started to be limiting, in what I could do, as opposed to a good Android phone. But I do think Apple make it good for noobs. People who don't have much of a clue, are protected by the Apple lockdown as such.\u000aiMessage isn't just blue/green. This just shows a lack of understanding of what it actually is. It sends messages over data, to other iPhone users. Now, it may not be that useful anymore, depending on plans having unlimited texts but when it originally came out, plans had limited texts. Good for getting around international text charges, if that's in your particular plan. Also has read notifications on it as well.\u000aPaying more? Sounds like you just plain went with a shit plan. I know people who have cheaper plans than others and I also know some who buy them outright.\u000aLastly, you state "You don't need an iPhone". If you're going to be that technical, you don't need any mobile, you will survive without one. I know the odd person who doesn't have a mobile at all. Congratulations, your post shows that you have absolutely no idea what the author is trying to say. It perfectly illustrates his point by giving vague non-reasons for using Android, just as his friends did for using iPhones. In fact, his entire point was that the decision was not a personal one, it was one born of herd mentality. Then you go further, suggesting iPhones are for people who are more stupid than you (although clearly their market is much larger than that). You couldn't be more patronising if you tried. I would also suggest that unlimited SMS predates the first iPhone available in Australia, possibly by many years. I certainly can't remember the last time I had to worry about an SMS costing me money. There is no way you can get a new iPhone as cheaply as dozens of other smartphones. You can see on this page, for example - https://www.telstra.com.au/mobile-phones/mobiles-on-a-plan#!/filter/brand//os//features//plan/s/sort/featured - that you can have a Lumia 640 for nothing or pay $49 a month for an iPhone 6 Plus. $49 x 24 months is the best part of $1200!!! For a phone!!!! Most people wouldn't pay that much for a laptop and they'd expect it to last four or five years. I bought a brand new phone outright for $169 last Decemeber, What brand new iPhone could I get for that? An ancient iPhone 4? Of course you need a phone, society relies far too heavily on it today. Again, the point is the vast majority of people would be just as happy on the $0 Lumia 640 because it can do everything they need a phone for - calls messages, apps, internet. In the early days you needed an iPhone, although Apple were a year or two late to both the 3G the 4G party, but these days even low end phones offer a great experience. This is a pointless article. You want philosophy... Just enjoy what you have mate. No need to rant on about people buying new toys.  Just be lucky you have the option to buy or not to buy. There are places in the world where people don't have that luxury. One of those places is where I am from. Just enjoy your first world life and don't judge. Some of us buy these gadgets for a reason and not always just for showing off. If showing off or copying friends is the reason why you buy things in the first place you need a hobby or new friends. Get off your first world perch! To be honest, I can't think of a regular need I have that isn't satisfied in the normal course of my life. As a culture, we have moved well beyond need and we are now living in the land of want. My house is filled with wanted things. Why I have the particular things I do is my choice. I find it amusing that each time Apple releases a new product, people come out with all the reasons why you shouldn't buy it. Some people like spending their money on going to sporting events, others like buying the latest gadgets. Good thing we are all adults and can buy what we want. The thing is, what you want is only what Apple told you to want. I dunno about this.  Pretty sure Maslov had the iPhone somewhere between Esteem and Self-actualisation.  And Maslov seemed to know his shit. *People don't need an iphone every year or 2 or even 3 years The smartphone has essentially been perfected, I think I will be using my Nexus 6 until it packs it in or gets destroyed by my daughter \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 3:16 pm								 Even then, you can do what I did and just buy another one the same. When my battery life started to annoy me, I had a look around and just couldn't find a phone I liked more than the one I had, so I just bought another one. news just in, water wet, pointless, meaningless rant, how is this tech news ? worst post ever ! For me personally, the only thing Apple has over Android is Facetime. Yes video chat is not new and there are tonnes of options. But for my aging parents who live in Africa with poor connection. Facetime seems to be the clearest / easiest option. Hangouts and skype arent crisp enough.  If not for Facetime, i would not go near an iPhone.  P.S my daily is an LG G4 and we use an old iPhone to communicate home. Your parents can't use Skype? Really? I'd have thought having a whole computer screen would be much better for them than staring into a tiny phone screen. Locally, my phone plans haven't differentiated between voice and video calls since before Facetime even existed. It seemed like the most useless feature when they announced it. I think what @paaj means is skype can't handle the connection, which in return gives a horrible use experience. I know it's like that when my father used skype to chat with his brother in Manila. I told him (the uncle) they should use Facetime since it just seemed to work so much better than Skype, which was always having issues. ^spot on mate. My dad still has his old nokia and freaks out when the keypad locks by mistake :) Ah, the false assumption that if you have a smartphone, you can't possibly spend any of your time doing something intellectual. You can have an iPhone and read philosophy at the same time. You can even read philosophy on your iPhone. Imagine that. There is not the slightest hint of that opinion in the article. The author suggests you read philosophy instead of worrying about what trends you may be missing out on. He acknowledges completely that we all need a smartphone and at no point does he suggest you should use your phone less. I did philosophy for three and a half years at uni. I suggest people don't do it. *Cringe* Turn on your irony detector app and read this again guys. I am completely used to copping this kind of reaction to sane, reasonable, objective discussion but I always figured it was down to my abrasive personality. For that reason I am very surprised at the reaction here to this article. My comment was originally going to be a "hallelujah" that Gizmodo printed something rational and objective for a change but the comment have elicited this response instead. Every point in this article is well reasoned, objective and backed by evidence. He even admits that he was weak or stupid enough to succumb himself, which means he is able to speak from a  perspective I cannot (although I have tinkered with the thought of buying an old iPhone, just for shits and giggles). It seems, though,  that people get extremely defensive when societal norms are challenged, even those they have little or nothing invested in. I find that very surprising and more than a bit scary (and sad). Instead of wading through pseudointellectual nonsense apparently written as a form of self therapy, I'll just buy whatever I want and enjoy it, thanks. My phone is principally a tool (I need a smartphone for work with specific apps - no app support on a platform and I can't use that platform, period) but I ultimately choose whatever device I find most comfortable to use. Right now that's an S7 Edge, before that it was an iPhone 6S. I don't need to go on a philosophical spirit quest to figure that out. Why did you write this article? Your audience is comprised of technology enthusiasts. They come here to hear about whats new in the tech world. This article is negative and depressing. I find it alienating. The About Gizmodo page says "Gizmodo loves technology". This article screams the opposite. Well, for one, when i got my iPhone 3G, I was escaping a Palm Treo with Windows Mobile on it. It was terrible. Getting music onto it was through SD card copies, (oh and had to be DRM free too - Thanks all-of-mp3.com) It crashed often, ran low on resources, had to micro manage running apps on it. So I sold it, and paid the extra to go to the iPhone 3G when it came to NZ. Guess what, My daughter still uses that phone today (as an MP3 Player). At the time Android was, well, still crap.  Then after 2 year, I upgraded to the iPhone 4, then after two years, the 5, then after two years, the 6.  Android is pretty good now, but honestly, I haven't upgraded my desktop mac mini since 2011, It still works great. My iPad 2 still works, My iPhones all still work and have been passed down the family tree. I really have no confidence the other phones will last the distance, or even get OS upgrades after 2 years. With most Droids, you really can't guarantee anything other than the (sometimes 2 year old) OS it ships with. So I guess like an iSheep, I'll upgrade again this year, my Wife want my iPhone 6, and My daughter will inherit her iPhone 5c now she is going to intermediate next year. Apple did add the feature I wanted most of al to the 7, better battery life. Just annoyed they dropped the 64GB model. 32GB is too small for anyone these days, but I haven't even filled my 64GB 6. Haven\u2019t yet met the man nor woman who could give me a straight answer. I suspect that you're not talking to the right people, but given that you refer to your friends as\u000amy idiot friends \u000aI think the main issue is that you're a dick. Whatever the popular girl in class has, everyone else needs to have it.Until she gets herpes. Well I need an iPhone. Just because it is cool and YOLO !

VIf you\u2019re living in a house out in the sticks that doesn\u2019t have fixed-line internet, or even a house in the city with a terrible ADSL connection \u2014 like me \u2014 then you have an alternative, provided your download quota requirements aren\u2019t too high. D-Link\u2019s DWR-921 is a router that you can plug a SIM into and have instant fast 4G access, as long as you\u2019re happy to pay Telstra or Optus or Vodafone for mobile data. The D-Link DWR-921 only has built-in 802.11n rather than the current, faster 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard that other D-Link home routers like the Viper and the Taipan do, but it\u2019s not the kind of device that you\u2019d hook a whole house worth of connections to. D-Link says it\u2019s the kind of stop-gap solution you\u2019d use if you didn\u2019t have access to higher-quota fixed-line services like ADSL or cable. It\u2019s a lot easier and faster for Australia\u2019s mobile telcos to build out fast, reliable 4G services than it is for those same telcos or their fixed-line competitors to roll cable and fibre down streets and highways. That was once one of the arguments against the NBN. But since mobile data limits are much smaller than we\u2019re used to on fixed-line services, it\u2019s not a perfect solution. The DWR-921 is $249.95, and you can find it at D-Link\u2019s resellers around Australia. [D-Link] I have a tin roof and get no internet/call reception inside.\u000aJust go on without me and let me die in peace. This modem has a facility for external LTE antennas - so you can easily put an antenna on a mast above your roof and use a cable connection to connect it to a router like this, and use WiFi to keep your devices connected to the internet. Sadly, that won't help with normal voice calls unless your phone supports WiFi calling...but you could potentially use Skype/Viber/Facetime to make calls instead. Aren't external LTE antennas illegal in Australia? My parents had one of the roof of their house for their old 3G connection which they bought directly from Telstra. No, LTE antennas are perfectly legal and are widely used in cars and buildings. Cell boosters of any kind are illegal, except one or two products specifically approved for Australian use. Cool thanks  :) Or use VOLTE. By definition, VoLTE means you need to have access to LTE, which is the very thing he's complaining about NOT having. So that doesn't help at all. Any 4g service have quota free Netflix yet? Optus\u000abut they explicitly  state its for the mobile device not tethering etc.. so I am guessing its only free for the CDN servers dedicated for mobile Campbell, will this work with vivid wireless? My parents live in far western Sydney. They have no access to ADSL and mobile phone reception is sketchy to say the least. Calls drop out and data speed dies when small planes fly overhead. One literally has to stick their head near a window to get any sort of coverage. :/ Or, you could get a Huawei E5573 from Officeworks for $25 with the same specs as this modem. D-Link must think people are fools. There are many better, and cheaper 4g modem options available - many that have been available for years. Not the same specs at all - they are designed for rather different applications. This device has a WAN port and 4 LAN ports to allow fall-back cut-over, better antennas for both LTE and WiFi for much better reception and broadcast range, and also has an integrated firewall. The E5573 is a fine device (and very cheap) if you want something portable, but it's unsuited to permanent home installations and can't handle wired connections at all. Also, that $25 price is carrier locked, so you don't have a choice of providers. I just set one of these up for the new coffee shop at my workplace (hospital). They do everything wirelessly - cloud-based POS using iPads/iPhones, Apple/Android/Win app for online ordering, wireless EFTPOS terminal etc. It works well over Telstra 4G and their whole system is very portable. They did require a device that supported a wired IP receipt printer, which is why I chose the DWR-921 over more basic options. If you used the DWR-921, presumably you're running all of your portable devices on WiFi via the router, rather than each device having a separate 4G SIM - this would be much cheaper, provided that your router has sufficient range to broadcast WiFi over the entire workplace. Yes, all internet access is via the single 4G service of the DWR-921. All other devices are connected to this with WiFi. The area isn't huge and their data requirements are not immense.

VYum cha is not only delicious, it\u2019s a lot of fun eat with friends and family. Still, the dining process can be confusing or intimidating for those who haven\u2019t tried it before. If you follow these basic ground rules, you\u2019ll look like a yum cha pro.\u000a Photo by Paul Joseph. Yum cha (or if you\u2019re in the US or UK, \u201cDim sum\u201d) is a type of Chinese cuisine where small portions of a wide variety of dishes are brought to the table on plates or in steamer baskets. So how does it all work? The whole meal is family style, where everyone has a little bit of everything. Chinese culinary expert Carolyn Phillips, author of The Dim Sum Field Guide, shares some of the most important ground rule with Food52: Also, only use your hands for foods like large buns, never leave chopsticks sticking out of your food, and signal you\u2019re full by placing your chopsticks on your plate parallel to you. You can learn more helpful information about yum cha etiquette at the link below. How to Dim Sum Like a Pro [Food52] I'm assuming the above is intended to cover dining with people you don't know well. We go for yum cha with friends regularly and don't bother with any of that pretentiousness. Want the last piece of something? Just take it, we can always grab some more.\u000aWant a dish all to yourself? Go ahead, we'll just grab another if others want it too. In fact the only "rule" we have is, if you take the last of the tea it's your job to get the pot refilled.

V\u2018Phablets\u2019 like the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, above, witnessed massive growth in 2015 After tracking 3.2 trillion sessions over the course of 2015, Yahoo-owned analytics company Flurry has revealed overall mobile app usage rose by 58% during the year with personalisation apps witnessing the biggest growth of 344%. Meanwhile phablets \u2013 large screen mobile phones with all the functionality of tablets \u2013 are set to become the dominant smart device in 2016, reckons Flurry. According to Flurry, the majority of mobile phone growth is from Emoji apps (mainly keyboards) giving consumers the ability to share customised correspondence via Whatsapp, Snapchat and others. See graphic below. Kim Kardashian\u2019s \u2018Kimoji\u2019 app skyrocketed to the no.1 spot in the app store on its launch.   Mobile phone use grew 58% in 2015 but the biggest growth areas were in the personalisation (emojis) and news/magazines sectors Furthermore, the report predicts that the time spent on phablets will continue to grow. Having increased by 334% year on year, (2.9 times more than the average), compared to 117% for all form factors, it will become the leading form factor by October 2016, and will replace small phones by 2017. Over one quarter (27%) of all new devices activated for Christmas this year were phablets and 50% of all Android devices activated in the same timeframe were phablets. The growth of news and magazine apps on phablets was almost five times that of all devices, much higher than the rate of the average smart device. Meanwhile productivity app sessions grew by 119% with teens and college students in particular using their smartphone and tablets to access apps such as Google Docs, Quip, Slack and the Microsoft productivity suite. News and Magazine apps grew too, up 141% in 2015. This growth signals a shift in media consumption from television and PCs to smartphones in general, and phablets in particular, While the overall growth rate of smart devices has declined (58% in 2015 compared to 76% in 2014 and 103% in 2013), it remains stunning as rates like these are rare in mature industries, reckons Flurry. What was even more impressive is the majority of that growth rate came from existing users versus new users. In fact, in 2015, Flurry estimates that 40% of the 58% total growth in sessions came from existing users, compared to 20% in 2014 and 10% in 2013. Time spent on phablets grew 334% year-over-year with time spent on mobile surpassing that spent watching television. You can read the full report here.    Phablets are expected to overtake smaller sized phones in popularity by the end of 2016, reckons Flurry.   .   Interesting data on form factors, thanks for sharing! It\u2019s actually surprising to see how fast \u201cphablets\u201d caught on. People have been really willing to adapt the almost tablet sized smartphones.

VComplementing the Active Heating System (centre) are the Hive Active Plug and Window/Door Sensors You probably know Hive best for the connected home system that enables you to take control of your heating and hot water remotely using your smartphone. It\u2019s been around for around three years now but is steadily improving with much more attractive Nest-like thermostats (pictured above) and more intuitive onscreen menus to provide greater control. Now the British Gas owned company is branching out further into home automation with several new products including the Hive Active Plug and the Hive Window or Door Sensor. These will be available to purchase online at hivehome.com from Wednesday 27th January. Each plug, for example, will cost just £39 although customers new to Hive will also need the Hive Hub at a cost of £80 (for existing Hive Active Heating customers the existing Hive Hub will work with all new products). Built on Hive\u2019s Honeycomb platform (well, what else would you call it!), The Hive Active Plug allows you to turn appliances on and off from wherever you are. Worried you\u2019ve left your hair straighteners or iron on after leaving the house? Simply check and switch them off from your phone. With the Hive Active Plug The Hive Active Plug also allows users to set a schedule, using up to six time slots a day, to switch electrical appliances on and off automatically \u2013 meaning you\u2019re not wasting electricity by keeping appliances such as lamps on when you don\u2019t need them. It\u2019s also good for security purposes as you can switch lights on and off whenever you want rather than a set time each day when you are away. Complementing the Hive Active Plug is are the Window and Door Sensors which helps customers monitor what\u2019s going on at home, even when they\u2019re not there. The wireless sensor is attached to a window, door frame, cupboard door or drawer, and will send an alert to your mobile, tablet or laptop via the Hive app if these are opened or closed. Each Hive Window or Door Sensor will cost just £29. For customers new to Hive the Hive Hub will also need to be purchased at £80. For existing Hive Active Heating customers the existing Hive Hub will work with all new products.Shipping will commence from week commencing 8thFebruary. The Hive Motion Sensors is a wireless passive infra-red (PIR) motion sensor that will detect motion in a space \u2013 specifically moving people. Users can be notified of moving people remotely via their mobile, tablet and laptop as the Hive Motion Sensor works seamlessly with the Hive home Hub and app. The Hive Motion Sensor will be available to purchase online from 9th February; shipping will commence from week commencing 22nd February. Each motion sensor will cost just £29. For customers new to Hive the Hive Hub will also need to be purchased at £80. For existing Hive Active Heating customers the existing Hive Hub will work with all new products. The new products come as Hive unveils new research revealing that the UK is in the grip of \u2018power paranoia,\u2019 with the process of checking and re-checking that appliances are switched with the average Brit wasting more than three minutes every morning checking their appliances. The research also found that electrical appliances aren\u2019t the only thing slowing us down and making us fret when we\u2019re trying to get out of the house on time. Concerns around basic home security measures afflict us too; one in 10 people have left the house without securely shutting the front door, 28% have left windows open and more than a third (38%) have mistakenly left lights on. Says Kassir Hussain, Director of Centrica Connected Home UK: \u201cWe all fit a phenomenal amount into our daily lives, not least in the mornings which can be one of the most hectic times of the day. Gadgets and appliances are intended to make our lives easier, so the fact they\u2019re slowing us down and afflicting us with niggling doubts is a problem.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve created the Hive Active Plug and the Hive Window or Door Sensor to fit seamlessly into people\u2019s lives \u2013 to give them new ways to control and monitor their homes, wherever they are. That\u2019s the job of connected home products: to restore people\u2019s peace of mind and provide reassurance when it\u2019s needed most.\u201d Launched in October 2013 there are now more than 250,000 households across the UK using the multi-award winning product. Only Hive Active Heating comes with installation included by a British Gas engineer. It\u2019s available to buy at hivehome.com, britishgas.co.uk, Amazon, John Lewis, Maplin, Very, Littlewoods, Argos, Apple stores and selected Currys/PC World stores. Hive Active Heating\u2122 is available to buy online at hivehome.com for £249, including professional installation from a British Gas engineer. There will be 10% off the price of all new connected homes products for existing Hive customers until the 31st March 2016 when they buy via www.hivehome.com or the Hive Hub.

VCloud accounting service provider Xero has developed a chatbox that lets its small business customers access information in their online accounting systems and automate tasks through Facebook Messenger. Here\u2019s what you have to know.  In April, Facebook released its chatbox API, which could be used to automate content and customise communication on Facebook Messenger. Looks like Xero is all on-board, unveiling its Hey Xero chatbot which will be released later this year. Powered by Amazon Web Services, the chatbot will let businesses access the Xero Advisor Directory through Facebook Messenger. They can send a message to Hey Xero\u2019s Facebook account to get recommends for suitable accountants or bookkeepers in their area. Xero subscribers can query their accounts information and perform automated account maintenance tasks through Hey Xero on Facebook Messenger. For example, customers can check their account balance and send invoice reminders by sending specific messages to Hey Xero. According to Facebook, more than one billion people around the world communicate on Messenger every month, and more than two-thirds of people expect to use messaging apps to talk to business. Pardon my scepticism, but the thought of letting any of my financial data anywhere near an application that comes from The Zuck fills me with horror and dread.

p786
VIn business the concept of happiness is likely to make some groan, roll their eyes or be dismissive. But increasingly we can\u2019t ignore the evidence that it helps business. Modern science is measuring the positive effects of happiness on the mind and body more effectively, so businesses are becoming more interested in how it can be achieved and help optimise what they do. Petrina Coventry is a Professor at the University of Adelaide In the age where creativity and innovation are required for a competitive edge, you need a workplace which encourages idea-generation along with a high rate of productivity and a healthy bottom line. Here\u2019s how happiness makes that happen. It broadens your focus and expands your thinking. The positive brain is 31% more productive than the brain in a negative, neutral or stressed state. As your mind opens up there\u2019s greater curiosity, free flow of ideas and productivity. Engagement is a measure of this. Surveys from the American management consulting company Gallup continue to find that only 13% of employees are actively engaged at work. In the US alone, this could mean a cost of up to US$550 billion in lost productivity annually. A 700-person study by economists at the University of Warwick found that happy employees were 20% above the control group in terms of productivity. The same study found unhappy workers were 10% less productive than the control. It shows individuals who are happier tend to: Having a great company culture that encourages happiness can generate better solutions and innovation that might not have come to light in a more oppressive environment. Two theories link culture and happiness: Maslow\u2019s needs theory and comparison theory. Maslow\u2019s needs theory says whether or not your needs are satisfied will determine if you will lead a good life. The more needs are satisfied, the happier people will be. It also dictates we are only motivated by a need, if lower level needs are met. Before you can be motivated to improve yourself, basic needs such as food, water, safety, belonging and esteem must be taken care of. Maslow\u2019s hierarchy can be easily used to show correlation between what needs are to be satisfied at an organisational level for an employee to grow. When a workplace is designed and managed to create meaning for its workers they tend to be healthier and happy. Comparison theory indicates that human happiness depends on comparisons between actual standards of quality of life and perceived life circumstances, called benchmarking. Using benchmarking we can see growing examples of organisations that are successful in meeting their employees needs, allowing employees to grow and self actualise. Examples of where employee growth is being realised can include creativity and pursuit of knowledge. That takes time and the ability to reflect. 3M adopted a program in 1948 that allowed employees to use work time to follow their passion and hatch ideas. The concept is called \u201c15 Percent Time\u201d. The scientist Art Fry invented the Post-It Note through the use of this program. More recently, Google introduced a program they call \u201cinnovation time off\u201d or 20% time, where they give the employees the opportunity to not \u201cwork\u201d for eight hours of their week to complete side projects that drive creative and innovative ideas for the company. This resulted in the creations of Gmail, Google Earth, and Google Talk. Hewlett-Packard Labs gives employees personal creative time during which new products have been created, such as clear bandages and optical films that reflect light. There is an exceptionally strong case to show that if you build a company culture to generate greater levels of happiness, purpose and engagement you will reap the rewards, employees can self actualise, innovate, and produce better results for the company. \u000a This article was originally published on The Conversation.

p788
VAstronomers have discovered a new asteroid \u2014 just in time to catch it as it hurtled past us at less than a tenth of the distance between us and the moon. It\u2019s the second time that\u2019s happened in two weeks. What have we done to anger you, space gods?\u000a Artist\u2019s conception of an asteroid breaking-up (Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech) This most recent asteroid, 2016 RB1, was both slightly smaller and slightly closer than 2016 QA2, the other undiscovered asteroid that brushed by us at the end of August. Still, their specs are pretty similar. 2016 RB1 measured in at somewhere between 25-15.24m and came by us at a distance of 40,234km yesterday. 2016 QA2 was around 80,467km away and measured over 15.24m. 2016 RB1 as seen by Italy\u2019s Virtual Telescope (Image: VT/Masi)\u000aDespite their close approaches, neither asteroid was actually on-course to hit Earth at all. Still, the fact that they are so close \u2014 and we had no idea until they were practically on our doorstep \u2014 is a little surprising. Part of it is due to the classic space problem: Space is very big and it\u2019s easy to miss things even when they are about to fly right through our orbit. The other problem is that it gets much harder to predict what asteroids are going to do once they get closer to us, because of a curious effect of nearing the sun on the paths of asteroids. Asteroids rotate and, as they come closer to the sun, the side closest starts to heat up. This built up heat can then push the asteroid miles into a different and sometimes hard-to-predict path. Tonight, NASA is going to be launching their first mission to capture some dirt from yet another near Earth asteroid, Bennu. But they also hope the trip will give them a chance to get a better idea of how these sun-powered pushes, called the Yarkovsky effect, work. If they\u2019re successful, we could get a whole lot better at predicting where nearby asteroids are going to go, before they\u2019re right next to us. Soo, based on the headline, it seems this asteroid has buzzed us twice in two weeks! That's one helluva fast asteroid! :-) "Still, the fact that they are so close \u2014 and we had no idea until they were practically on our doorstep \u2014 is a little surprising." Personally I don't think it's surprising at all that we aren't spotting 15m rocks from over 40000km away ... Thankyou, we can only see the big ones. Unfortunately its never a question of "possibly" when it comes to space rock, just a matter of "when and where". We are bombarded by the crap every minute of the day. The scary shit seems to be superluminal particles (tunguska event). Where did I see that description? If a proton hit the atmosphere at 1/20th LS it would ignite the atmosphere....

VIt\u2019s a strange phenomenon. There is no official trace of the iPhone 7 \u2014 the famous Apple line is that the company \u201cdoes not comment on rumours and speculation\u201d, even though its September 7 event is almost certainly to launch a brand new phone. But, even with no concrete evidence that the new iPhone will look a certain way, or be a certain shape, you can already buy a bunch of different iPhone 7 cases. Cygnett\u2019s website says it all \u2014 \u201cOUT NOW: brand new iPhone 7 cases!\u201d. A variety of different cases for two different, familiar phone sizes \u2014 the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus \u2014 are already on sale from the company that started out as a small Melbourne outfit in 2003 and that has now grown to cover the world. Screen protectors, folio flip covers, slim translucent cases in different finishes \u2014 you can put down your cash and have one shipped to your door right now.  In fact, it\u2019s a trend that has been going for the last few iPhone launches. As far as a few months out from D-day and H-hour, you\u2019ve been able to punch \u201ciPhone (X) case\u201d into Google and come away with a pretty fair idea of what the next Apple smartphone will look like. Some companies are briefed ahead of time as to what the phone will look like, plenty of others make educated and uneducated guesses. But, from what we\u2019ve seen, Cygnett\u2019s cases are pretty much right on the money. Would you buy a case for a phone that you haven\u2019t even seen yet, let alone learned all the features of? Or, y\u2019know, without learning the price of it? Whether or not that\u2019s a rational thing to do \u2014 whether or not buying a new phone in the first place is rational, even \u2014 the fact that you can buy a case for an as-yet nonexistent phone is pretty interesting.

SpaceX\u2019s blog post didn\u2019t provide much in the way of new information, and continued to stress that \u201cthe data indicates the anomaly originated around the upper stage liquid oxygen tank.\u201d According to the Los Angeles Times, SpaceX is within its legal rights to carry out the investigation itself, though the FAA will still be there to watch over things. This past June, following SpaceX\u2019s investigation into its failed rocket launch a year earlier, NASA\u2019s internal watchdog Paul Martin called out the federal agency\u2019s decision to allow SpaceX to lead the primary investigation, saying it raised \u201cquestions about inherent conflicts of interest.\u201d "Its other two launchpads in Florida and California weren\u2019t affected by the explosion" Well, that's a huge relief! I see no problem with the FAA not being the primary investigator. Planes and helicopters more there thing as opposed to rocket .

V\u000a\u000aSony quietly launched its latest Sony Xperia Z3+ yesterday. Here are 6 things you need to know about the new (and only slightly improved) flagship model: 1. The Xperia Z3+ has the same height and width dimensions as its predecessor (146mm x 72mm), but is thinner than the Z3 (6.9mm as opposed to 7.3mm). It also weighs less \u2013 144g rather than 152g 2. Design is a little sleeker while still remaining waterproof and dustproof. Sony has got rid of the magnetic charging pin and removed the flap over the USB port 3. Although the The Z3+ has the same 5.2-inch Full HD 1080p \u201ctriluminous\u201d display as the Z3, and the same 20.7MP rear camera, it\u2019s front-facing (selfie) camera has been upgraded from a 2.2MP sensor to 5MP sensor with a wider field of view 4. The 16GB internal storage option has been ditched and the Z3+ will now come with 32GB of built-in storage, while RAM remains at 3GB 5. Its biggest competitors are the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and the HTC One M9, which itself is a very minor upgrade to the 2014 edition 6. Rather confusingly the new model is called the Z4 in Japan but the Z3+ elsewhere   Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VSmartwatch sales have skyrocketed in the first six months of 2016 while smartphone sales remained flat, according to data from analyst firm Telsyte. Here are the details.  In the first half of 2016, smartwatch sales grew by 89 per cent compared to the same period of time in 2015. More than one million smart wearable devices were sold in the first half of 2016 and smartwatches now make up one-third of that category. Apple Watch is the number one smartwatch brand with more than 50% market share followed by Samsung Gear and Fitbit Blaze. According to Telsyte, the growth in smartwatches could be attributed to Australians focusing more on health and fitness (many are using brands like Fitbit and Garmin to track their exercise), price reduction coupled with greater availability through telco carriers, a wider variety of options and mobile contactless payment support for smartwatches. \u201cThe killer apps for early adopters of smartwatches seem to be fitness apps and mobile payments,\u201d Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi said. Meanwhile, Australian smartphone sales only went up by 3.8 per cent compared to last year, but that may be set to change with the impending release of the Apple iPhone 7. Are you on the smartwatch bandwagon? Were you one of the early adopters? Let us know in the comments. Apple Watch early adopter here; had my Apple Watch Sport as soon as it came out.\u000aLove it. I've been avoiding wearables for so long and I'm finally getting a Pebble. I'll report on how it goes... I'm curious to know why you decided to buy the Apple Watch early and what you like about it! :) I have a Pebble Time. I tried a few Android Wear watches too but the Pebble is better. I hope you write up a little article about it. Honestly, I just wanted one! I am firmly stuck in the Apple ecosystem for the moment, I wanted a wearable, and when Apple announced theirs I was sold. When they announced their pricing I baulked, but then I had  bit of a windfall so treated myself (to the cheapest option).\u000aAs for what I like about it: the cool charging, the convenience, the tracking, the future possibility of Apple Pay...\u000aSome thoughts:\u000ahttps://amomentworth.com/2016/04/21/thoughts-on-my-apple-watch/ Been using a Fitbit Blaze since release. Does exactly as I need, but do wish they would improve the device via software updates. Let's hope the second generation Blaze improves on tiny areas. Love my Apple Watch, but very disappointed by how easily the sport model scratches. I wear an original pebble for work and then a Garmin Fenix 3 the rest of the time. Personally, I think these do just enough for me without being a phone replacement on my wrist. More importantly, they don't require charging anywhere near as much as most other smartwatches and are actually waterproof, not resistant. I could never get a watch that's not fully swimming waterproof. I certainly don't think there is a smartwatch out there that matches the fitness capabilities of a dedicated fitness device from someone like Garmin, Suunto and Polar. I got a Samsung Gear S2 on day one, love it.  Its not a necessary device to have, but man its convenient.  Its the small things, like feeling a buzz when a message or notification comes through, and being able to just glance at the watch to know whether its something I need to handle or not, or just the pedometer being a couple of clicks away from seeing how I'm going for the day. Its a convenience though, and not a must have product, not by a long shot.  But I do know plenty of others that are eyeing off smartwatches of various levels this year, and almost without fail they are getting them for health reasons.  Tracking their exercise or steps or something like that, and combining it with the watch functionality.  So fitbits are popping up everywhere. ITs also a great conversation starter... Early adopter Moto 360. Soon upgrading to Huawei. They are by far the best looking of the smart watch group as of now though unsurprisingly most others are going the round face route. Good move, square is just not good looking. Early adopter Moto 360. Soon upgrading to Huawei.

VThough the 2014 Ouija movie was a big hit, it was bad and everyone expected a sequel to be crap. The release of the first trailer for Ouija: Origin of Evil changed that, delivering some truly terrifying and surprising visuals. The second trailer does more of the same by focusing on Doris, the possessed girl at the center of the film.\u000a She\u2019s played by young actress Lulu Wilson and, if Ouija lives up to these trailers, Doris is going to find herself on the same page as Carrie, Samara, and other young, creepy horror villains. Check it out:  Directed by Mike Flanagan, Ouija: Origin of Evil is actually a prequel to the first movie. It\u2019s a period piece set in 1964 about a mother (Twilight\u2018s Elizabeth Reaser) and her daughters who run a phony séance business. Then they get a new prop for the show: a Ouija board which takes a liking to one daughter in particular. [YouTube] Sorry all I'm seeing is *really* shitty CGI, sorry.

VThis weekend\u2019s New York Times op-ed about the ageism people over 50 face in the workplace includes a charming anecdote via JK Scheinberg, the esteemed Apple engineer who got Mac OS running on Intel processors.\u000a\u000aImage: Getty/Shutterstock \u000aA little restless after retiring in 2008, at 54, he figured he\u2019d be a great fit for a position at an Apple store Genius Bar, despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview. \u201cOn the way out, all three of the interviewers singled me out and said, \u2018We\u2019ll be in touch,'\u201d he said. \u201cI never heard back.\u201d\u000a Although Apple customers would have been lucky to have Scheinberg as their tech support, we can at least rest easy knowing the famed engineer wanted the job more as a hobby than as a way to earn money. The op-ed also called for age diversity in the workplace, pointing out that women face discrimination in the workplace starting at the tender age of 32, when they begin getting passed over for promotions, widening the pay gap. An information architect who got a job at a tech start-up at 55 described how alienating the age gap was between her and her coworkers. She quit after her boss told her, \u201cYou sound just like my mother\u201d during an argument. Age discrimination has much more sinister consequences, especially in the United States, where most of the elderly can\u2019t solely rely on social security for their income. In Australia, 23 per cent of people over 45 do not intend to retire before 70, often due to financial insecurity. How do we fix this problem? Throw away your prejudices and befriend the olds. [NYTimes via 9 to 5 Mac] Without playing devils advocate, there's a big difference in knowing the product back to front and having a skill set of empathy, customer service etc for a role. Personally, if I'm there seeing a tech boffin, I want someone who knows technical things and can solve problems.  Regarding sales pitches, if I'm there to buy something, I've already done the research and know what I want. Please. He was singled out at the group interview stage and not even given the common courtesy of a "sorry you have been unsuccessful" letter.  What it comes down to is the apple stores want a workers who look a particular way. A 54 year-old does not fit that look. He could have been Steve Jobs reincarnate. He doesn't look the part, he doesn't get the job. And yes it is discrimination. Apple tend to keep jobs open indefinitely and not necessarily close them. I'm still shortlisted for a role I applied for back in 2013, and the person doing the role at the moment is on indefinite "secondoment" If you think a "sorry you have been unsuccessful" letter is a COMMON courtesy, you probably haven't applied for many jobs recently. But yes, there's no doubt it's ageism. More generally, it's discrimination by appearance, which is rampant and very well documented, even between people within the same demographic category. Sorry you've been unsuccessful? Boy you're in for a shock if you look for a new role. The absolute best you can usually hope for these days is a "sorry, but we can't give feedback" a few months after the role is filled. Courtesy isn't common anymore. That's actually a good point. Ive been a developer for many years, and I have to say in my opinion (false) most of the developers Ive worked with would be terrible (me included) at customer relations. But, having said that, I still agree there is still a looming problem in modern society in the way we employ and value experienced older people compared to younger ones. Part of the issue is that older people value their experience more than can be warranted.\u000aIf you are expecting a pay rate in ilne with 25 years experience but the role can be filled at a junior level they you aren't going to get the job.\u000aThere is also a level of exploitation that you can get away with if people are new to the workforce, older folks are not going to put up with BS they went through 20 years ago x2 on this, the world is moving so damned quickly that "experience" can very quickly lose weight to the adaptability of younger people. 25 years of expertise can lose a lot of meaning when the up and comers grew up with the same kind of things so it's just second nature to them. For example, putting Microsoft Office experience on your resume, nobody cares, if you can't use office then you're not qualified, it's not a value add to your employer. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 2:57 pm								 Certainly agree that experience can "bloat" some peoples self worth.\u000aI always remember a saying I "read" which was quoted from Bruce Lee...\u000a"Beware of the artisan who boasts of 25 years experience, but has really only had one years experience, 25 times"\u000aCheers That is a great quote For technical service you would rather deal with someone who knows the technical side of the product. Leave the selling part to people who can sell with customer service and empathy.\u000aOnce my phone screen was faulty. Some Bimbo gave me attitude and insisted it was my fault cos to her it looked like it was due to physical damage. Sent my phone in for warranty repairs, lo and behold the screen was faulty. Get advice from a knowledgeable person. If they have great customer service than it's a bonus. The thing is it's a support script, followed by either a paid repair or a free repair/replacement care of that same customer service / selling role you aren't valuing. This is why Apples genius bars keep customers coming back, not because they fix things, because of the customer service. Which is an interesting point, except that they didn't get to a stage that would test him for those skills.  They decided purely on his age and appearance. The reality is that people gain experience with time, and the old folks know how to keep the trains running on time.  MBAs with quick profit mentalities are too stupid to realise this. Little news flash. Retirement age in Australia is already at 67 and I would wild guess by the time my kids retire it will be at 70. Yes age discimination is real and the government better start doing something about it. He must have left the "1987 - 2008 'Apple software design engineer" out of his resume. Either that or they didn't even bother looking at it, which is probably more likely. Didnt he know you have to be a fedora wearing hipster who lives at starbucks to be able to work at an apple store? Silly fella What like Indiana Jones? Or are you referring to a trilby hat? With my experience at the Perth Apple store, you don't need to be a hipster, just dumb as shit.\u000aI've not been to the Apple Store for my own needs, maybe since it opened but have been for family members who ask me to come along.\u000aI've actually had a genius who could not tell me how to change the resolution (I know how to). They were called over cause the sales person didn't know. I didn't try to humiliate them or anything. That was the worst one. Ugh.

VI have nothing against store-bought ice cream cones, but I don\u2019t keep them stocked at all times. This has prevented me from enjoying a cone on a whim, but no longer, as ChefSteps has shown me how to make them using plain ol\u2019 sandwich bread. \u000aPhoto by ChefSteps. To make these, you will need: bread, two baking sheets, parchment paper, and a cone roller (which you can either make out of a piece of still plastic or purchase for less than six bucks). First, trim the crusts off the bread and feed them to some ducks or something. Roll the trimmed bread slices out super thin, cut them into discs, and brush them with melted butter. Sprinkle them with a little sugar, maybe some cinnamon, or anything else that sound like it would compliment your cone. (Make sure you get both sides.) Next, grab two baking pans, and flip one over so it\u2019s facing down. Place a sheet of parchment paper on top, lay your buttery bread disks on top of that, place another piece or parchment on top of those, top the whole thing with another baking sheet, and bake them for six minutes at 163° C. Remove from the oven and \u2014 using the parchment so you don\u2019t burn your fingers \u2014 wrap the bread disks around a cone roller and let them harden for about half a minute. Let cool, fill with ice cream, devour, then click the link below to learn how to make cones out of frozen puff pastry.

p814
VSamsung\u2019s Gear S3 is a small evolution from the Gear S2 announced exactly one year ago. The software is very similar, and the processing hardware hidden away inside the watch\u2019s casing is nearly identical as well. But small evolutions can still be significant, and the Gear S3 is the first Samsung smartwatch that I\u2019d consider wearing for more than a couple of weeks at a time. The reason for that is that, by putting some thought into building a timepiece that looks more like a watch than it does a smartwatch, Samsung has made the Gear S3 look normal. It\u2019s the same X-factor that makes the Tag Heuer Connected outshine most of its Android Wear brethren \u2014 the Gear S3, in both its slightly understated and conservative Classic and more rugged Frontier variants, looks like a watch that you\u2019d see normal people wear. And that\u2019s a good thing. On the wrist, the Gear S3 definitely feels bigger \u2014 but not much bulkier \u2014 than the comparatively sleek Gear S2. It\u2019s a wider casing with a slightly larger screen \u2014 1.3 inches versus 1.2 inches, or 33mm versus 30mm \u2014 that suits larger wrists more than the old model. The steel that the Gear S3 is hewn from is probably its biggest advantage over the S2, because it doesn\u2019t feel like a toy any more. Like the Huawei Watch that has lived on my wrist since I got it, the face of the S3 looks adult and feels adult. The two variants of the Gear S3 suit different tastes; I definitely like the Frontier more, with its chunkier and darker bezel with more obvious serrations, but the Classic is probably more palatable if you wear a suit to work every day. The Frontier has a sweatproof rubber strap that integrates more smoothly into the lugs, the Classic is leather. Both have precisely the same feature-set \u2014 there\u2019s a 4G-enabled variant of the Frontier, but that won\u2019t be coming to Australia \u2014 so the difference only comes down to taste. When it does launch in Australia, before Christmas with a price tag as yet unconfirmed but likely within the Gear S2\u2019s $499 range, the Gear S3 is going to have some tough competition. Maybe a new Apple Watch, maybe a new Huawei Watch, but also the fleet of fitness-trackers-with-watches like the Fitbit Charge 2. While its Tizen OS isn\u2019t some peoples\u2019 cup of tea \u2014 especially if you\u2019re not already a Samsung smartphone user \u2014 the design more than stands up to competitors. The spec sheets of the Gear S2 and Gear S3, viewed alongside each other, are largely identical. The same 1.0GHz dual-core processor, 4GB of onboard storage, 768MB of RAM in the S3 versus the S2; all these are adequate specs for building a smartwatch that runs smoothly and looks pretty with its Tizen operating system as the Gear S3 does. The watch\u2019s 1.3-inch face, though, is around 20 per cent brighter, and that makes a significant difference to viewability in bright areas and to the persistence of Samsung\u2019s always-on watchfaces. While the watchface is bigger and better, it\u2019s also much more resistant to damage than the S2\u2019s Gorilla Glass 3 slice. Corning\u2019s new Gorilla Glass SR+ is smash resistant and scratch resistant, and should provide a genuine alternative to the sapphire glass used in other high-end smartwatches like the Huawei. The glass itself is also now slightly recessed behind a chunkier steel bezel, which should also protect it from accidental bumps. Built-in GPS is probably the most useful in a list of small, subtle inclusions in the Gear S3\u2019s hardware stack. That means you\u2019ll be able to take the S3 for a run and have it track your metrics with a little bit more finesse than just step tracking and heart rate monitoring, and it goes 90 per cent of the way to a proper fitness tracker \u2014 probably the 90 per cent that almost all buyers will be more than adequately served by.  Samsung Pay, though, is probably the most flashy addition. It\u2019s a useful one, too \u2014 combined with the GPS, it\u2019s not hard to imagine leaving your phone and wallet at home while you\u2019re out for a run or a bike ride, but still being able to pick up a coffee en route by tapping your watch against a NFC credit card reader. The Gear S3 also has MST \u2014 magnetic stripe emulation \u2014 but I can\u2019t think of the last time I swiped a card so it\u2019s an inconsequential inclusion for Aussies. Beyond that, the watch\u2019s software is the same generally good experience as the Gear S2. Tizen is clean, is built to run equally well on bezel clicks as it is on swipes and taps, and doesn\u2019t get in the way of actually telling time and reading notifications for the most part. If you throw away all the widgets and only add back the ones you want, it\u2019s a good experience. We\u2019ll have more time to pass judgment on the Gear S3\u2019s software in the coming days. Gizmodo travelled to IFA 2016 as a guest of Samsung. While its Tizen OS isn\u2019t some peoples\u2019 cup of tea \u2014 especially if you\u2019re not already a Samsung smartphone user I thought their tizen watches were compatible with all Android phones? The S2 series is, however you apparently miss out on some functionality... I guess S Health etc The Gear software is needed for it to sync notifications and updates. And that's limited to samsung phones. The GPS and NFC features in the S2 aren't all that flash anyway (Gear S2 in korea has a sim-card model with GPS and mobile-data access when not in bluetooth or wifi range.), as you need the tizen apps built for the korean or US/UK market, which australia doesn't get access to.  Unfortunately. What's available works. It's just not as feature packed as the korean marketplace. I've had my S2 Classic for ~9 months, using a black/chrome ceramic watch band off ebay for $40. looks just like their revamped S2 with the ceramic, South korea also has a pink gold model, and it's about $200 cheaper there.  The watch OS and Software works, but it's not great. Apps are limited, you can only get a handful of non-regional apps, i.e. NFC and QI codes work with asian/european airline apps, the downside is that while the Gear S3 has improved NFC (as long as the app support is there for AU apps), it means little until the app can support it. It's very tied into the gear marketplace for apps, as well as watchfaces. some of the better faces are free, anything that has a classic analogue face usually works very neatly on the black surface under the panel. And the "lite" / "full" faces are usually between garish, mediocre or classy, i.e. want a citizen or tag heuer lookalike ? easy. Snoopy ? there's 6 different ones. if i wanted a larger model, i'd get the Huawei W1 which has Android support and headset support, i.e. have a conversation over your phone using the watch microphone and speaker, dick tracy style, again, cheaper in some places than the Gear S2 or S3 in Australia. It is disappointing to read in the article that the 4G/LTE-enabled variant of the Frontier won\u2019t be coming to Australia.  Did you get this from a reliable source?  I sincerely hope you are wrong.  It is the same disappointment we had with the S2 when Samsung launched the 4G variant in the US and some countries in Asia but not Australia.  Isn't there anything we can do as consumers to voice our disappointment?  I personally know few blokes who didn't buy S2 hoping they will be able to buy the LTE variant of the S3 with a local warranty. My source is Samsung, yup. Australia's telcos aren't ready to support its virtual SIM. Vodafone will have eSIM support in early 2017, and Telstra should be soon after. That's when we'll start seeing these kind of gadgets appearing, if the telcos think they can sell enough of them to justify the order. THIS SUCKS!!!... So this means I'm going to have to wait another 12 months before I can get a smart watch that wont have to be tethered to my phone.....  Why is Australia always stuck in a technology backwater? Original Gear S I own - no need to tether to phone. Always have the sim in watch now. Phone is a camera now that I sometimes take with me. Pity, I've been looking for a Smartwatch, and pretty much the only thing holding me back now is 4G support. Looks like I'll be waiting until next year. It has a NANO SIM, not sure why my nano sim wont work in the 4G? I don't know if this is off topic but I *love* the super cheap Chinese phones from Gearbest, Everbuying,etc.\u000aTwo months ago I got an Aiwatch G3 for $60 and put a microSIM in it and can call directly from my wrist (it has surprisingly loud speaker). It is only 2G so late this year it will only be useful as smartwatch linked to my phone via bluetooth, which is why I'm researching my next 3G enabled smartwatch which currently cost about $180.\u000aSo, the S3 sounds great, but given the price and the speed of improvements I'm happy to take a chance on some lesser known smartwatches. \u000a									Last edited September 4, 2016 4:58 pm								 I was going to make a comment about price. $500 seems pretty steep considering it will probably only last 2-3 years before the battery gets too bad. I get it's a lot of technology in a small package but it seems more gimmicky than functional and I can't justify that cost for myself! \u000a									Last edited September 10, 2016 5:30 pm								 Original Gear S I own - no need to tether to phone.

VThe hour is almost upon us. In the early hours of Thursday morning, the world will \u2014 almost certainly \u2014 be introduced to Apple\u2019s new and improved iPhone 7. What will it look like? What magical feature will it possess? Just how many cameras will it have? Only time will tell. That time, by the way, is 3AM. Set your alarms. 7:00PM: How are we all doing tonight, guys and girls? All stocked up on Red Bull? I know I sure am. Shout outs to anyone keen or crazy enough to wake up with me. Early Thursday morning, maybe around 2:30AM, I\u2019ll be back here and blogging away with Gizmodo journalist Rae Johnston to bring you the good word direct from Cupertino. Now, what do we expect to see tomorrow? The iPhone 7 is the obvious one. Really, if we don\u2019t see an iPhone 7, I think I might just have to eat my hat. But beyond the iPhone 7, there\u2019s a chance we could see an ancillary device or devices announced too. Does that mean a new iteration of the Apple Watch? It\u2019s entirely possible. If you want to watch Apple\u2019s live-stream of the iPhone 7 event, here\u2019s the place to find out how. You\u2019ll either need a Mac, iOS device or Apple TV, or a Windows 10 PC with the Microsoft Edge browser. Got any ideas as to what we might be seeing? Feel free to jump in the comments and share your thoughts and hopes and dreams. In case you missed it, here\u2019s the beautiful invitation that Apple sent out to invite the world to Thursday morning\u2019s event: 2:15AM: Morning folks! Who\u2019s awake? I sure am. Jet lag from a week of IFA in Berlin and writing about the Galaxy Note7 recall in the wrong time zone will do that to you.  Apple\u2019s September Special Event page has been updated with a little reminder that the live video stream will kick off at 10AM PDT, or 3AM our time. Only 45 minutes to go\u2026 Now, to keep up with the live blog, remember to refresh the page regularly to get yourself the latest news. Think of it like watching the F1 on your TV, but also listening to the BBC\u2019s commentary on your phone at the same time: it\u2019s awesome, but you gotta put in that little bit of extra effort. 2:30AM: Hey, look at that! Amazon has a bunch of beautiful iPhone 7 cases for you to order. A bunch of nice cases from Aussie guys Cygnett came out yesterday, even. You know one thing that\u2019s a lot better about the iPhone launch every September, compared to the March event or WWDC in June? The temperature in Australia. Seriously, I\u2019m sitting here in boxers, where WWDC had me huddled in front of a heater with about six layers still freezing my fingers off. This is balmy. 2:45AM: So, let\u2019s pass the time by taking a quick look at some of those cases off Amazon for clues to see how accurate they might be. We\u2019ll know in the next couple of hours for sure, but that dual rear camera is there, at least on the larger 7 Plus. The home button is still visible too, although in these renders it\u2019s impossible to tell whether it\u2019s a Force Touch haptic-feedback one or a clicky tactile one. 2:50AM: 10 minutes out of the launch and we have a live video feed! With some great tunes courtesy of Apple\u2019s baller Beats 1 radio station on Apple Music, and some beautiful panning shots of a the crowd. Refresh your page if you can\u2019t see it. Here\u2019s where to go to watch it, by the way\u2026  3:00AM: It\u2019s time. Apple\u2019s Tim Cook takes the stage\u2026 but first we\u2019re treated to a James Corden Carpool Karaoke, with Tim Cook and Corden singing along to a bit of OneRepublic. And Pharrell is here too! Tim Cook walks onto stage to rapturous applause. Quick plug for Carpool Karaoke coming to Apple Music in the near future.  We\u2019re now getting some quick updates on Apple products. First up is Apple Music, which now has 17 million subscribers, and 30 million songs. A bit of love for the iTunes Festival, too, which is now in its 10th year. Wow. Apple\u2019s App Store has had 140 billion downloads. The iPhone and iPad are the most popular gaming devices in the world, and there are half a million games available for download. 3:10AM: Whoa. Nintendo games coming to the iOS App Store. A brand new game called Super Mario Run is being introduced by Nintendo\u2019s Shigeru Miyamoto on stage. The game is going to be the first Super Mario title that you can play one-handed. As well as traditional Mario play, there\u2019s also a two-player battle mode called Toad Rally where you can pit yourself against your friends\u2019 high scores. It actually looks really fun! And I can\u2019t wait to give it a go. Nintendo is releasing a bunch of stickers for iMessage, too, when iOS 10 launches (whenever that is, hint hint). Apple\u2019s Tim Cook is now back up on stage, giving an update on the company\u2019s ConnectED education program. Apple supports 114 schools around the US by giving Macs and iPads to teachers, and iPads to kids. 3:20AM: We\u2019re now getting a bit of love for Apple\u2019s iWork platform \u2014 Pages, Keynote and Numbers, which work across iOS and MacOS. Apple is bringing real-time collaboration to the platform, and is showing it off by editing the actual Apple presentation live on stage, with a bunch of different people building a slide in real time in front of the audience. 3:25AM: Cook: \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about new products\u2026 beginning with Apple Watch.\u201d Apple has become the second-placed watchmaker in the market, after Rolex, since the original Apple Watch launch. Apple\u2019s Jeff Williams is on stage to talk about the new Apple Watch. We\u2019re getting a run through of everything that\u2019s new in WatchOS 3, which was announced and previewed back at WWDC in June. Pokemon Go is coming to the Apple Watch! Niantic\u2019s CEO is on stage talking about the app: it\u2019s been downloaded over 500 million times around the world, and trainers have walked more than 4.6 billion kilometres playing the game. \u201cSomething new we\u2019ve been working on\u201d from Niantic \u2014 that\u2019s Pokemon Go on the Apple Watch \u2014 uses a complication on the Apple Watch watchface to show how far it\u2019ll take to hatch any eggs that you\u2019re incubating, with a haptic feedback tap when PokeStops are nearby and a swipe from the watch to pick up items. You can\u2019t catch Pokemon, though \u2014 you\u2019ll need to take out your phone for that. 3:35AM: Pokemon Go for Apple Watch will be out before the end of the year. Jeff Williams is back on stage talking about Watch again more generally. \u201cWe are going to keep pushing Watch forward\u201d, says Williams\u2026 with the launch of the next generation of Apple Watch. Apple Watch Series 2 is swim-proof where the original was splash-proof, water resistant to 50 metres. It uses a redesigned speaker system to eject any water built up inside the watch \u2014 that\u2019s incredibly cool. Apple Watch Series 2 has a dual-core processor that\u2019s 50 per cent faster and a graphics chip that\u2019s twice as powerful \u2014 making apps like Night Sky work at faster frame rates and with more detail. As well as the brightest display ever on any Apple product, with 1000 nits maximum brightness, the Apple Watch Series 2 has built-in GPS for phone-free workouts with accurate fitness tracking and measurement. That\u2019s awesome. There\u2019s even a hiking app for Apple Watch Series 2, from Viewranger. This is something I would seriously use. I\u2019m stoked for the new Apple Watch. 3:45AM: Apple Watch Series 2 comes in a new ceramic finish as well as the usual variants, and comes with the same beautiful leather and elastomer and woven wrist bands. There\u2019s also a brand new partnership with Nike, for the Apple Watch Nike Plus, built specifically with runners in mind. Nike says the new device is simpler than any other fitness or running watch \u2014 hey, didn\u2019t Nike make those in the past? The watch uses software hooks, too, like an Are We Running Today reminder, and a reminder that Sunday is the day that runners like best (it\u2019s true!). Buying an Apple Watch Nike Plus also gets you membership into the Nike Plus running club. Huh! That\u2019s interesting. New Apple Watches will be available a couple of weeks into September, with even the original getting a processing hardware update and lower $US269 starting price. Watch Series 2 comes in at $US369, same with the Nike Plus version. 3:54AM: It\u2019s iPhone time! Apple has sold over a billion iPhones. We\u2019re getting a bit of an update on what\u2019s new in iOS 10\u2026 Now getting a bit of a run through on everything that\u2019s new with Apple\u2019s smart home HomeKit service and Home app, and Messages. \u201cBut the world\u2019s most advanced operating system deserves the world\u2019s most advanced smartphone\u2026 and here it is.\u201d Apple\u2019s Jony Ive (drink!) gets a voice-over talking through the new device, the most beautiful that Apple has ever built. A whole bunch of engineering genius \u2014 everything from polishing to machining to dye and \u201cion particle bath\u201d to create the new Jet Black piano black finish. Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller is up on stage to talk the iPhone 7. We\u2019re getting a run through of the 10 most important things about iPhone. The design. \u201cThere\u2019s a second black. We call it\u2026 simply\u2026 black.\u201d Laughter and applause. The home button is getting the same Force Touch makeover that the Apple MacBook had, with the company\u2019s multi-vibration Taptic Engine. The new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are water and dust resistant. IP67 is the standard Apple has built it to. The camera. The iPhone 7 (smaller) now gets optical image stabilisation and a faster f/1.8 lens, as well as a redesigned 12-megapixel sensor and a True Tone flash with four LEDs and 50 per cent more light output. The image signal processor, too, is more powerful than ever. The front camera is now 7 megapixels, up from 5 in the old iPhone 6s. It has the same wide colour support as the rear camera. That rear camera is \u201cthe best camera in any iPhone.\u201d 4:10AM: And now, the iPhone 7 Plus. Two lenses, two cameras. One 28mm wide-angle lens, one 56mm telephoto lens. Because that telephoto lens is double the wide angle, you can zoom between the two optically, with the same digital zoom (up to 10x) that has been on older iPhones. Apple is also using the two-camera setup for background defocus that it calls Depth Effect, using the array to determine the depth of field and blur backgrounds smoothly \u2014 \u201cit feels almost 3D, like the person is popping off the screen\u201d. This picture \u2014 beautifully smooth background, great detail \u2014 was taken on an iPhone 7 Plus. The software feature comes as an update after the phone\u2019s launch, apparently. Apple\u2019s Retina displays are getting another makeover. 25 per cent brighter \u2014 cool \u2014 and support for wide colour gamut \u2014 awesome! \u2014 and the same 3D Touch that we loved in the iPhone 6s. Instagram\u2019s guys are up on stage talking about how the new iPhone 7 works with Instagram Stories, integrating that optical zoom feature, and using Live Photos to create looping-GIF Boomerangs as well. Now we\u2019re talking about audio. The speakers inside iPhone 7 are \u2014 for the first time \u2014 stereo, with one at the bottom and one at the top, with twice the volume and a meatier dynamic range than the older phones\u2019. And new Apple EarPods. With the Lightning connector. Included in the box. And an adapter, Lightning to 3.5mm, will be in the box as well. Why is that? Oh, there\u2019s no headphone jack. Apple is giving its reason for getting rid of the 3.5mm headphone jack. That reason is courage. Seriously?! We\u2019re getting a spiel about how wireless is the future, and how cables are an annoying tether \u2014 but we have to deal with them for now. Until you get Apple\u2019s AirPod wireless earbuds, which promise 5 hours of battery life per charge, with a battery storage case that has another 24. They\u2019ll connect to your phone and Apple Watch as soon as you open the case, and \u201cthere\u2019s no step two\u201d. 4:35AM: Say what you want about the iPhone 7 not being revolutionary, but I think this is the biggest thing that Apple has ever done for music listening. AirPods are going to be massive. There\u2019s new Beats \u2018phones too, but we can get to them later. Now we\u2019re talking Apple Pay. The iPhone now has support for the FeLiCa NFC chip. And that\u2019s it! Performance. The new Apple A10 Fusion chipset is a 64-bit quad-core with two big and two little cores \u2014 an existing ARM architecture that Android has used for a while. The A10 Fusion is 50 per cent faster than the A9 in the graphics department, and 240 times faster than the original iPhone. Apple says the iPhone 7\u2019s A10 Fusion chip is\u2026 We\u2019re getting the usual run through on the amazing graphics that couldn\u2019t ever be achieved before, now available on the iPhone 7. This happens every year. The games even look the same. I couldn\u2019t tell you what\u2019s new or different.  \u201cWe can render over 400 monkeys at a flawless, flawless frame rate\u2026\u201d That happened. The longest battery life ever on an iPhone! 2 hours more than an iPhone 6s for the 7, and an hour more than the 6s Plus on the 7 Plus. God, this looks nice. Sign me up, guys \u2014 I\u2019ll take an iPhone 7 Plus in the flat Black finish. Cheque\u2019s in the mail. What will it cost? The same as the iPhone 6s that it replaces \u2014 $US649 in the States, $US769 for the 7 Plus. Aussie price coming soon. Double storage capacities for every model \u2014 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. The shiny Jet Black variant is only available in 128GB and 256GB. Pre-orders start on the 9th, with phones shipping on the 16th \u2014 including in Australia.  The new AirPods will be $US159, out in late October. 4:50AM: Tim Cook is back up on stage, giving us a run through everything we\u2019ve seen so far.  Aussies represent! Sia is up on stage performing her new single. And the iPhone 7 web page is live on Apple\u2019s site. Thanks so much for tuning in. We\u2019ll share the video replay extremely soon, and you can learn all about the iPhone 7, the Apple Watch Series 2, and AirPods if you take a look at our home page.

VWhen you\u2019re negotiating, needs can kill your position. If you absolutely need something, the other party can use that to drive a harder bargain. Try to leave as many needs at the door as possible to negotiate better.\u000a Photo by Alan Kotok. While it\u2019s true that you can\u2019t get around some needs, personal finance site Free to Pursue explains that when we think of certain needs as \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be nice\u201d things, we have an easier time walking away. In fact, we often think of some optional things as \u201cneeds\u201d when they\u2019re really not. That mindset makes it harder to say no. And if you can\u2019t say no, you can\u2019t effectively negotiate: \u000aWhen we move every potential acquisition to the \u201cit would be nice\u201d, it means we know we have the power to walk away from a negotiation at any point. When we\u2019re negotiating for a \u201cit would be nice\u201d item, we\u2019re tapping into logic and keeping most emotions \u2014 those things that make us act in goofy and unpredictable ways \u2014 at bay. It turns us from suckers to deal makers because we become more patient, self-assured and less likely to look for the quick fix.\u000a For example, if you\u2019re out car shopping, you might think you \u201cneed\u201d the extra trunk space. You do have kids after all. However, by thinking of that need as a \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be nice,\u201d you have more power to walk away. While this may not work for everything \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say no to a job offer if you\u2019ve been looking for six months \u2014 there are usually a lot of areas where our \u201cneeds\u201d are really things we can walk away from. And that makes them easier to negotiate.

VB&O\u2019s new app comes with a room builder that lets you customise floor plans and shapes Bang & Olufsen has launched an app that allows you to see exactly what products will look like once they are placed in your home. Called the BeoHome Design App, it can, for example, be used to see how the all-in-one wireless music system, BeoSound 35, or the BeoLab 90 will look.  The app lets you digitally visualise the different Bang & Olufsen products in any given space. You can choose between all the different speakers, sound systems and televisions and place them wherever the camera on your iPad is pointing.   You can easily change colours on the speaker fronts, shift brackets and stands on the televisions and do all the customisations needed to get exactly what fits your home. A key feature includes the \u201cRoom Builder\u201d where you can select, and customise predefined floor plans and shapes, and subsequently add products and furniture.  This provides a clearer idea on what to expect when adding Bang & Olufsen products to a room \u2013 especially because the feature also lets you add and move furniture around via augmented reality. This signals Bang & Olufsen moving into the augmented reality space to deliver optimum customer experience.

p824
VIt\u2019s a glorious day to be a Shapes fan. After having its reputation verbally machine-gunned into tatters, Arnott\u2019s has quietly dusted itself off and returned the original Pizza Shapes back to supermarket shelves. That\u2019s right ladies and gents: the Pizza Shapes you loved and lost are back from the dead.  Forget the iPhone 7 and PlayStation 4 Pro \u2014 today\u2019s most important news headline is the return of the original Pizza Shape. For the uninitiated, Arnott\u2019s controversially replaced the original Pizza Shape recipe with a new formula back in April. The response from consumers was almost universally negative. (You can read out own thoughts/rage-induced apoplexy here.) To put it incredibly mildly, the \u201cnew and improved\u201d version wasn\u2019t very good. One Twitter user memorably likened the texture and flavour to live ants. Thankfully, the biscuit boffins at Arnott\u2019s have finally seen sense. Pizza Shapes are making a triumphant return from the ashes. \u201cIn response to popular demand, Australia\u2019s beloved Original Pizza Shapes will return to supermarket shelves this September,\u201d the company explained in a statement.  \u201cSince the launch of the New Shapes flavours, we\u2019ve been listening to feedback. Aussies have clearly shown us the love they have for Original Pizza Shapes and we\u2019re happy to announce the product will be returning to shelves over the coming weeks. We\u2019ve been humbled by Australia\u2019s passion for Shapes and would like to thank our fans for their patience.\u201d According to Arnott\u2019s own sale data, Pizza is the third most popular Shapes flavour after Barbecue and Chicken Crimpy. We imagine this took a bit of beating since the flavour swap, which helps to explains the hasty about-face. Whatever. We\u2019re just happy to have Pizza Shapes back in our lives. Apparently, the vile new version will continue to be sold alongside the vastly superior original \u2014 so pay close attention to the packaging! Similar to Original BBQ, the only Pizza Shapes worth eating will have a distinctive black stripe on the edge of the box, like so: It's probably going to be like the Original Flavour BBQ shapes. My local supermarkets don't stock them, they only have the cloying tomato and sugar "improved version". And that means I'm going to be stuck with the Molasses and Vomit pizza flavour until the use-by date on the "Improved" taste shapes is passed. Be nice if we could get back cheese and bacon in it's original form too... tried the new ones... absolutely foul. Shame. Good news with pizza back though. Does anyone know somewhere that actually sells the "Original Flavour" varieties? Coles and Woolies. Be warned that "original flavour" means "we will use the original flavourings", NOT that the crisp will be just like it used to be. We Chicken Crimpy fans have been subjected to a more chemical-tasting, differently-textured crisp since the changeover.  I used to eat a couple boxes a week.  I bought one box of the new ones, ate about a third of it, sat it on my desk, and then a couple weeks later, tossed it out because I hadn't it touched since then.  I haven't bought any of the new formula ones since.  Oh well, it has removed some joy from my life, but at least it's saving me a few kilojoules.

VWindows/Mac: Installing and setting up a vanilla version of the Raspberry Pi\u2019s main operating system, Raspbian, is easy enough. If you want to do more with it, like set up custom software to run on boot, or connect to a Wi-Fi network, it\u2019s a bit of a pain. PiBakery simplifies all that dramatically.\u000a\u000aPiBakery basically allows you to customise your Raspbian installation before you even boot it up. This way, you don\u2019t have to go in and manually add scripts, edit settings or download software every time you create a new SD card. On a basic level, the most obvious use of this is to set up Wi-Fi credentials ahead of time, but you can also install common software like a VNC server, Apache, PHP or whatever else, then configure that software to run every time time you boot up the Pi. You can also do common tasks like assign a static IP address, set the storage modes and even delete files. PiBakery uses an interface that\u2019s very similar to the learn-to-code program Scratch. This makes it pretty intuitive and easy to use. Each command is a block that connects to another block so, to set up Wi-Fi credentials, you\u2019d drag the On First Boot block to the Set Up Wi-Fi block and then add your details. When you\u2019re all set, you can save your settings, write it to an SD card and you\u2019re all ready to go. PiBakery (Free)

VIf the idea of a robot fish swimming through your veins elicits a Cronenberg-ian chill up your spine, you might want to brace yourself. Researchers at U.C. San Diego have created the first nanofish, the New Scientist reports \u2014 a magnet-powered bot that they hope to use for targeted delivery of medication, non-invasive surgery and single-cell manipulation.  Developed by Jinxing Li and his team at the University of California, these new nanobots are 100 times smaller than a grain of sand and consist of tiny gold and nickel segments that are connected with silver hinges. An external magnet is used to manipulate the nickel and create a waving motion to propel the bot forward. The speed and direction of the little swimmer is determined by the orientation and strength of the magnetic field. Ultimately, the team hopes that their remarkable invention will be able to deliver drugs like pain medication to the specific area of the body that needs it. While other scientists have developed \u201cnanoswimmers\u201d for the same potential purposes, most of those experimental models are more like submarines than fish. Traditionally, bacteria\u2019s corkscrew tail has been the design inspiration for helical propellers that move a nanobot through the bloodstream. Experiments have shown that the nanofish is actually more efficient. Tiny metal mechanisms building up in your body might conjure visions of Tetsuo the Iron Man, rest assured \u2014 Li says that they are working on a biodegradable version.

V\u000aPlanning to get abroad in the car this summer to beat the airport queues? Or maybe you just want a staycation with a long drive to the coast or to a camp site in the wilderness. Keeping the car packed with snacks and drinks is one thing. But the latest driving tech provides peace of mind, safety and even relief from boredom along the way. Chris Price reports  TyrePilot\u000aAvailable from Snooper.co.uk from £179.99 with four wheel sensors\u000aReduce the chances of a puncture and save money by testing your car\u2019s tyre pressure. In 2014, the RAC attended almost two million breakdowns in the UK and a wheel change or puncture with no spare were in the top ten causes for breakdown. The TypePilot monitoring system can test the pressure of your car\u2019s tyres reducing the chance of a blow-out or puncture while on the road. Drivers will be also able to make sure their car is running more efficiently and tyres last longer, lowering overall fuel consumption. It works with both cars and caravans making it the perfect gadget for protecting all passengers and saving money on that long awaited summer holiday trip.  \u000aSnooper 4ZERO \u2013 protect against speeding fines and improve safety\u000aAvailable from Halfords for £149.99 (and a three month free subscription)\u000aIt can be tempting to \u2018put your foot down\u2019 when driving to a holiday destination, but the Snooper 4ZERO speed camera detector will ensure those on a getaway stick to the speed limit and drive safely. It\u2019s a small, portable device that sits neatly on a dashboard and will alert users quickly to the presence of police speed traps (both fixed and mobile laser speed guns) which are often located at accident black spots.

VFor a long time, the biggest question about Spider-Man: Homecoming was who out of Spider-Man\u2019s impressive rogue\u2019s gallery would be fighting the newest incarnation of the wallcrawler. We\u2019ve since had confirmation of two villains, Vulture and the Tinkerer, and now new set pictures have revealed a third \u2014 the Shocker.\u000a\u000aGod bless the Superior Foes of Spider-Man. Art by Steve Lieber. While Shocker, AKA Herman Schultz, isn\u2019t perhaps on the same level of Spidey\u2019s most famous villains, he\u2019s certainly a very recognisable one, thanks to his meme-worthy appearances in the Spider-Man animated series and his part in the excellent Superior Foes of Spider-Man comic. He\u2019s actually been rumoured to be part of Homecoming for a while \u2014 with Bokeem Woodbine tipped to play the part \u2014 but now we actually have visual confirmation that he\u2019s in the movie: A better look at Shocker from Spider-Man: Homecoming. pic.twitter.com/esTTsUIXpD \u2014 Ross Dillon!

It\u2019s not the slickest of costumes (it looks very thrown together), but it fits as an \u201corigin\u201d costume if we\u2019re getting to see how Schultz turned to a life of crime. And what are the odds his vibro-smasher gauntlets are pilfered Stark tech rather than Schultz\u2019s own design? Considering that a Stark has seemingly played a hand in almost every bit of tech in the MCU, it\u2019s probably highly likely. Tony is in the movie, after all.

p838
VStar Trek\u2018s Holodeck technology could conjure up pretty much any scenario you could imagine, but there were always a select few that the crews of the Enterprise, DS9 and Voyager would always return to\u2026 some more enjoyable than others. Here are every one of those recurring holoprograms, from worst to best.\u000a Voyager was home to a lot of maligned adventures on the Holodeck, but this recreation of a 19th-century Irish village was perhaps its worst. Two terrible attempts to make an idyllic Irish village a bit more exciting for TV: The time the villagers become aware that the Voyager crew can edit their very reality and assume they\u2019re witches, and the time Captain Janeway fell in love with one of the the program\u2019s characters and went slowly insane as she tweaked his program \u2014 even going so far as to delete the character\u2019s holographic wife \u2014 into being her dream boyfriend. And then slept with him. While other members of the crew were using the Holodeck. JANEWAY, NO. Thankfully we never actually get to see the many erotic programs (with such delightful names as the Vulcan Love Slave trilogy) that Quark offers in his Holosuites, but maybe offering a slew of holographic sexual encounters on what was meant to be an incredibly important diplomatic establishment for the largest political force in the quadrant was probably not the greatest idea. Considering Holosuites were smaller than your typical holodeck, can you just imagine the cleanup? Two centuries in the future, and children\u2019s edutainment will still be just as insipid (but now in the third dimension!). Used by Naomi Wildman on Voyager, this program followed the tales of the ridiculously saccharine Flotter and friends in the \u201cForest of Forever\u201d. Considering the likes of Janeway, Harry and Naomi\u2019s mother Samantha were aware of Flotter as kids \u2014 before the invention of Holodecks \u2014 maybe he was less annoying outside of the advent of holomedia. Although Brahms\u2019 reappearances came from her actual self visiting the Enterprise, her first appearance in The Next Generation came as part of a holodeck simulation of Utopia Planitia, which Geordi then gave a new personality to, wildly different to Brahms\u2019 own (gross), and promptly fell in love with while trying to figure out an engineering problem on the Enterprise. What is it with Starfleet offers and wanting to have sexual relations with holoprograms? Starfleet Medical should put out a PSA entitled Please, Don\u2019t Screw the Holograms. Suffice to say, the real Brahms was not impressed. A small ship without a social space like Ten Forward or Quark\u2019s, Voyager had to make do with holoprograms to create areas for the crew to meet and unwind\u2026 and then promptly forget about after they build a new one. Sandrine\u2019s \u2014 a small bar on the outskirts of Marseille \u2014 was the first of those forgotten social spaces. It was probably all for the best, as there were only so many times you could show your cast playing pool again and again before they were as bored as we were watching them. For a brief time, Captain Janeway ran her own personal program, a gothic horror/romance tale where she was the governess to a British Lord\u2019s young children in the wake of their mother\u2019s death. Maybe a nice excuse to get Kate Mulgrew out of her Starfleet uniform every once in a while, but it was dull as dishwater. It didn\u2019t click with audiences, and like many of Voyager\u2018s holoadventures, was dropped and promptly forgotten after a few appearances. Sandrine\u2019s direct replacement as Voyager\u2019s social area, Paxau Resort (with a few enhancements from Tom Paris, mainly scantily clad resort employees) was based off an elite Talaxian resort, but all we ever saw of it was the crew standing around the main entrance area, talking about the far more interesting things they\u2019d go and do offscreen. Vic Fontaine is a divisive figure among Star Trek fans. Either his jazzy crooning provided a crucial distraction for DS9\u2019s crew during the darkest moments of the Dominion War (or because it finally helped Odo and Kira hook up), or his silly antics and singing were getting in the way of the show exploring the darkest take on Star Trek as it really dug into the perils of war. It did at the least give us Avery Brooks singing \u201cThe Best is Yet to Come\u201d. Sometimes it\u2019s not the setting that makes a Holodeck program work, but the characters that inhabit it. Case in point is John Rhys-Davies\u2019 delightful turn as Leonardo Da Vinci in Janeway\u2019s personal program of his study in Florence. An area for her to relax and stretch her creative muscles, the best part of this was always getting to see Janeway interact with her maestro. Starfleet officers love themselves a period drama, and Data was no exception. The program was originally made to give Data a rival that could challenge his advanced program, in iconic antagonist Moriarty, but really, it was an excuse to put the TNG cast in as many period costumes as possible. That was always the main goal of holodeck programs, really. Likewise, Captain Proton \u2014 a pastiche of classic sci-fi serials like Flash Gordon, right down to the black and white filter it cast over the holodeck \u2014 was Voyager\u2018s excuse to have the cast out of their Starfleet jumpsuits. Campy in all the right ways, Proton is at its best when the rest of the crew beyond Paris and Kim get to join in on the fun in \u201cThe Bride of Chaotica!\u201d Janeway vamping it up as villainous Arachnia, Queen of the Spider-People, is a masterclass in fun scenery-consumption. Star Trek holoprograms are at their best when the team just go whole-hog with the setting, and Bashir\u2019s riff on spy-fi is one of the finest examples. A loving homage to the best of classic James Bond, the whole episode dedicated to Bashir having to stop a megalomaniac from destroying holo-earth is basically Star Trek\u2018s answer to Doctor No, and it\u2019s every bit as delightful as that sounds. If it wasn\u2019t the 19th century, Starfleet\u2019s favourite time period for holofun would have to be the mid-20th century, and Picard\u2019s love of the Dixon Hill detective novels was no exception. It\u2019s probably the home to one of the franchises\u2019 best \u201cHoloprogram gone wrong\u201d stories in \u201cThe Big Good-Bye\u201d, in which Picard and the crew have to solve a deadly mystery while the Holodeck\u2019s safety protocols are offline. Plus, after all, it was responsible for the moment Picard ferociously guns down a horde of Borg with holographic tommy guns in First Contact. We only ever see the baseball field Sisko adores so much once in Deep Space 9, but it\u2019s talked about so often \u2014 offscreen trip after offscreen trip \u2014 it still feels crucial to Sisko\u2019s character. It helps that when it does show up in \u201cTake Me Out to the Holosuite\u201d, it\u2019s completely amazing. The crew end up playing a game against a racist Vulcan Starfleet captain/baseball pro (!!!) and his team, and it\u2019s full of hilarious moments\u2026 including what has to be the greatest Worf moment in Trek history:  And that is why it will always be the best.

I\u2019ve already completed the Sudoku and the Times Crossword. What I\u2019d really like to do is sit back and watch a movie. Well pretty soon you may be able to. At least if Ford gets its way. According to Wired magazine, the car manufacturer has just patented an entertainment system that could basically turn the windshield of your car into a giant 50inch home cinema screen. The abstract for the patent, filed in the US at the start of March, describes the system in full, including a screen-switching function to flick between windshield mode and a smaller in-dash display. It reads: \u201cThe entertainment system controller presents media content on a first display while the vehicle is operating in the autonomous mode and on a second display when the vehicle is operating in a non-autonomous mode. \u201cA method includes determining whether a vehicle is operating in an autonomous mode [\u2026.] and transferring presentation of the media content to a second display when the vehicle is operating in a non-autonomous mode.\u201d But don\u2019t get too excited.

VTechnics 1200 turntable is due for comeback Nearly six years since Panasonic took the decision to stop producing the legendary SL-1200 turntable, parent company Panasonic has announced at CES in Las Vegas it is to produce a limited edition 50th anniversary model to debut this summer with the production of 1,200 models. A wider release of a consumer model is also expected in late 2016. Widely regarded as one of the most reliable (though not necessarily best sounding) turntables ever made, the 1200\u2019s powerful direct drive motor and solid tone arm \u2013 which was able to manipulate the sound of records without skipping \u2013 has been revered by DJs worldwide over the decades. And although many models made in the 1970s are still going, online petitions have called for the product to be re-introduced. While the limited-edition 50th Anniversary Grand Class SL-1200GAE will go on sale this summer there\u2019s also a non-limited Grand Class 1200G, expected to be available towards the tail end of the year. Panasonic promises DJ-level reliability and audiophile-grade sound quality for both models. However, audiophile-grade sound quality isn\u2019t typically associated with the 1200, thanks to its use of a direct drive motor, as opposed to the belt-driven motor often used in an audiophile turntable, reckons tech blog Ars Technica. \u201cThe high-torque direct drive motor is excellent for stability, very low wow and flutter (how much the pitch varies during playback), and swift start/stop speeds, but has been criticised in the past for suffering from \u201ccogging,\u201d where small speed fluctuations from the motor are transferred though the stylus, causing a degradation in sound quality.\u201d But while most DJs on social media are generally excited about the imminent return of the SL-1200 turntable, not everyone is so overjoyed. Says Evan Judd Rogowski on Facebook: \u201d Its not that exciting to me. I am sure they will dreadfully overpriced.\u201d The new 1200s are expected to cost several thousand pounds, with second-hand models currently going for hundreds on eBay.

p848
VIn the shadow of a cliff on an icy rock 700 million kilometres from Earth, a washing machine-sized robot by the name of Philae has spent the last two years in hibernation. We\u2019d already given up hope of speaking with humanity\u2019s first and only comet lander ever again, and time was running out to catch a final, fleeting glimpse of the beloved craft. In the eleventh hour, science prevailed.\u000a\u000aRosetta\u2019s lander Philae was identified in the shadow of a cliff on September 2, at a distance of just 2.7km. Image: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for OSIRIS Team On Sunday, during its second-to-last pass over Philae\u2019s likely resting spot on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the Rosetta spacecraft\u2019s OSIRIS camera obtained visual confirmation of the robotic lander, wedged into a dark crevice beneath a craggy cliff. The fuzzy, oversaturated photo released Monday by the European Space Agency (ESA) is the triumphant culmination of a two-year search, which intensified this past winter as Rosetta spiralled toward Comet 67P in preparation for a controlled descent on September 30. \u201cIt was a huge adrenaline rush to see this image on Sunday night,\u201d Laurence O\u2019Rourke, the Rosetta mission scientist who coordinated the ESA\u2019s search for Philae, told Gizmodo. \u201cTo have searched for this object on the surface for so long, and finally gotten an image of this quality and detail, was such a reward.\u201d The search for Philae began almost immediately after the lander\u2019s unexpectedly eventful touchdown on 12 November 2014. The craft bounced several kilometres over the course of two hours before coming to rest in a rocky region. From photos taken by Philae in the vanishing hours before its batteries drained on November 15, we knew that the lander had tumbled into the shadow of a cliff dubbed Perihelion. What wasn\u2019t clear was whether Philae remained in its original spot beneath the cliff\u2019s shadow, or if it had been blown elsewhere by a cometary outburst. Either way, finding the lander was going to be difficult, given that its most likely resting location received at most a few hours of sunlight per day. Phiael\u2019s view of its final resting site underneath \u201cPerihelion cliff\u201d. Image: ESA/Rosetta/Philae/CIVA Nonetheless, a search commenced, with scientists pulling together troves of data \u2014 radio signals sent from Rosetta to Philae and back, images of the surface taken by the orbiter and images taken by Philae itself \u2014 to hone in on the lander\u2019s likely location. A promising elliptical area, named Abydos after the sacred city of ancient Egypt, was soon identified, but actually spotting a lander in Rosetta\u2019s early flyby photos (taken 20km or more above the surface) proved nearly impossible. Another important clue came last winter, when Philae briefly woke up and beamed a signal back to Earth. As O\u2019Rourke explained, the lander had stored data on the position of the sun from the months prior to its phone call home. \u201cYou could take that data, plot it on the sky and say, this is where Philae would be if the sun were in that position,\u201d he said. \u201cThis very much helped with the search.\u201d Eventually, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team was able to narrow Abydos down to a region just a few tens of metres in diameter. But it wasn\u2019t until earlier this autumn that Rosetta got close enough to acquire the hi-res images needed to clearly make out a meter-sized robot on the comet\u2019s surface. \u201cDistance was the key,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe needed to be below 10 kilometers in order to start picking Philae out from the rocks,\u201d particularly the ice-rich ones whose gleaming surfaces have similar optical properties to Philae\u2019s solar panels. Comet 67P, with the Abydos region circled in red, as seen by Rosetta on 13 December 2014 from a distance of 20km. From this distance, Philae would only be about three pixels across. Image: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for OSIRIS Team MPS/UPD/LAM/IAA/SSO/INTA/UPM/DASP/IDA Throughout the autumn and winter, Rosetta made a series of low-altitude swoops over Abydos, photographing the rugged terrain from different altitudes and illuminations during the course of its normal scientific operations. (Only once, after Philae buzzed the Earth in July 2015, was the spacecraft\u2019s course deliberately altered to aid in the search for the missing lander.) All the while, the illumination grew dimmer as the sun migrated north of the comet, akin to the situation on Earth where winter days are shorter due to the sun being lower in the sky. In spite of the dying light, evidence was converging on a specific spot beneath the originally suspected site of Perihelion cliff. In addition to capturing several promising images between May and August, the team used 3D surface modelling and automated image searching to hone in on the lander\u2019s precise whereabouts. They also succeeded, on several occasions, in matching Philae\u2019s lost RF signal to the line of sight Rosetta was searching along. But the ironclad proof came in the form of the image captured on September 2, from a distance of just 2.7km when Philae was in Perihelion cliff\u2019s shadow. Despite the poor illumination, image processing revealed several of Philae\u2019s prominent features, including its metre-wide body and two of its three legs, extended. Several of the lander\u2019s instruments were also identified. \u201cThis was really like solving a mystery,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cGradually, we got more and more clues. We had quite a convincing argument to say this was Philae\u2019s resting site before the [final] picture, but a picture tells a thousand words.\u201d The Philae lander, rest in peace. Image: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for OSIRIS Team The discovery does more than offer the search team some well-deserved catharsis. \u201cBesides the satisfaction and public impact of now having found [Philae] and knowing where it is, this breakthrough brings new data to the scientific aspects of the Philae mission,\u201d ESA Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin told Gizmodo. During its 57 hours of activity on the surface, Philae collected troves of data on Comet 67P\u2019s complex surface, in addition to giving us an unprecedented snapshot of the volatile gases and organic molecules present on such a body. Knowledge of Philae\u2019s exact location at the time these measurements were made allows scientists to ground-truth these discoveries. Finally, Philae\u2019s tumultuous landing, and the quest to rediscover it afterwards, has given scientists and engineers plenty of lessons to ponder when designing future missions. O\u2019Rourke, for his part, has one modest request: That all future comet landers be equipped with emergency LEDs.

Currently not alien A photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on Sep 7, 2016 at 9:43am PDT  Blomkamp\u2019s untitled Alien movie, plotted as a sequel to Aliens that would replace the films that came after that 1986 James Cameron classic, has been the subject of much speculation. If he ends up making it, we likely won\u2019t know more until Ridley Scott\u2019s prequel film Alien: Covenant comes out next year \u2014 so it makes sense that Blomkamp would be filling his time with something else while he waits to get that project going. We just have no idea what that \u201cnew things\u201d refers to. Another movie? A TV show? A musical starring Sharlto Copley? Based on that image, perhaps something with a Hills Have Eyes/Mad Max/mutants/apocalypse kind of thing going on? Wild speculation seems appropriate until we know more. [Screencrush]

V Whether you\u2019re a budding YouTuber or just want a stable rig to get great overhead shots, you don\u2019t have to spend money on a pricey camera rig to get stable shots. This one costs less than $US35 ($46), is completely DIY, and won\u2019t take up a lot of space if your only shooting space is a tiny apartment or small side room.\u000a The video above, from YouTuber Energy Researcher, tells the tale, but here\u2019s the shortlist of parts you\u2019ll need, thanks to DIY Photography: If you have some of these lying around, you can save even more on the whole rig, but of course, prices may vary depending on where you live and your local hardware store. From there, it\u2019s really just about doing a little drilling to make holes for the weights and the mounting bracket, and screwing everything together and putting it on top of your \u2014 hopefully pre-existing \u2014 tripod. As nice as this is for overhead shots, you could just as easily use it for boom lighting or a microphone. Hit the link below for more, or play on the video above to see how it\u2019s assembled.

VLook, Suicide Squad may have had its issues on set \u2014 most of them stemming from sad enchanted wax figure Jared Leto \u2014 but they would have been even more interesting if they had happened to Shia LaBeouf.\u000a\u000aImage: Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Paramount Variety has a new profile out on LaBoeuf and he says that David Ayer originally wanted him to play the role of a Navy SEAL under Rick Flag\u2019s command. The part was eventually played by Scott Eastwood, and if you missed him, LaBoeuf can explain why. LaBoeuf told Variety, that \u201cThe character was different initially\u201d and \u201cThen Will [Smith] came in, and the script changed a bit. That character and Tom [Hardy\u2019s] character [Rick Flag] got written down to build Will up.\u201d Makes sense. There are a lot of characters in that movie, and Smith\u2019s Deadshot is a lot more important than one of the SEALS. And Smith is by far one of the best things in the movie and the most likeable he\u2019s been in a movie in ages. It\u2019s not a huge loss. But then LaBoeuf gets to the kicker, where he says, \u201cI don\u2019t think Warner Bros. wanted me. I went in to meet [them], and they were like, \u2018Nah, you\u2019re crazy. You\u2019re a good actor, but not this one.\u2019 It was a big investment for them.\u201d Look, this is obviously from LaBoeuf\u2019s point of view. It could be true, it could be a distortion of what really happened. But I would love it to be true. Just imagine the execs at Warner Bros. vetoing someone from Suicide Squad for being \u201ccrazy\u201d. Even better, imagine they didn\u2019t, and then imagine him at the receiving end of one of Leto\u2019s gifts, like a dead pig carcass or an unwrapped condom or literally any of the things we\u2019ve heard about in the last six months. I wish LaBoeuf had been there. Warner Bros. might have discovered that he was much saner than they thought. LaBoeuf is not all that crazy ... remember it's Hollywood.\u000aI watched some of his youtube show, you know the one where he hired out a cinema and played all his films back to back and set up camera to film his reactions... now that's performance art.\u000aThe batshit crazy is the Hollywood execs, feeding on their own importance and believing they know better than writers and directors and basically anyone else with actual film knowledge. I want to not like him but find him to be a good actor. His personal life and \u201cart projects\u201d don't concern me at all though and like most actors I would give him wide berth if I ever met him because of his social awareness issue and inflated ego. \u000a									Last edited September 7, 2016 5:10 pm								 He should be happy he wasn't in suicide squad.

p858
V  Unveiled at the Detroit Motor Show, this is the beautiful looking Audi h-tron quattro concept. A hydrogen-powered SUV, the h-tron quattro is closely related to Audi\u2019s e-tron quattro all electric concept car, first showcased at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show. Apart from displaying the possibilities of fuel cell technology, the concept SUV boasts an impressive 600 km range (on a single tank of hydrogen), the ability to go 0-60mph in less than 7 seconds and a refuelling time of just four minutes. Even the speediest electric vehicles generally take nearly 20-plus minutes to get a decent charge! The Audi h-tron quattro concept presents the fifth generation of fuel cell technology from Audi and Volkswagen. Lighter materials reduce the weight and, Audi claims, improve performance, responsiveness, service life and efficiency. With an efficiency rating in excess of 60 percent, the fuel cell now surpasses any combustion engine. The \u201cstack\u201d comprising 330 individual cells is housed in the forward structure with three hydrogen tanks located beneath the passenger compartment or luggage compartment. Like many concept cars, the h-tron quattro also features a whole host of connected car technologies including the company\u2019s piloted driving and parking technologies, hinging on what Audi calls the \u201ccentral driver assistance controller.\u201d The controller is a device that computes a model of the car\u2019s surroundings in real-time, making the information available to the autonomous driving and parking systems in a similar way to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, featured here. The combination of radar, camera and surround sensors supplies a complete model of the car\u2019s surroundings. A laser scanner monitors the area in front of the car up to 80 meters (262.5 ft) away. All the data is brought together in the driver assistance system (zFAS) in real time. The computing power of the zFAS is equivalent to the entire electronics architecture of a well-appointed midsize automobile \u2013 but the high level of integration means the board is the size of a tablet PC. The function for piloted driving in congestion currently being developed by Audi will in future reduce the driver\u2019s workload in slow-moving traffic on express roads by taking care of the steering at speeds of between 0 and 60 km/h (37.3 mph). The system also accelerates and slows down on its own. With piloted parking from Audi, the driver will be able to control the car conveniently from outside, via the remote control key or a smartphone. These features are expected to first hit the road in 2017 with Audi\u2019s next generation A8 full-size sedan. The hydrogen SUV also includes curved OLED touchscreen displays on the interior. Hydrogen-powered vehicles have long been thought of as a possible solution to the fossil fuel dependency of the car industry. However, as with any new technology the h-tron quattro and other hydrogen-powered cars face an uphill battle. As Chris Ziegler of The Verge notes, hydrogen vehicles don\u2019t currently have a network of refuelling stations and it will take decades before a proper system is built. So realistically we\u2019re still probably years aways from a true hydrogen-powered vehicle going into production. In other Audi News, despite being embroiled in industry scandal it seems that VW Group\u2019s reputation among car enthusiasts is still firmly intact as it dominated the 2016 What Car? Awards yesterday evening. The annual industry bash saw the troubled German manufacturer get its hands on half of the 19 awards up for grabs, including Audi\u2019s A4 family saloon which scooped the biggest prize of the night. \u000aAudi h-tron quattro concept \u2013 key specifications * The h-tron represents the fifth generation of fuel cell technology from Audi and Volkswagen * The highly efficient fuel cell with a 110 kW output combines with the 100 kW lithium battery for powerful bursts * Acceleration from 0 \u2013 62.1 mph takes less than seven seconds * During braking the battery is recharged \u2013 storing recovered energy * Three hydrogen cells are stored under the passenger compartment and refuelling takes a mere four minutes \u2013 giving the car an impressive 372.8 mile (600km) range * Fuel cell technology now surpasses combustion engines \u2013 demonstrating an efficiency rating of 60 percent  * Efficiency of the car is further boosted by a solar panel on the roof that generate up to 320 watts \u2013 adding up to 621.4 miles to the range annually * The model\u2019s structure is closely related to the Audi e-tron quattro concept \u2013 using a virtually identical floor assembly despite the differing technologies            Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related). When he\u2019s not writing about the latest developments in the connected home, he\u2019s normally driving his little smart car round town.

p862
VFollowing the recent recall of over 51,000 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in Australia, Samsung has confirmed replacement stock will be available in the country from September 21. The new batch will be identifiable by a small black square on the white barcode label along with a white sticker with a blue letter S on the box, and you\u2019ll be able to check your IMEI number on an a database to be set up on the Samsung Australia website.  \u201cWe would like to thank our loyal customers for their patience, and apologise for the inconvenience,\u201d said Richard Fink, Vice President IT & Mobile at Samsung Electronics Australia. \u201cWe have been working hard to get the amazing Galaxy Note7 back in the hands of our customers to continue to enjoy.\u201d Fink says in a statement Samsung\u2019s number one priority is the safety of customers, \u201cwhich is why we\u2019ve worked hard to provide new replacement Note7 devices as quickly as possible\u201d. Sales of the new Note7 stock will resume \u201cin early October\u201d. If you were affected by the Galaxy Note 7 issues, you can choose a new Galaxy Note7 (with a courtesy device provided until the arrival of replacement Galaxy Note7 stock) or a refund via either Samsung or your retailer \u2014 depending on where you purchased it. If you choose to get a replacement Note 7, your retailer or Samsung will be in touch from September 21 to organise delivery.  Until a replacement device is provided, don\u2019t use your Note 7. Back up your data, complete a factory reset to delete personal data, power down your device and return it to its place of purchase. Samsung says to call customer service on 1300 362 603 or visit the website if you need specialised advice. The Galaxy Note 7 will cost $1349 to buy outright in Australia. There may be slightly cheaper offers available from the likes of Mobileciti and Kogan, but pricing will be largely the same for the first few months after launch.  For anyone who prefers pre-paid plans over mobile contracts, this is definitely the way to go \u2014 provided you have a wad of disposable cash on hand, of course. As we\u2019ve said in the past, phone contracts tend to be bad value for money and they also deny you the ability of switching telcos whenever you like. With that said, here are the plans currently being offered by Telstra, Optus, Virgin and Vodafone. Telstra\u2019s starting price for the Galaxy Note 7 on a 24-month contract is $95 per month. As per usual, this is significantly higher than the competition although you do get a bit more data than Vodafone and Virgin\u2019s entry level plans. It comes with $550 worth of free text and calls per month (Optus and Virgin, meanwhile, are unlimited.) Telstra\u2019s top-end $123 plan comes with unlimited free national calls per month and 20GB of data.  Here is the full list of plans. [Note: Tables are automatically updated to reflect current pricing and may change over time.]  Our pick: Most users will be better off with the $110 plan. This nets you unlimited calls/SMS and 6GB of data. Heavy data users may want to plump for the next plan up which offers 15GB per month, although you need to pay an extra $35 per month for the privilege.   Optus\u2019s cheapest plan for the Galaxy Note 7 is $71 per month which nets you unlimited national calls/SMS and 1GB of data. This is the best entry level plan in terms of bang-for-buck, although most users will still struggle on a monthly data allowance of 1GB.   The top-end plan packs in 20GB of data for $120 which is just $3 cheaper than Telstra\u2019s most expensive offering. It also comes with unlimited calls and text.  Here is the full list of plans. [Note: Tables are automatically updated to reflect current pricing and may change over time.]  Our pick: If you\u2019ve got the cash, go for the 15GB $104 plan which provides more than double the data of the $96 plan.   Virgin Mobile is starting its Note 7 pricing at $67 which gets you $300 text/calls and a measly 300MB of data. The top-tier plans comes in at $120 and \u201conly\u201d provides 16GB of data. Here is the full list of plans. [Note: Tables are automatically updated to reflect current pricing and may change over time.]  Our pick The $105 is probably your best bet here. It comes with a generous 15GB data allowance and unlimited call and text. If you don\u2019t have crazy data demands, the $85/month plan if also worth a look. Vodafone\u2019s starting price for the Galaxy Note 7 is $74 per month. It comes with 500MB of data and unlimited calls/text. The most expensive plan will set you back $123. It comes with 20GB of data. Here is the full list of plans. [Note: Tables are automatically updated to reflect current pricing and may change over time.]  Our pick: If your monthly data demands don\u2019t exceed 8GB, the $95 plan would be our pick. (It\u2019s only $3 more expensive per month than the 6GB offering.)  As you\u2019d expect from a flagship phone release, plan hunters on a budget are going to struggle here: the cheapest plan is $67 per month and that nets you a useless 300MB of data. If money is tight, you might want to consider a plan featuring the previous Notes instead.  For everyone else, Virgin\u2019s $92 plan probably provides the best value for money. You get unlimited calls and texts and 8GB of data which should be enough for the majority of users. Hmm, this will be interesting. Handed mine in yesterday to Vodafone and was told to expect 4-6 weeks. Hopefully, they were just being pessimistic on a replacement date. If the handsets are in store before mine gets replaced I'm gonna be peeved. did you hand all the accessories back as well, or just the handset? No, just the handset - I purposely asked when I first spoke to them whether I needed to return everything. But they said it was going to be replaced not refurbed. Although I don't know whether that's just sales people who don't know one way or the other. To be fair I've already had to return one faulty handset (on the first day) and I didn't need to return the accessories, they just opened a new box, pulled the phone and switched them over. So it might be ok. Fingers crossed. I wonder if the recalled ones will make it back on the market as factory refurbs with the fixed batteries in them? Surely they won't destroy them all. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 9:17 pm								 I would like an iPhone 7 as replacement. No more Samsung for me You know there is other Android phones just as good as the S7, you don't need to go to the Apple ecosystem (unless you are just trolling). Praise the lord. Thanks to Telstra im stuck with a galaxy j1 mini...  Even worse, when i took mine back as per the request by Samsung and Telstra, I was told by the store assistant manager why I was even caring to return it. Its only a slim chance the phone will catch fire, he wouldn't even bother bringing it back. Good advice... On a side note I really hope there is some sort of compensation attached with the delivery of the new phone. I had $100 worth of screen protectors on the two units in our home. \u000a									Last edited September 10, 2016 10:09 am								 That's your own fault for falling for the scam of screen protectors. The glass they use on phones these days is more than capable of resisting scratches from pretty much everything unless you dropped it, and a screen protector isn't going to stop your screen from shattering to pieces anyway.

Bay admitted in another Instagram video that it was a promotional thing for RED Camera, a professional digital cinematography company. But he approached the whole sponsored-content thing in true Bay style, embracing the product placement while seemingly not giving a shit about it either. \u201cThey asked me what colour should I paint it,\u201d Bay said in the video. \u201cI said, \u2018Guys, you\u2019re doing it for advertising purposes, so why don\u2019t we paint it fucking green?'\u201d So far it\u2019s the only BAYHEM camera that\u2019s been made, no word if they\u2019re going to replicate it for Bayabes (Bay wannabes, copyright 2016).

VIf you\u2019re planning a visit your favourite theme park, take a moment to learn a little about the underlying physics of roller coasters, via the latest video from the folks at SciShow.\u000a All roller coasters basically involve Newtonian physics 101: inertia, gravity, acceleration, and friction. The higher the train rises, the greater the distance gravity must pull it back down, and the greater the resulting speeds. A roller coaster is constantly shifting between potential and kinetic energy, and the constant variation in forces is part of what makes riding a roller coaster so exhilarating. This is pretty familiar ground. But SciShow host Michael Aranda also goes into some cool details about the hydraulic launch systems used in today\u2019s coasters, as well as the permanent magnets used in cutting-edge braking systems (as opposed to the standard friction braking). Just something to ponder when you\u2019re momentarily hanging in free fall at the top of your favourite coaster.  [Laughing Squid]

VAre you looking to acquire a shiny new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus from Telstra? Here is every Telstra plan for both handsets so you can compare prices and data allowances to make the best choice. See also: Planhacker: Every Australian iPhone 7 And 7 Plus Plan From Optus, Telstra, Virgin Mobile And Vodafone Telstra doesn\u2019t break its handset repayments out so it\u2019s all inclusive in the total pricing. By far, Telstra has the most expensive iPhone 7 plans when you factor in the amount of data you get. (So, no change there then.) With that said, these plans actually work out a bit cheaper than Telstra\u2019s iPhone 6s offerings. The iPhone 7 plans start at $85 per month with 1GB of data, $550 of calls and unlimited messages.  All of the below plans include free Apple Music membership for between six and 12 months, free unlimited Telstra Air WiFi data until the end of March 2017, an NRL or AFL 2016 Footy Season Pass and 200GB of cloud storage through OneDrive.  All Telstra plans are on a 24 month contract. Here\u2019s the price of each plan and the inclusions (scroll down for our top pick, plus links to each plan): Our pick: The L plan is probably your best bet here: it\u2019s only a few dollars more than the M plan and nets you an additional 7GB of data per month. 10GB should be enough for most users \u2014 especially if you make use of free Telstra Air.

VSecond up with plan pricing for the brand new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is Telstra. Telstra will offer the iPhone 7 from as little as $85 per month on its Small plan with 1GB of data, $550 of calls and unlimited messages. All of Telstra\u2019s plans include a 6 or 12 month (on $95+ Plan) Apple Music membership, free and unlimited Telstra Air data through the carrier\u2019s network of Wi-Fi hotspots until the end of March 2017, NRL or AFL 2016 Footy Season Pass streaming, and 200GB of cloud storage through OneDrive. All Telstra plans are for a 24 month contract length. Give our charts below a moment to load\u2026       This really surprises me! Telstra has actually LOWERED the prices from the iPhone 6s to the iPhone 7? I was on the fence about getting one but now I definetly am! I preordered mine! Can't go wrong with unmetered apple music too! Also the $95 plan has 10gb data, bonus 2gb each month While price is lower, it still compares unfavourably to buying outright from apple ($1079 for 32 iphone 7) and negotiating a better BYO plan with telstra. Yesterday I was able to renew contract with them for $40/m 5GB data, $1000 worth talk a messages a month.  That's a $2039 for 24 months, but you're actually getting the equivalent of a deal between the 75 and 95 go. Just saying. Yep I agree. Once you factor out the cost of the handset you are paying at least $15 per month more for an inferior plan. Why do Telstra do this? And you have to lock in to a 24 month contract. So disappointing.  For those of you interested here's the maths. Based on a 32GB 7 plus. $40 per month Mx plan gives $1000 in calls and 5GB data. Total $960 over 24 months. Add the handset outright ($1269) gives a total of $2229. The closest plan above ($75 go) would cost $2568 and gives only 3GB data per month. So $339 more for 2GB less and an extra year of contract. That amounts to a 27% interest rate for the convenience of monthly payments on the handset. In fact if you wanted a fairer comparison you would have to buy the extra 2GB data per month ($20) to bring the total extra cost to $819. Telstra must think their customers are mugs! Now I'm not making phone payments for my 6, it will be an extra $25/mo to get a 7 and at least maintain the amount of data I get... and no headphone socket. No compelling reason to "upgrade"..

Chances are you will see a swimmer with one leg on the blocks next to another swimmer with two legs and two arms. So how that can be fair? The secret is a process called classification. Classification underlies all Paralympic sport, yet the concept \u2013 and its practical application \u2013 is possibly the greatest barrier to the broader community\u2019s understanding of the Paralympics. Classification is the process of allocating athletes into classes so that they compete against others whose impairment affects them to a similar degree in their sport. Read on to find out. Tony Naar is a Facilitator for the Australian Paralympic History Project at The University of Queensland The Paralympics are for athletes with a physical, intellectual or visual impairment. But not every person with a disability is eligible for the Paralympics, and not every athlete who is eligible for the Paralympics is eligible for every sport. Some sports, such as athletics and swimming, have events for athletes with any impairment who meet a threshold disability requirement. Other sports, such as 7-a-side football or goalball, are reserved for athletes with a specific form of impairment. The first element of classification is to determine whether an athlete has an impairment that makes them eligible for a sport. The second element is to determine their class within the sport. Sports such as swimming have developed a functional classification system, whereby every eligible athlete with a physical impairment is classified into one of ten classes (S1 to S10). This is based on the limitation their level of impairment places on their capacity to swim. This means that athletes with a spinal cord injury can swim in the same race as athletes with cerebral palsy or limb deficiencies. It also means that there are potentially up to 14 races for a single swimming distance in each stroke at the Paralympic Games. There is one for each of the ten physical classes, three vision-impaired classes and one class for athletes with an intellectual impairment. Sports with more restrictive eligibility criteria include wheelchair basketball, where athletes must have an impairment that limits their capacity to play the able-bodied game. Athletes are then classified according to their level of impairment within a wheelchair and given a point rating. Players with the least impairment receive the most points (4.5) and the most impaired players are low pointers (down to 1.0). To prevent the game being completely dominated by the high pointers, a team is limited to a total of 14 points on the court at any time. Wheelchair rugby has a similar system, with points ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 and a maximum of 8 points across the four players on the court. The high pointers are the glamour players, but everyone has their roles on the court. Trained medical experts carry out the classification process based on comprehensive data and analysis made over many years. There is a rigorous review and appeal process. But there is inevitably a range of impairment within a single classification class and it is an advantage for any athlete to be among the less impaired athletes in the same class. As an example, the Australian swimmer Jacqueline Freney was originally classified in the S8 class and won three bronze medals in that class at the 2008 Beijing Games. But Australian authorities believed that Freney had been classified into the wrong class. Following a process of appeal and review, she competed at the 2012 Games in London in the S7 class, winning eight gold medals. Had Freney remained where she had been originally (and incorrectly) classified, her London times would have seen her out of the medals in most S8 events. As the Paralympic Games becomes higher profile and more competitive, there is increasing pressure on the classification process to get it right, and on athletes to optimise their classification. The classifiers use a range of practical tests and observe the athletes in competition when making their decisions. Inevitably, there are claims of cheating, sometimes called intentional misrepresentation, whereby athletes pretend to have a greater level of impairment than is actually the case. The most famous example is probably the case of the Spanish basketball team for athletes with an intellectual disability at the 2000 Sydney Games. After the team won the gold medal, ten of the 12 players were found not to meet the disability requirements. The Australian Paralympic Committee employs a classification manager to assist athletes and sports in Australia and has an extensive classification program. Getting athletes into the right class and the right sport for them can make an enormous difference in their enjoyment of sport and ultimately their chances of success at Paralympic level. While it is not essential to enjoy the Paralympic Games, understanding the principles of classification can give you a greater appreciation of the principles behind Paralympic sport. This article was originally published on The Conversation. Its a good system, but not perfect.  There are problems when someone falls into two basic classifications for example, and in the end cant be classified correctly at all. If you are both mentally and physically handicapped, you only get put into one category or the other, and its just the extent of that handicap they rate you on.  There is no consideration given for the other limitation, and in the end you simply cant compete. Its become an issue in England at the moment and its a shame, because thats not the ideal they are trying to get across.  Not sure there is an easy solution either, which might mean its a sad situation where even when everyone is trying to do the right thing, people fall through the cracks. I read recently about the world championships for swimming for people with down syndrome. Not a single one is eligible for the Paralympics.

V\u000aIt\u2019s fair to say that betting has changed a little bit since the days when you had to queue up at the bookies with your receipt to collect your winnings. These days around 50 per cent of William Hill\u2019s business is online and a growing proportion of online betting (already over 50 per cent) is via your smartphone. However, one of the downsides of online betting has been that you haven\u2019t been able to collect your online winnings right away. Instead you\u2019ve had to wait three to five days before getting your hands on the money from your bank which really sucks if you want to show off to your mates what a winner you really are (obviously you will probably choose to keep quiet the times you lose, but we don\u2019t want to talk about that do we?) As Jamie Hart, William Hill\u2019s Director of Innovation and Customer Experience, told Tech Digest at the exclusive press preview of the product at the England v Switzerland match at Wembley on Tuesday: \u201cOne of biggest problems with internet betting has been that when you win you don\u2019t feel like a winner because you don\u2019t have the cash to celebrate.\u201d  But all that\u2019s set to change with William Hill announcing a Priority Access Card, the first in the industry. Usefully this will provide William Hill account holders with unrestricted and immediate access to their winnings. The Priority Access Card works by linking customers directly to their William Hill online betting account, rather than going through the bank. However, because William Hill has done a deal with MasterCard you can take out your winnings instantly at any shop, restaurant or other establishment with chip-and-pin payment or by visiting a cash machine (it can also be used for contactless payments up to £30). What\u2019s more, for those who don\u2019t want to show off the fact they have a William Hill MasterCard when it comes to making payments, the branding on the card is very subtle indeed with no mention of William Hill \u2013 just a swirling James Bond style pattern. Jamie Hart, Director of Innovation and Customer Experience, William Hill Adds Jamie Hart: \u201cThe William Hill Priority Access Card changes the entire betting experience by finally lifting the restrictions on how quickly customers enjoy their winnings, whether in social environments or to pay for their shopping. We have seen an extremely positive reaction to the card so far in pilot and are excited about the possibilities created by wider customer adoption.\u201d According to William Hill, The Priority Access Card received 100 per cent positive feedback during its recent trial period involving over 350 of William Hill\u2019s VIP customers, with cashpoint withdrawals proving to be a hugely popular benefit. William Hill is now opening the card up to all of its eligible customers. But that\u2019s not all. Future developments of the Priority Access Card Service may see brand partnerships that will enable William Hill to promote discounted offers to customers with significant winnings via their mobile phone. So, for example, you could be offered a bespoke holiday at cost price or \u2013 thanks to the geolocation services on your smartphone \u2013 a VIP discount at a nearby bar or restaurant. William Hill Labs is also working on new tech developments including full integration with Apple\u2019s payment platform, ApplePay, and a range of personalised services. Watch this space for more announcements due at a launch on the 29th September. Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related). When he\u2019s not writing about the latest developments in the connected home, he\u2019s normally driving his little smart car round town.

VApple spent a lot of time today explaining that the iPhone 7 is the most \u201crefined\u201d iteration yet. Which is just a fancy way of saying that this phone\u2019s design is going to look very similar to last year\u2019s phone. Aside from a slightly different finish for the jet black model (glossy!) and some redesigned antenna lines, and that apocalyptic loss of a headphone jack, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus look very similar to their predecessors. Image: Christina Warren/Gizmodo In a way this makes sense \u2014 over the last decade, Apple\u2019s design has come a very long way, and you would expect the design to plateau a bit. The need for radical changes disappears as the asymptote approaches what people really want. But far from just a listless can-kick forward, the iPhone 7\u2019s got some big changes that will surely turn some heads. Image: Christina Warren/Gizmodo There are rumours that Apple will be killing the home button next year, but for now it remains, albeit in hardly recognisable form. It\u2019s now a solid-state component with no moving parts. It makes up for this thanks to a \u201ctaptic engine,\u201d which gives you vibration feedback much like the buzzing of the iPhone 6s\u2019 3D Touch screen. Pressing on the button for the first time, I was shocked at the immediate vibration feedback. The good news is that while it\u2019s not actually a clicky button with moving parts, the very responsive vibration makes it feel like one. The bad news is, well, that the button vibrates. This is different than the slight vibration/feedback you get on the current-generation iPhone when you use TouchID or Apple Pay. It\u2019s more pronounced and forceful feedback. Image: Christina Warren/Gizmodo The Apple rep who demonstrated the new home button told me it took him just a few minutes to get used to the feel of the vibration. I think it may take some users longer, just because getting used to feeling a vibration under your finger after years of not having one is a bit of a trip. Mercifully you can adjust the \u201cclick\u201d sensitivity of the home button, and apparently even broader customisation is coming. By default, the sensitivity is set at level 2, but you can make it require a lighter or harder touch to click. Personally, I thought option one \u2014 which required just a soft touch \u2014 was the best. Even if the vibration isn\u2019t immediately your bag, getting rid of moving parts comes with advantages. For example, you\u2019ll never have to worry about a home button sticking or breaking again. Even better, it means that the phone is now waterproof. For anyone who has ever dropped an iPhone in a sink (or a toilet) and then had to immediately soak it in a bag of rice, you know this is a big improvement. Of course, the iPhone isn\u2019t the first water- and dust- resistant phone. Samsung, Sony, and others have been at this game for a while. It took Apple longer, but it got there. Image: Christina Warren/Gizmodo The flashiest feature by far of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is the new camera system. Broadly, the camera system on both phones has been redesigned to work better in low light and to capture colours more accurately and with better focus. The real story with the cameras, though, is the new dual-lens system for the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple slapped two 12-megapixel cameras into the back of the device, which work in concert. It might be the most powerful mobile shooter ever made. The key here is that the dual cameras aren\u2019t exactly the same. One of them has the same 28mm lens that\u2019s on the back of the iPhone 7. The other is a new 56mm \u201ctelephoto\u201d lens. This means that by toggling between the cameras, you get a 2x optical zoom \u2014 none of the fake-arse digital zoom that only ruins your photos. By default, you\u2019re using the wide-angle 28mm lens, but after a tap on the \u201c1x\u201d button, you immediately go to the 2x mode, which engages the longer lens that\u2019s zoomed in. Image: Dan Rubin You can also use digital zoom for up to 10x. The 10x digital zoom looks like terrible digital zoom \u2014 though in my brief tests it definitely had less noise than most digital zoom implementations. And I was downright blown away at what the software zoom could pull off at 5x. You still get a grainy digital zoom effect, but the distortion and pixelation around the edges was much, much less visible than normal. Unfortunately, the coolest trick Apple will have for the iPhone 7 Plus camera isn\u2019t ready quite yet. Its depth-of-field mode that will use both cameras to capture great-looking bokeh effects. Basically, the camera will take the foreground image with the telephoto lens and use the wide angle to help blur imagery in the background. This is a feature that won\u2019t be available until later this year, but the samples I saw looked great. Even better, Apple is opening up functionality to developers. too. I use a Sony RX100 MkIV as my day-to-day pocket camera. Although I\u2019m sure it will take better photos (and has more zoom) than an iPhone 7 Plus, I\u2019m not sure the difference would be worth it those times I really don\u2019t want to bring that (very tiny) camera with me. It goes without saying that the new iPhone models will almost certainly be the best iPhones made. Apple could probably shrug out a minor upgrade and tens of millions of people would buy it before the end of the year. It\u2019s refreshing that Apple appears to be trying to do things differently, and to move phone technology forward. Sure, maybe the home button will annoy us to death. And maybe the camera won\u2019t live up to Apple\u2019s hype.  But we can say these changes are different than anything that has come before. Indeed, though we haven\u2019t had the chance to fully review the phone \u2014 stay tuned \u2014 it\u2019s clear that the iPhone 7 is hiding some very big ideas in that very familiar aluminium chassis. A new type of home button and a better camera. My gosh, you are struggling to say something meaningful about the phone. She did say something meaningful: It\u2019s refreshing that Apple appears to be trying to do things differently, and to move phone technology forward.  BUWAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! "Apple appears to be trying to do things differently, and to move phone technology forward" Waterproof - done already about 5 years ago\u000awireless headphones - done already about 10 years ago\u000adual camera/depth of field - done 2 years ago\u000adigital zoom - done about forever ago, also a selling point really???\u000ahome touch button - kind of already been done 5 years ago, all they did was add varying sensitivity Yeah definitely moving the phone industry forward... Seriously how afraid of apple is gizmodo? every year without fail the inflated hype begins. \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 11:47 am								 but it is not just Giz. Read Wired or Engadget articles, and all the journos have forgotten what is already available in the industry. I'm starting to suspect some of these articles are just pre-written Apple press releases. Waterproof - "Samsung, Sony, and others have been at this game for a while."\u000aThe wireless headphones - as I understand it, it's just the pairing technology which is new, and seems to work well. The headphones themselves are just bluetooth and no one is claiming bluetooth audio is new\u000aDigital Zoom - no one claims it is new, it's been on all iPhones, in fact all digital cameras.  It's the two lens optical "zoom" they are claiming is new.  It probably is. That said, fuck you Apple and your headphone adapter dongle, and your crappy new overpriced wireless earbuds. Not a fan of the adapter but the price of the wireless earphones are inline with all similar products I've seen.  IDK about the sound quality but these days $250 isn't considered outrageous for earphones - especially not wireless ones. Yeah they have been done but badly implemented. Sony made the water proof feature famous but their speakers weren't loud enough.\u000aWireless headphones have been around for ages but all have to be worn with a neck ornament and the charging process requires more cables. These headphones get charged while you store them.\u000aLG and HTC has done the dual camera setup but not without it's issues.\u000aDigital zoom has always been an after though for all OEMs.\u000aHome button was invented by apple. I bet you own a Samsung or HTC. Like they don't copy Apple.\u000aWait till the next batch of androids come out. See what features they borrow from apple.\u000aFYI my daily phone is an LG G4. "Yeah they have been done but badly implemented. Sony made the water proof feature famous but their speakers weren't loud enough." - yes sony was one of the first, but there been plenty of others that don't have sound issue (samsungs). "Wireless headphones have been around for ages but all have to be worn with a neck ornament and the charging process requires more cables. These headphones get charged while you store them." -  actually there are a ton of good wireless headphones on the market that don't require a "neck ornanment" maybe you should look around. Again everyone assume apple re-inventing the wheel "Home button was invented by apple" - wasn't talking about it being button but the notion that apple created something new with a "touch" button as a first; its been around for a long time on many android handsets.  "LG and HTC has done the dual camera setup but not without it's issues." - well if someone has already done it then you proved my point correct. I'm not arguing that apple may of improved the ideas slightly "Digital zoom has always been an after though for all OEMs." - digtial zoom has been around for ever, nothing really new that apple is doing maybe then tweaking algorithm to calculate the missing pixels. It just basically cropping a image..  So what features are they going to borrow? when all of these have been done before? I don't care that they have copied, I'm just sick of everyone pretending that apple is reinventing the wheel all the time. \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 3:33 pm								 Oh you forgot the case for the heaphones needs charging which needs cables so your point is moot Someone sounds jelly.\u000aThe only new features Android type phones bring is more bugs. Oh come on - what about being a portable fire starter? well as iPhone does not have a  ton of features that Samsungs do you must be on something or are you an Apple Fan Bois? Why is it that the reviews for all the new phones is usually "this is the best one they've ever made". Shouldn't this be IMPLICIT? Why would they release a new model that is NOT the best i.e. equal to or worse than the previous model? Just like, say "new and improved" for dishwashing liquid... why new, if not improved? I've had an iPhone since the 4 came out, then moved onto the 5 and now the 6 (never had the 's' model). I've loved the iOS and the hardware up until now. As others are pointing out I'm really not impressed with the phone. You've literally done nothing great and have only implemented features we've been asking for, for years (water resistance). I have no incentive to go purchase this on a 2 year contract. I'll save myself over $300 and get the 6s. I'm very interested to see the sales of this model once the dust settles. unfortunately, they will still sell like hotcakes. Marketing! Yes i got the same impression as the other person that commented that gizmodo were really trying hard to justify this phone as an upgrade.the fact that they put a better camera on the plus model rules me out.i dont want that size screen.how stupid.ill wait till next year and you know what they say, next year is a long way away.i might get something else instead So without a physical home button and headphone socket taking up space, you gotta ask, why such big bezels??? Sammy is probably waiting until Apple does make the bezels smaller - Sammy probably has a design patent (as stupid as Apple's for rounded corner rectangles) on it. Yeah whoever grants patents for stupid stuff like that needs a slap. 2 Camera-Technology: HTC started it, Huawei p9/Honor8, LG G5 made it even better\u000ano Audio Jack: Oppo started it, made it's phone 4.9mm (iphone 7 is 7.1mm (while even the nexus 6p is only 7.3mm))\u000aHome Button which is no real button: Found on any device nowadays\u000aForce Touch: Huawei Mate S innovation seems a bit outdated apple, really. Citizens of free world,I've not yet been lumbered with a mobile device but I'm sure a headphone jack is universal thru-out galaxy. Call me old fashioned, I'd rather freedom of choice for best fit headphones for my 50 y/old Apple 33's & Apple 45's. Ungentlemanlike to fidget thru yuppie toiletries fingering pockets of ear wax,only to scream,"Where the .... is my adaptor! Wrapped in your lost phone-charger of course! Never ends.... Infinitely more droll than drool ! Buy more already!  Hooroo! I think its fair to say that Apple success comes from refinement not innovation. Even the original iPhone wasn't the first Smart phone in the marketplace.

VAccording to the US Geological Survey, a 5.3 magnitude \u201cexplosion\u201d has been detected in North Korea near the country\u2019s only known nuclear test site. North Korea has claimed to have tested nuclear weapons after similar seismic activity in recent years, but none as large as today\u2019s event.\u000a Image: USGS South Korean defence officials have previously used seismic data to estimate the kiloton yield of North Korea\u2019s test weapons, but unknown variables like explosion depth make precise measurements impossible. In January, North Korea announced it had obtained \u201cthe H-bomb of justice\u201d after a 5.1 magnitude earthquake in the region. International experts, however, have contended that the tested device was likely a boosted fission weapon and not a true hydrogen bomb. North Korea has not confirmed that this week\u2019s incident was a nuclear test, but, if so, it will be its fifth since 2006. Seriously, cant we either just nuke NK off the map before they do it to someone else, or just seal team six Kim Jong and his cronies for less collateral damage? At this point i dont even think China would bat an eyelid if their batshit crazy "ally" disappeared. Yes a preemptive nuclear war/assassination attempt would go completely unnoticed by any of DPRK's allies or neighbours. South Korea would be the first to thank you for creating a power vacuum of unprecedented magnitude right on its northern border. Shut up. I guess i shoulda added /s at the end of that.... I've seen suggestions of a yield around 10-20 kilotons, that's barely enough to say that it might not be a gun-type device. Hell, the yanks tested a a pure-fission (that is, not a hydrogen bomb) bomb design with a yield of 500 kilotons.  So with only seismic data and historical tests to go on,  claims that this could have possibly been a hydrogen bomb are almost laughable. Radiological studies could give clues to the components of the core, but given it was detonated underground, you would need to be inside North Korea to get the needed samples.

p888
VKeeping my glasses from slipping down my face is a constant battle. It\u2019s a classic nerd trope that holds true, for me, and I\u2019ve been losing the fight against gravity. But I\u2019ve found some help in the form of Nerdwax.\u000a Many people have no problem keeping their glasses in place; it depends entirely on your nose, your choice of frames, and perhaps the inherent oil slick of your skin. I\u2019m partial to plastic frames with retro flair, but unfortunately, such frames prioritise aesthetic above function and lack those little rubber nose pads that hold metal frames in place. The lack of rubber grips combined with weighty plastic results in slippy spectacles, particularly during a humid, slick New York summer. Even if you don\u2019t wear prescription lenses, the problem is even more common with sunglasses, which are often larger, weightier, and sometimes made from glossy plastic. I recently bought new frames and found myself constantly having to re-assert their place atop my nose, adopting that classic nerd mannerism. The new frames\u2019 constant slipping was annoying enough that I considered just switching back to my older pair. What could be done! Nerdwax is simply a beeswax-based substance that you apply to beneath the nose-bridge area of the frames \u2014 the part where your glasses make contact with your nose. It has a mildly sticky, tacky feel that works to keep your glasses in place. It comes in a small tube like chapstick. Does work? Yes, kind of. It helps. Once a day, in the morning when I typically clean my lenses, I also rub a little wax beneath the nose-bridge. Not huge gobs of the stuff; it\u2019s more like drawing a line with a soft crayon. It doesn\u2019t glue your frames to your face but it does make them a little more grippy. via Nerdwax.\u000aIt\u2019s not perfect, but it certainly adds some much-needed friction. Over time the wax wears off, distilled and smudged away from your natural skin oils. I only apply it in the morning, but some people apply it more frequently. It has indeed made my new glasses wearable. The alternative would be ungainly rubber nibs, nose pads, or some solution that would make it look like I\u2019m about to go play sports or ride a roller coaster and need my glasses to hold a death grip on my face. Call me vain, but I don\u2019t want my glasses to look like a medical device (which they literally are, I suppose). Nerdwax started as a Kickstarter project in 2014 by Don Hejny and was later featured on Shark Tank. (Mr. Wonderful and Kevin both made offers, but Hejny and his wife ultimately declined.) But life goes on, as does the wax upon my glasses, and you can pick up a single tube for about ten bucks on Amazon. Alternatively, retailers like Queen B are stocking it, or you have have a look on eBay. I still have to adjust my glasses quite often, but a little less often than before.

VDear LH, I have my Provisional 1 (P1) licence in NSW and my highest speed limit is 90km/hr. When driving in Queensland do I still have to stick with my 90km/hr limit or can I do the speed limit? \u2013 Alex Hi Alex, Road rules are confusing as it is. The fact that these rules differ in each state doesn\u2019t make things easier. When you go interstate, you are meant to follow the road rules that are in place in the state or territory that you\u2019re in. Sorry to burst your bubble Alex, but if you\u2019re on a P1 drivers licence in NSW and you go to Queensland, the restrictions you have on your licence still apply. That includes your 90km/hr maximum speed limit. According to the Queensland Government: \u000aWhen driving in Queensland under your valid interstate or overseas licence you must: Transport for NSW has clarified that you must abide by all restrictions that apply to the state\u2019s learner and provisional licences even when you drive interstate: \u000a\u201cAll licence conditions and restrictions that apply in NSW to both learner and provisional drivers and riders will also apply to them when they drive or ride OUTSIDE of NSW in all Australian States and Territories including their novice driver speed limits.\u201d\u000a If you are permanently relocating to another state, it\u2019ll be worth converting your driver\u2019s licence over to match whatever state or territory you\u2019re going to live in. You can usually do this after you\u2019ve spent a certain amount of time in the particular state that you\u2019re moving to. Just contact your local roads and traffic authority to find out about the process because, as with road rules, it differs from state to state. Got your own question you want to put to Lifehacker? Send it using our contact form. If you're a NSW P or L plate driver you're subjected to those stupid restrictions no matter where you go. However, you're very unlikely to ever get pulled over in Victoria or Queensland for speeding if you're doing the speed limit, because everybody outside of NSW knows how daft those laws are and won't enforce them. If you're a QLD or VIC P or L plate driver visiting NSW, you can do the speed limit just like everybody else. Thus not needlessly holding everyone else on the road up and subjecting yourself to a greater chance of getting into an accident by doing 20km/h less than the limit, the way that your NSW licensed peers are forced to do so  (google: Solomon curve). It's not only worth converting to a new license, it's the law after 3 months. I think the holiday double demerit points apply to interstate too. So if I was going to Northern Territory, where there's a speed limit of 70km/h for Learners, but I have a VIC Learners License, I can drive at any speed limit depicted at the zone allocated? NT laws still apply. A states laws dont suddenly become invalid because you dont live there Yet you're still subjected to the restrictions made on your license state?\u000aSeems like a Lose/Lose here. Well you are called a probationary driver for a reason :) Although the speed limit one is unlikely to be enforced.

VTo the surprise of exactly no one, Apple\u2019s new generation of iPhones will not include a standard 3.5mm headphone input. The decision signals the demise of an audio port that\u2019s been used for more than 100 years \u2014 and honestly, it\u2019s about time. The death of the headphone jack is a very good thing. Hear me out.\u000a Image: Shutterstock / Gizmodo The headphone jack is an analogue connection originally designed for old-fashioned telephone switchboards in the early 20th century. It can\u2019t transfer nearly as much data as a digital connection like a Bluetooth or Lightning connection. Plus, the headphone jack only sends information one way: from power source to speaker. But that\u2019s all beside the point. The most obvious reason why the headphone jack had to die is simply because the new wave of wireless headphones will be more convenient and enjoyable to use for everyone. For most people, wires are obsolete. The headphone jack has been outmoded for decades. Built long before the advent of digital audio files \u2014 the predominant form of music today \u2014 the headphone jack was known for its simplicity and versatility. Historians have traced its origins all the way back to 1878, when primitive versions of the technology were used by telephone operators. The audio port managed to survive a global economic crisis, two World Wars, and even the digital revolution. But enough is enough. New technology has arrived, and it\u2019s undeniably better. Image: Audeze EL-8 Titanium headphones\u000aAudeze CEO Sankur Thiagasamudram was one of the first people to recognise the shortcomings of the 3.5mm headphone jack, and he decided to bet big on the next generations of audio ports. The Audeze EL-8 Titanium headphones were the company\u2019s first to use the lightning connector and contain a digital signal processor, digital-to-analogue converter, and amplifier in the headphones, all of which are precisionused to make the music sound better before it hits your ear. \u201cWe have more control over the signal,\u201d Thiagasamudram told Gizmodo when asked about why he decided to build headphones with a Lightning connector. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the raw digital signal. So, we can do signal processing before we convert it to analogue and send it to the headphone.\u201d To put it more simply: Everything is digital now. The music players, music files, and the equalizers \u2014 every step of the process is handled by computers. It makes absolutely no sense to have a dumb metal 3.5mm cable connected to advanced devices like the iPhone. Headphones can do more with the digital signal produced by a lightning cable or wireless Bluetooth connection. Thomas Edison listening to a primitive version of headphones circa 1871. (Image: Getty)\u000aNew standards like Bluetooth and Lightning are also capable of sending more data at higher speeds between the headphones and iPhone. \u201cLightning has a couple of advantages. For example, we have bidirectional communication now,\u201d said Thiagasamudram. \u201cWe can send information back to the iPhone, like biometric data, [language] translation data, and audio quality information.\u201d Real-time audio translations would obviously be a huge win for everyone, but most experts agree people will buy whatever headphones are most affordable and convenient. \u201cConsumers will probably want wireless headphones more than they want a Lightning connection,\u201d Bluetooth SIG\u2019s director of developer programs Steve Hegenderfer said. \u201cFrom a user\u2019s perspective, they\u2019re not missing out on anything. They\u2019re actually gaining some freedom.\u201d Wireless headphones do offer more freedom, but that freedom comes with a tradeoff. They need batteries, and batteries need charging. Bluetooth headphones need to be paired to devices, and pairing can be annoying. And even if you get a device paired, the audio might drop out from time to time. In short, wireless tech still has a ways to go. The thing is, aside from the annoyance of charging and pairing, wireless headphones aren\u2019t much different than their wired counterparts. Apple obviously believes well-executed wireless is the future, and by eliminating the jack, it opens a lot of incentive for manufacturers to iron out issues and invest in creating really reliable products. The company that nails it could potentially own the ears of millions of iPhone users. And perhaps the most important reason the jack had to go is purely practical. Ditching the relatively beefy headphone jack opens up space where more advanced tech can be added to the iPhone. \u201cThe reason to move on comes down to one word: courage,\u201d Apple SVP Phil Schiller said during the iPhone 7 announcement. \u201cOur smartphones are packed with technologies, and it\u2019s all fighting for space. Maintaining an ancient analogue connector doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He\u2019s right. This is exactly what Apple does best: it single-handedly abolishes outdated technology standards that are begging to be shelved. Apple did it with the 10cm floppy disk, disk drives in your laptops, and Adobe Flash. Now, it\u2019s doing music-lovers a favour by killing a cable that\u2019s had it coming for a long time. This makes room for better technology and new possibilities. So the headphone jack is finally dead. And the saddest part? No one is going to miss it. Nicely one sided opinionated article there. The literal definition of an opinion piece ;) Except this article isn't marked, or position itself, as an opinion piece. It reads like a paid advertorial for Apple. Apple, who weren't even the first company to make a phone without a 3.5mm audio jack.  How's the floppy disk drive in your latest computer working out for you? What? Thanks for proving my point, the article hails Apple as some sort of saviours for their removal of the jack. Did you read the article? And comparing a floppy disk to the 3.5mm audio jack is the best strawman since Worzel Gummidge. Get back under your bridge "guest". I'd be stunned if your computer didn't have a 3.5mm port... Apple was not the first to make a phone without an audio jack. The ASUS GARMIN A50 android used mini USB for its headphones . There may have been others. http://www.cnet.com/au/products/garmin-asus-nuvifone-a50/review/ http://www.gsmarena.com/garmin_asus_nuvifone_a50-3139.php The Moto Z also didn't have a headphone jack and was roundly panned for it. And rightly so, in my opinion. My I-Mate JasJam Windows phone from 2003 had a mini USB port for charging and sound out. No 3.5mm jack. Only 13 years out. I would like to see two lightning ports on a phone. Is that what Giz is now? A website for opinion pieces? Because if that's the case then I'll be moving on to Engadget or Ars Tech, which is a shame because I like the community here (and the Aus content) but my interests lie in tech news, not ill informed blog posts- and I feel like most of loyal readers here are the same. This was a truly terrible article written by someone who obviously knows very little about audio. Was going to say the same.  There are significant negatives to removing it as well, and enough that its not even close to being a good thing, let alone a "very" good thing. Most other devices that use headphones arent wireless by default, and most top shelf headphones arent wireless either.  You limit the consumer to a breed of headphones that arent as good and are usually more expensive. Example: fairly common set of headphones, Beats Solo 2.  Wired version goes for $259, wireless version goes for $399.  Similar with Bose, with similar models charging an extra $100 for wireless. You also have battery concerns, with some of these headphones having reported battery life of only a couple of hours. There are enough questions that this is hardly a "very good" decision.  It might be understandable, but there are significant questions. On a separate note, now I know who took the g-man tag I wanted :) The most significant negative I can see is annoying all the people who've spent too much on wired Beats headphones :) The fact that there is already a huge number of people with headphones already who now have to buy new ones... wow. I would be interested to know whether Apple have telemetry from the current iPhones about bluetooth -v- standard audio jack use. Personally, I don't mind if the move is standard audio jack to lightning/usb but there's a couple caveats attached. 1. It's got to sound at least as good. 2. It's got to be convenient (having to switch between headphones and charger/data transfer is not). 3. If you're switching jacks then you need to ship compatible headphones with your phone, it shouldn't be necessary to buy them separately. I really don't want to see audio move to being entirely wireless. I tried going wireless a couple times and USB once at home (for PC) and it was far more trouble than it was worth. In the end I ditched wireless and USB and went back to trusty 3.5mm analog audio and I've had zero audio problems since. I completely agree with your sentiment.  As someone who has spent 5 years as a "roadie", working professional audio and lighting for shows for audiences exceeding 10,000 people- the cost of moving from analogue to digital is but one factor not explained.  People have handed me an iPhone or other smartphone, giving me a Playlist, expecting me to make it sound clean and professional. For some devices- that is not a simple task.  You also can not be expecting businesses to suddenly adapt to this "jump". This equipment is not cheap. My personal audio setup also costs me nearly $9000 in order to get my flac audio sounding precisely how I want it. It's a good thing I never bought into the apple ecosystem because the only good they have done for it is to get digital audio tracks off CDs.  They did not do that without people doing it themselves illegally first, of course, so they only get credit for getting the industry to accept the inevitable.  Don't try to fix what isn't broken. I was sure this was an Advertorial. Cue the apple fanguys.\u000aSo... you have to pay extra for a Lightning Audio connection?\u000aHearing is analogue, no further information is required. Let the users decide what they want, report back in 12 months and advise how much market share has vanished. Your understanding of the concept is unfortunately limited. Correct, hearing is analogue;\u000aNot to be confused with hearing is stereo.\u000aA 3.5mm connection will only provide a stereo track; whereas any digital media can be played with as many channels as in the audio file.\u000aThe bluetooth specification, A2DP which is again only stereo is not a great solution either. Each ear has only one eardrum.\u000aWhat is it that you do not understand?\u000aAll audio mixing is done then reduced to 2 tracks for listening then stored as digital equivalent.\u000aHave you access to Studio masters  or do you just relish misinformation?\u000aEverything else is just mucking about with the decoding and changing presentation to the listener. Nice to read a positive piece on this for a change. And there aren't really any "questions" or negatives that aren't answered by the adaptor included in the box (for those that really want to buy an iPhone 7 (onwards). How about two ports becoming one? That's a massive negative. If you break the headphone port while walking (not hard to imagine as it is a stress point) then you can no longer charge your phone! Break the headphone port, do you mean the actual port on the phone? Working in repairs for phones that fault is so low on the list of things broken with iPhones it's non-issue even by people who consistently drop their phones.  Audio and power port aside, Micro USB on the other hand is a terrible plug with many users constantly bending/breaking the connector by forcing the plug in the wrong way. Please let us know if you need to do more repairs to lightning ports when this phone comes out. The 3.5mm Jack is pretty strong but I would imagine the lightning port or micro use port would be weaker How about two ports becoming one? That's a massive negative. If you break the headphone port while walking (not hard to imagine as it is a stress point) then you can no longer charge your phone!Breaking anything is a negative. Death to the smartphone belly button!\u000aI'm all Android BTW... Still waiting for it happen. Both lightning and usb-c audio jacks have the same drawbacks. The end of the cable will become twisted and fray as it can't rotate in the socket. Also added expense of chips in the headphones. Step 1, obsolete something that just works and is vendor agnostic.\u000aStep 2, replace with something that allows vendor to control output (DRM) and license to other vendors.\u000aStep 3, make sure it's not as robust as previous solution and therefore breaks, requires replacement breakout cable every 6-12 months.\u000aStep 4, Profit. I'm not against changing from the 3.5mm headphone jack but it needs to be swapped with a universal connector, not lightning. You can't even plug your new lightning headphones into a MacBook, its exclusive to iOS. This leaves wireless as the only universal method for headphones (btw will the air pods work with other phones?) which won't be everybody's first choice for different and fair reasons. This means that the dongle stays around for several years. And I really don't want a dongle future its not a neat or clever system. You've nailed the issue. The headphone jack is ubiquitous. Lightning isn't. I predict what will happen is headphone makers will either make one (expensive) version of their top end phones for iphone users (forcing them to pay more, deservedly ) and one 'traditional' for everyone else. For normal (read 'cheap') cans you'll just have to carry another adapter. Well done apple, you've saved space inside the phone by forcing users to make up for it outside. That's pretty much how wired headset manufacturers do it at the moment - one with buttons for iPhone, one with buttons for Android (as Apple decided to do a different 3.5mm pin configuration from everyone else).  The manufacturers and market seem happy with that, so I guess they'll accept USB-C and Lightning versions for wired headsets going forward.\u000aWireless won't yet have those limitations - it seems Apple's Airpods will work with other Bluetooth devices. For the moment. I'm sure they'd love/are planning their own proprietary wireless standard. "It can\u2019t transfer nearly as much data as a digital connection like a Bluetooth or Lightning connection. " Says it all. The author is profoundly ignorant of basic technology. Yep, perhaps they could have phrased it better to indicate no one uses 3.5mm connections in any popular data transfer purpose. game over If you want to remove the 3.5mm jack then fine, but at least replace it with another port. Removing it makes no sense, you go from 2 ports to 1. Forgetting the potentially niche use of music whilst charging the device, the headphone socket is an obvious stress point as you would walk with music on. If you break your headphone socket, and it also charges your phone, you can no longer charge your phone!  And don't get me started on wireless ear buds, even the ones that are supposedly ear shaped fall out every 50M or so. If they aren't attached to wires, they will get lost or stood on by the person behind you. Not all old things are obsolete, the wheel is much older than the 3.5mm jack, I'd like to see you get around without it. "Everything is digital now" Except the sound waves produced by the headphones that our ears can actually listen to... that's still analogue.  You HAVE to go from digital to analogue somewhere along the line. The question is do you want a  digital to audio converter and an amp in every single set of headphones you buy or is it better to let the phone do that work? I'd go with having the DAC in the headphones. At least then I can choose a decent one. Yeah nah. In the case of my PC I'd rather had the headphones as the bit that just makes noise well. The more bits in the headphones, the more you sacrifice on other components. I'd also like to control the DAC process thanks and be in control of the components thats do that and not be at the mercy of some shitty inbuilt DAC on headphones ruinng things for me. Very few people who care about audio quality will buy a headset with the DAC built in. Receivers tend to have much better quality DACs, and inline DACs are by far preferred in cases where a good receiver isn't being used. Analogue conversion should always be done before reaching the headset, for maximum flexibility and reusability of the equipment. \u000a									Last edited September 10, 2016 7:42 pm								 Well that's the thing - with Apple pushing this, we might start seeing DACs actually in headphones of the inline standard.\u000aWhether it's in the headphone casing or inline, the point remains - being able to choose it is good. I agree, choice is good. Giving buyers the choice between using a Lightning headset or an analogue headset by having both options available on the device, for example. To the author of the article: there's a good reason why the headphone jack has survived for over a hundred years - it...just...works. Sssshhhhh!!!! Don't let common sense get in the way of an advertorial masked as a biased article. Your whole post is nonsensical.  You cannot listen to a digital signal, period. Wireless headphones are built with rechargable batteries built-in and the discrete electronics to bluetooth/wifi connect to your device, and a converter to change the digital signal to an analogue one. Some people like to listen to music longer than the charge time on the batteries, or like to be able to listen to music without needing to charge a secondary device before being able to do so. With a standard analogue output you can use ANY pair of headphones and you don't need to charge them first. Removing the headphone jack and calling it a smart decision is just ridiculous. It's like saying you don't need a water tap in your kitchen because your fridge is full of bottled water.. i agree with the rest of the posts, a universal adapter system if you get rid of the 3.5mm plug, but definitely need an option for a non wireless headphone. i agree with the rest of the posts, a universal adapter system if you get rid of the 3.5mm plug, but definitely need an option for a non wireless headphone.You know the Lightning port supports wired headphones? They're even supplying a Lightning>3.5mm adaptor with the phone? As others have pointed out, there are downsides to that.\u000aOne is that the lightning connection is less robust than a 3.5mm, another is that the port is used for charging. (You can get breakouts that support charging and analogue audio but they are big and ugly). What I don't get is why they didn't put a magnetically-latching 3.5mm adapter on the top or side: i.e. you plug your 3.5mm into a small tube with one flat side, that flat side has three terminals and two binding magnets and snaps onto the side of the phone. Almost no internal space used, doesn't take the lightning port, and doesn't have to be an obnoxiously large dongle. Is it dead? I thought Apple just removed it from their phones. From the furore you'd think that's exactly what they'd done - remove it from all existing phones.  Instead, Apple are just not putting that socket in their next model. Which people don't have to buy. I agree with the earlier poster re the issue of wireless earbuds falling out of your ears. Have fun with that while you're cycling, skating, doing anything that isn't sitting down. For me, it wold be only a matter of days before I was listening through one earbud because the other was lost or broken from falling out. Perhaps if they had some sort of wire that could wrap around your neck, perhaps attached to something so if they fall off you don't lose them. I'm not sure why they haven't got a design more similar to a hearing aid, where the headphone bud wraps around the top of your ear and sits behind it. It'd make them much more secure, not to mention providing more space for electronics and battery. Lightning port... Like the Retina display... Always amuses me. Lightning slow port and low Rez retina... I mean come on, a 'new' iPhone7 using out dated tech underneath, bring on USB-C connectors and USB 3.1 data/power/video/audio and a 2K screen.. Maybe we'll see those in the iphone9? (While the rest of the world is moving on from 4K)\u000aBy the way (author) the audio jack does not transmit data, it transmit a modulated analogue signal. the demise of an audio port that\u2019s been used for more than 100 years ... Errr, no.  We're talking here about the 3.5mm stereo jack.  That was introduced about 1964.  The last time I looked, this was not 'more than 100 years' ago. If you want to write about the 1/4" jack, then I'll agree on the age but until then, stop sounding like an Apple disciple. The same style of audio connector was designed in 1878 and while the 3.5mm version is newer it's essentially the exact same technology. You could probably use a 1/4" adapter and a modern set of headphones in something made over 100 years ago and actually get audio out of it. "It can\u2019t transfer nearly as much data as a digital connection".\u000aThis is possibly the stupidest thing I have ever seen posted on a tech website, since when are analogue audio signals a bunch of 0's and 1's'. I bet this person wrote the article whilst queuing at their local Apple store convincing themselves everything Apple do is for the better of the world. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 9:11 pm								 They should remove all the ports. Once they get wireless charging, then what is the point of ports. You can do everything without wires. Not sure if sarcasm? :) If not, they could conceivably do away with all ports now. Wireless charge, wireless audio and data. Of course, wireless charging is inefficient compared to wired charging. http://www.howtogeek.com/233205/why-you-dont-want-to-wirelessly-charge-your-smartphone/ And if you're having wireless connection problems for some arcane reason you're left with no alternative. At least if they retain a lightning/usb connector you have a fallback. Personally I like a little redundancy designed into my devices. "Everything is digital now. The music players, music files, and the equalizers \u2014 every step of the process is handled by computers. It makes absolutely no sense to have a dumb metal 3.5mm cable connected to advanced devices like the iPhone." I'm sorry but this is completely, 100% wrong. The speakers that generate the soundwaves you hear are analogue. Therefore the signal must be converted from digital to analogue at some point. If you can explain to me how it is smarter/better to do that conversion in the tiny spaces of your headphones, with virtually zero processing power, rather than in the comparatively vast space and computing power of your smartphone, I'd be interested to hear it. Once the signal is analogue, a dumb 3.5mm is all you need to carry it. You are also forgetting that you have always shad the option of getting a digital signal out of your iPhone. So while your article reads like Apple have taken away the 3.5mm jack and replaced it with something better, the reality is that the other options were already there, so they have taken something away and not replaced it at all. Certainly, there are situations where maintain a digital signal outside the device makes sense, e.g. in my music studio, I use an external audio interface connected to my PC via USB but I do that because the external box does a better job of converting the digital signal to analogue, but when we are talking about listening to mp3s from your smartphone, it seems to make less sense to me to externalise the digital to analogue conversion (DAC). After all, it's not like Apple have taken the opportunity to remove the DAC hardware from the iPhone, all that is still in there so you can use it's internal speaker(s), so I am seeing absolutely no benefit here at all. There may be some benefit to Apple but none whatsoever to end users, who have always had the option of using the lightning port or Bluetooth in order to keep the digital signal path, for an external high quality DAC or whatever. All Apple have done is take away the choice to either do that or just plug in your favourite headphones. And Apple are really, really good at taking users' choices away from them, they do it whenever they can. That users not only put up with it, but convince themselves it's for their own good, beggars belief. The problem is that this is a proprietary port.. this isn't compatible with any other brand of products. Let alone any Macbook. This whole adaptor thing is what we were using for phone that had 2.5mm headphone ports.. Did everyone forget that nightmare? What can I say? You sure have "courage" to put this on Gizmodo as a proper article.\u000aWith the content increasing sponsored, I am really questioning if I should move onto greener pastures. It wouldn't have been difficult to have the lightning and 3.5 jack for a generation.

VHere\u2019s your chance to share your feedback. The ACCC is holding a Communications Sector Market Study, today opening the door to both industry and consumers on a range of issues from the NBN to data demand and mobile coverage. It is time for a serious look at how we are preparing for the country\u2019s communications needs in an emerging digitally-enabled global economy, lobby group Internet Australia said, applauding the move. \u201cThis market study provides an opportunity to examine competition in Australia\u2019s evolving communications markets, recognising the significant changes in how communications services are supplied and used,\u201d ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said. \u201cThe study will assist our understanding of how these trends are affecting competition and ensure regulatory settings remain responsive to drive good consumer outcomes.\u201d Key matters to be covered by the study include the need to manage significant demand for data (which is expected to more than double each year for the next few years), the transition to the NBN and what this means for competition and meeting consumer expectations. Internet Australia has previously called into question the National Broadband Network strategy based on Telstra\u2019s ageing copper wires. \u201cWithout pre-empting what the ACCC might conclude, it is our view that under the Government\u2019s current directions the NBN will not be fit-for-purpose within 10 to 15 years. So it can only be hoped that the study will result in a much needed re-think about the communications infrastructure required for Australia to actually become an innovation nation\u201d. 2016 is the National Year of Digital Inclusion, an initiative to ensure that everyone has access to the Internet and the skills to use it. \u201cWe are not just talking about economic issues. Universal access to the communication tools of the 21st Century is vital to our social development as well. People with disabilities and people leaving in rural, regional and remote Australia are telling us that they have for many years been left behind when it comes to broadband access,\u201d Internet Australia says.  \u201cThis has been inextricably linked to a lack of competition in these areas, something which the NBN project was intended to address by providing a ubiquitous broadband platform on which all RSPs (retail service providers) could compete on equal terms\u201d. Internet Australia has recently called on the Government to review the performance of the NBN, citing concerns about the rate of subscriber take-up and a lack of accurate information about broadband performance. In a separate announcement the ACCC has proposed a Broadband Performance Monitoring and Reporting Program. \u201cIt was recently revealed that while it has now \u201cpassed\u201d three million premises only about one million have bothered to connect to the NBN.\u201d Internet Australia says. \u201cPerhaps one of the reasons why NBN is having trouble securing customers is that people are uncertain as to the sort of Internet speeds they are likely to receive, especially given that there have been reports of people moving from their old ADSL service to the NBN and finding their Internet running slower\u201d. One of the benefits of a monitoring and reporting scheme is that it would once and for all establish the speed differentials between the copper-based FTTN network and the technically superior FTTP network, Internet Australia says. \u201cNo doubt this issue will be considered by the ACCC in its Communications Sector Market Study\u201d. The relationship between mobile and fixed-line networks, industry consolidation and the transition to a new market structure and the emergence of new technologies and delivery platforms will also be covered by the study. Submissions are invited until 14 October 2016. The ACCC expects to release draft findings for comment in mid-2017 before publishing a final report in late 2017. The ACCC has set up an online consultation hub which includes information summaries to assist consumers, businesses, and smaller retail service providers to submit their views. The ACCC will examine information collected from submissions and through further targeted consultation including specific information requests and potentially, public forums. The ACCC has also today commenced an inquiry into whether to declare a mobile roaming service. The roaming inquiry is being undertaken separately to the market study so the roaming declaration question can be resolved ahead of the market study\u2019s conclusion. Broader issues in relation to the mobile sector will still be explored in the market study. The ACCC uses market studies for a variety of reasons to support its various functions. Market studies enable the identification of competition issues, market problems, and possible solutions. Alternately, a market study may confirm competition in the relevant markets is functioning effectively and no action is needed. The ACCC has been increasingly using market studies as a tool for this purpose. It has recently completed the East Coast Gas Inquiry and is currently undertaking market studies of the cattle and beef markets, the new car retailing industry and the dairy sector. WTF, give everyone you can FTTH with a minimum download speed of 100Mbs at less than $100/month and be done with it. And where can you find the reports of people moving from ADSL to the NBN and finding their Internet running slower (except for the service provider CNT Corp)? My grandparents moved to the NBN because they had no choice, and while it is generally faster than what they had, it's been extremely temperamental - it would at times run very slow, and even stop working completely, their phone wouldn't work and they were getting phantom phone rings. It's been over 6 months and they are still having trouble with it. Anecdotally most of the issues I've have been involved with smaller ISP's so however they are servicing their customers may be the issue. @travisnew87 Telstra\u000aFunnily enough. I'm not following? Thought you were talking to me, as you replied to my comment. So I was just saying, my grandparents's NBN ISP is Telstra (so not a smaller ISP), and they still have continued problems. I have to laugh when I read that there is discussion about whether the FTTN version of NBN will be sufficient in the future.  The fact is that the service as provided is not fit for purpose at present.\u000aIt is ridiculous that at the best of times I have to make do with a line speed of 10% of possible line speed because the nearest "Node" is 900mtrs (as the crow flies) and 1.8kms away from me via Telstras line.  Not only that but There is no "real best of times". I can only get my best download speed from my filehost in the early hours of the morning. During peak periods of afternoon and evening weekdays and from early morning all day weekends my throughput speed drops to between 20 kbytes per second to a max of about 300 kbytes per second, apparently due to an NBN fault in the Mackay/Bundaberg area that is not high on the repair list.  I find it astounding that NBNco were allowed to put a service on the market when it is not fully functional nor fit for pupose. \u000a									Last edited September 5, 2016 1:58 pm								 I will be providing my feedback, but lets face it that nothing will change with the NBN mess. To change the design would show that Malcolm was a total failure and that won't happen while he is leader. I think my biggest quibble with NBN is the default speed tier. Tier 1 is only 12mbps download - that's far less than the theoretical speed of ADSL2+ (25mbps) from which many people will be transitioning. So maintaining current speed incurs a charge - to me, that is a blatant attempt to exploit non-tech savvy users. 12mbps seems pretty reasonable as an entry point, the 1mbps upload seems pretty stingy though. I'd rather consistant 12mbps than theoretical 25mbps that grinds to a halt as soon as a few people start using it! Not sure if it'll be consistent though! \u000a									Last edited September 5, 2016 1:56 pm								 IS that all it is? 12 mbps. Jeez. Also I never got why upload speeds are always so low with any ISP in Australia. I think right now, my biggest opinion is WHY haven't we got it yet? I live near a big Telstra exchange which has had it for ages, but seems to only cater for some businesses in the suburb, which means all the lines would have been put there already? We seem to be get taken off and put back on the list every time. We'll probably get it towards the end of the rollout but if it is anything like users have described and costs you more I'm sticking with my adsl2+ thanks I would love to get 12mb/s, I currently get (not kidding) 2mb/s at best (200KB/s). But not only is the current service incredibly bad in my suburb (in a major capital city, a large inner suburb) but we not getting NBN before 2020. Awesome. 3 year plan doesn't list the entire voting region.  I don't care what happens, all I know is I want the f**king politicians removed from the process. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 12:17 pm								 I feel awful for your situation and similar ones. My area got switched to nbn very early, but I ALREADY had cable through Telstra. I didn't need it, nor did my area, which was also furbished with access to ADSL2+ within 2km of an exchange. Boggles the mind why my area was early on the roadmap. I have 100mbit fttn and when nobody in my area is on it it's great 100mbit easy downloading a ~10MB/s from steam but at peak times now more and more people are on it I'm down to about 12mbit/s according to the speed test. I dont know if the bottle neck is the copper still in the system or a lack of bandwith at my exchange but whatever the reason it can't keep up I have no idea what will happen once the majority of my area is on it but I dont think it will end up much faster than ADSL Who's your provider? Our opinions? Its a joke. Decades out of date and has been ruined by the LNP. There's your opinion That's more fact than opinion. Libs knowingly wasted billions on a system inadequate and outdated before even installed, and took advantage of the tech illiterate to try and make labour look like they were wasting money.  They crippled our future, and in my opinion, when we inevitably move to fttp, libs should foot the bill as compensation for their blatant manipulation of the uneducated public and waste of taxpayers money. Agreed, accountability for baseless claims. I've been on 100/40 FTTP since February.  One of the more difficult things was to try to determine which company would have the back haul to meet the demands of this new high speed front end.  Unfortunately the only one that I had any confidence in was Telstra so I have continued my connection through them.  That's not to say that they're the only ones, I just have experience with them.  They're a known quantity to me. Frankly, it's been almost perfect since the day I was connected.  The transfer from my cable internet was faultless and, except for Telstra's well documented network woes, I really cannot complain. That said, I am now considering moving interstate.  The very high chance that I'll lose my precious fibre connection is very high on the list of reasons to stay. So much of what I do now revolves around the quality of my internet connection I'm reluctant to let it go.  Telecommuting (my connection from home is faster and more stable than when I'm in the office!), the YouTube, and Netflix are just a few. I was ecstatic when I found out that I was going to have the, pre-turnbulled, fibre version of the NBN but now it's becoming a problem because I really should move out of my house but the precious, it calls to me.

VThe Apple Watch was destined to be a disappointment when it launched in 2015. Many prophesied that it\u2019d usher in a golden age of wearables, much like the iPhone did for smartphones. But that didn\u2019t really happen. Maybe the Apple Watch Series 2 can change the narrative.\u000a\u000aTo kick things off, Tim Cook spent a ton of time lauding Apple\u2019s first try at the smartwatch, and Apple\u2019s Jeff Williams walked through watchOS 3 updates revealed at WWDC earlier in June, including that dubiously scientific Breathe app. Next up was app developer Niantic, which announced that its hit game Pokemon GO would be coming to the Apple Watch. However, this isn\u2019t just a port of the mobile game to the watch, which would suck horribly. Instead, the watch works with your iPhone to incorporate the step counter seamlessly, so you don\u2019t have to keep the app open. Then, finally, came the new hardware. The Apple Watch Series 2 is completely \u201cswimproof\u201d with water resistance up to 50m. Apple redesigned the speaker system to help eject water from the watch after you take a plunge. On the more geeky specs side of things, Apple introduced a 50 per cent faster processor along with better graphics. It also comes with the brightest display Apple has ever made. It\u2019s 1000 nits, which is really, really bright. For a comparison, most displays don\u2019t go much further than 400 nits. But Apple Watch: Part Deux\u2019s marquee feature is GPS, which helps make the Apple Watch somewhat less dependent on your iPhone \u2014 at least for maps and fitness apps. During today\u2019s presentation, Apple spent quite a bit of time on a new fancy hiking app that\u2019s only possible with Apple Watch\u2019s new GPS abilities. But all of this is hardly new \u2014 many Android Wear smartwatches have GPS already. With a brighter display and added GPS, Apple hasn\u2019t yet made any mention about upgrades to the Apple Watch\u2019s battery, though previous rumours have said that the new Watch comes with a 35 per cent bigger battery. However, with GPS added, it may all come out about equal. The new ceramic Apple Watch Series 2 Nike Watch Aside from new sensors, Apple also introduced a new ceramic model \u2014 it\u2019s most durable model \u2014 as well as a Nike specific model that\u2019s being marketed for all the runners in the world (of which I am not one). Apple Watch Series 2 will start at $529. The original Apple Watch, now called Series 1, will stay and come with the new processor. It starts at $399. Series 2 goes on sale September 16 while the Nike watch will arrive in October.

VEvery financial adviser on the planet has some suggestion for what the most important \u201cretirement number\u201d is. Some are even valid guidelines! But the one most tend to leave out is how much you\u2019ll spend.\u000a\u000aPhoto by Nancy Nance. In case you haven\u2019t thought about the basic principle in a while, retirement works like this: Once you\u2019ve saved up enough money, you can stop working and live off just what you\u2019ve saved for the rest of your days. Sounds simple, right? Except not everyone has the same expenses in retirement (just like during rest of your life). One person may want to travel the world and live in an expensive city, while another person may want to spend their days in a paid-off house quietly sitting on their front porch and tending to their small home garden. As personal finance site Budgets Are Sexy explains, this expense gap is key to understanding your retirement. While you can\u2019t know exactly all the expenses you\u2019ll have when you\u2019re older, you can at least try to make an estimate: \u000aHow can anyone tell you you\u2019ll need $2 million or $3.5 Million without having the slightest clue how much your lifestyle costs? Does a person living off $1,000/mo need the same as someone going through $10,000/mo? Do we all have the same hobbies and dreams and future goals in life? Or do we all just suck so bad that we need to hoard as much $$$ as we can \u2018cuz we\u2019re all doomed?\u000a While you\u2019re planning your retirement, ask yourself what kind of lifestyle you want to live. What hobbies do you want to take up? How much travelling do you want to do? While you\u2019re at it, what kind of medical expenses do you think you might face based on your family history and the way you\u2019ve lived so far? You\u2019ll never come up with a perfect answer, but thinking about the way you plan to live will have just as much (if not more) of an impact as blindly following a chart you saw online 40 years before you retire. Finally \u2014 The Magic Number You Need to Retire!! [Budgets Are Sexy] Superannuation funds will hate people knowing this!

VThe investigation into the collapse of electronics retailer Dick Smith has thrown up some amazing statistics relating to a key reason for the company going into administration \u2014 it was carrying too much stock. This article originally appeared on Business Insider In the Supreme Court, questions from receivers Ferrier Hodgson revealed the extent of Dick Smith\u2019s love of its own private label. According to former company secretary and investor relations head David Cooke, the company had enough Dick Smith AA Battery 40-packs to cover demand for 141 months  \u2013 almost 12 years. Three months before the company collapsed, it also had 131 months worth of Dick Smith AAA Battery 30-packs. Dick Smith collapsed after downgrading the value of stock it held.  Much of it was obsolete with little prospect of anyone buying it. Administrators were appointed on January 4 and the last day of trading was May 3. According to the Australian Financial Review, Cook was also questioned about why management continued to open new stores and increased its bank loans when same-store sales were falling. Ten former Dick Smith directors and managers have been summonsed to appear before the court hearings. The collapse of Dick Smith is likely to mean a shortfall to creditors of more than $260 million. The administrators, McGrathNicol, say the banks will get some money back but there\u2019s little prospect of anything for unsecured creditors including shareholders and those with Dick Smith gift cards. McGrathNicol says Dick Smith failed because the company was carrying too much stock it couldn\u2019t sell and did not have enough cash to fund rapid expansion. After about 2-3 years the regular AA/AAA battery would be completely flat. Energizer & duracell have spent a lot of money guaranteeing 60% of battery life for 10 years, and I doubt dick smith's manufacturers would have access to that same battery formula. i don't think the limitations of the tech are the issue the article is attempting to highlight - rather that the business decisions being made by those in charge were, at best, questionable. Bought a massive pack of Kirkland AAA from Costco a couple of months ago. Expected it to last me 2-3 years (I don't use a lot of batteries). Pulled it out the other day and one had exploded in the package. Maybe they were expecting a surge in Dildo sales. Well  "smith" is a common term for somebody who creates things, like wordsmith, blacksmith etc.  I suppose therefore that a dicksmith might be selling those. My hat goes off to you. That is the funniest Dick name gag I've heard since seeing his self titled cheese sitting on the store shelf. A lot of companies do this when they know they are failing, they will order more stock than they need, so when they go into administration, the stock on hand will be held by a liquidation company (even items on credit or unpaid) and sold off at a fraction of the price to cover expenses Huh? Wouldn't it make more sense to not buy all that stock, and use the money not spent to cover expenses? Why would you sell excess stock at a fraction of the price when you can just have all the money by not spending it frivolously? you idiot...they didnt pay for the new stock they got it on credit, so by selling it at a fraction of what it would have cost they made heaps from nothing.  Wake up! When you have a trade relation with these big companies, you usually have a 30-90 day credit window, so you send them the stock and and they don't have to pay till the due date, but when they go into administration, the company is taken over by liquidation company and they hold everything in the stores and warehouse as assets, including any unpaid stock, their first goal is to sell all the items to cover their own cost then the employees wages and they could sell stock at anything from 1c to 50c to the dollar, they say they do this to help pay off any expenses, but they almost never pay the suppliers, I lost close to $40,000 to one distributor a few years ago this way, was a good lesson I learnt \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 9:19 pm								 Because bonuses for saving money on purchasing.

VAn incredible 19,000 light years away, in the Sagittarius constellation, lies a brilliant star cluster unlike any other. A new analysis indicates that Terzan 5 is a \u201cfossil relic\u201d from the formation of the Milky Way \u2014 and it could help us piece together our cosmic origin story.\u000a\u000aTerzan 5, a stellar cluster with an unusual mix of stars that indicates it was a primordial building block of the Milky Way. All Images: ESO/F. Ferraro For 40 years, Terzan 5 was taken for a globular cluster, a brilliant region of gravitationally-bound space that packs thousands of stars into the distance between our Sun and Alpha Centauri. But after scouring data on this patch of sky collected with the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope and space-based companions, an Italian-led team of astronomers has learned it\u2019s like no globular cluster ever studied before. Globular clusters are ancient \u2014 nearly as old as the galaxy itself \u2014 and their stars tend to form in a single, brief burst of cosmic time. Terzan 5, however, contains two distinct populations of stars. The dominant population formed some 12 billion years ago, consistent with the age of most known globular clusters. But a second population didn\u2019t form until seven billion years later, around the same time as our Sun. The higher metal content of the younger generation indicates these stars were polluted with heavy elements generated during supernovae explosions from the older generation. \u201cNo genuine globular cluster was able to retain the gas ejected by supernovae,\u201d lead study author Francesco Ferraro told Gizmodo in an email. Location of the Terzan 5 cluster in the constellation Sagittarius. Image: ESO/IAU and Sky & Telescope As Ferraro and his colleagues write in a new scientific paper, this unusual situation makes Terzan 5 an ideal representative of a key stage in the formation of our galaxy and many others \u2014 the assembly of a densely packed, central core known as the \u201cgalactic bulge\u201d. Theory indicates that the formation of the Milky Way\u2019s bulge, some 12 billion years ago, relied on the interaction between enormous clumps of gas and stars, which merged and dissolved in the process. Astronomers have observed this interaction taking place in faraway galaxies at high redshifts. The size of Terzan 5\u2019s second population of stars tells us that a tremendous amount of gas was present in this patch of space during bulge assembly. What\u2019s more, the supernovae explosions required to infuse the younger stars with heavy metals would have ejected a large amount of material out of the system entirely. Taken together, the evidence indicates that when the Milky Way\u2019s bulge was forming, Terzan 5 would have been 500 to 1000 times heavier than it is today. It was a monster in the sky, laden with primordial gas. \u201c[Terzan 5] is the relic of a structure that was much more massive in the past: a fossil of the epoch of the galaxy formation,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cSuch galactic fossils allow us to reconstruct an important piece of history of our Milky Way.\u201d Ferrano and his co-authors are now conducting an extensive search for other stellar systems similar to Terzan 5, which could help us learn more about how our galaxy, and others like it, assembled. Like archaeologists sifting through dust to unearth clues about past civilisations, astronomers are now sifting through layers of information encoded in starlight. The history books are going get a lot longer as a result. What's incredible about being 19,000 light years away?

VVodafone is first out of the gates with its on-contract pricing for the brand new iPhone 7. Vodafone will offer the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus on a range of plans, starting from as little as $40 per month and a total cost of $76 per month including handset repayment. Vodafone is offering the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus on its Red mobile plans, which range from $40 per month for 1GB of data to $120 per month for 22GB of data. The telco is also offering the phone on its Red Play plans, which include 12-month subscriptions to Spotify and Stan, but have less included data as a consequence. The starting price for the 32GB iPhone 7 is $76 per month on a $40 Red plan, which includes 1GB of data, unlimited national calls and national text messages. The starting price for the 32GB iPhone 7 Plus is $85 per month on the same $40 Red plan. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll pay on Vodafone\u2019s plans \u2014 including the monthly handset repayment which varies for different storage capacities of both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, for a total monthly cost: Give our charts below a moment to load\u2026       It's interesting how a price is quoted for the plan and then an add-on for the handset. In truth you are paying more for the plan. The $60 plan (4GB) is available for $39 for a SIM only 24 month plan. So in effect you are paying $23 for the handset and an extra $21 for the plan, taking the total monthly cost to $44, or $1056 for the total cost of the (base model) handset. So basically no saving and you are locked in for 24 months. Bad deal. What kind of logic is this? You're paying for their service. You know, the ability to make calls and download data? I don't think you quite got the gist of what I was saying here. It's comparing the cost over 24 months of being on a plan or buying the phone outright and going on a sim only plan. Once upon a time you could get significant discount on the handset by contracting over 24 months but that is not the case on these plans. What he's referring to is the cost difference between paying for a phone through a traditional handset cost where the Telco advertises a cost fkr the plan + a cost for the handset versus purchasing a phone outright and putting it on a BYOD type of plan. He's stating that simply taking the device cost that the carrier quotes and multiplying it by 24 isnt a correct representation of how much the phone will cost you.  The handset contracts that telco advertise already have a built in base amount you end up paying for the phone, to the point that there is almost no cost difference overall. How about you slow down, And actually read what he said? If you do the maths it actually works out being cheaper than going on the sim plan and buying the phone outright. Plus vodafone have  joined the rest of the telcos by providing new phone early upgrades so you arent locked in for 24 months. So im wondering what your basing the "bad deal" on?? Totally agree with you @guy, these plans are not value for money. They have also taken out Unlmited International calling on their Red Plans. Few months ago, Vodafone was offering $15 off on their Red Plans for example I got iPhone 6S 64GB Offer for $80 including handset repayments with 10GB data + Unlimited International calling to 10 countries + 6 months Stan or Spotify subscription on top of it. If we compare it to an optus sim plan you get 15gb for $50 per month. So compare that with the 11gb for $96. $46 per month more. For 4gb less. 46x24 is $1104. For a phone that costs $1079 outright.  The phone will be cheaper through retailers with 5% off gift card deals etc if you look around. However, you're right, vodas sim only plans suck. You are only locked in for 36 months.\u000a12 months. Return phone, pay $149 and resign for another 24 months. Rinse repeat.. That is until something happens And you can't return the phone at month 12 then they have gotten 36 months out of you. New phone every year is bad economics no matter how you look at it\u000aThe get $149 plus your old phone with a resale value of around 400-500 (I'm low balling it's prob more) you have effectively paid an early upgrade fee of $649 to resign for another two years. Sim only you don't have a plan and you can sell the old phone and pocket the cash yourself. iPhone 7 256GB\u000a$60 Red Plan (4GB): $38 handset, $92 total monthly cost Shouldn't the above say $98 total? Yep, you're spot on, ta. Fixed! It was a lot of numbers. Did the maths also.\u000aCurrently paying $47/ mth for Sim only plan getting 9 GB data per month.\u000aAssume I choose the closest plan...\u000a$80 Red Plan (9GB): $12 handset, $92 total monthly cost 92-47 = 45\u000a45*24=$1080\u000aOutright phone = $1079 I save a whole dollar and own my phone outright, unlocked. afaik phones on plans have been unlocked since about 2013 And you get the flexibility to change provider or plan whenever you like. Gone are the days when your phone would be almost half price on a plan! Just a smidge out of my price range, then. It'll be interesting to see where the 6S and the 6S Plus land on contract pricing once the 7 and 7 Plus are out. Weren't the 6 and 6 Plus more than the 6s and 6s plus? Not that anyone had stock of them of course because that's not Apple's business model. Given its taken until now for the 6 to drop in price I doubt the 6s will drop very far on a plan. Hmmm, say on $70 Plan + $17 Phone per month, you are paying $2088 in 24 months. The RRP for the iPhone 7 32GB is ~$1100. So you are paying $1000 in 24 months for Unlimited Calls & SMS (which telco even charges for this stuff anymore) and 6GB of 4G data. So you are paying $40 per month for the service. Yes, it's not as lucrative as back in the days of $55-60 per month for flagships in the S3/S4 and iPhone 4S/5 era.  However, you are still usually covered by basic damage cover, you get looked after well and now, recently announced, you can upgrade every 12 months for $149 provided you give your phone back. I reckon, its still better value in the long run. You're paying slightly more than $20 per week, which lets be honest, is a great value and not a significant amount of your wage (30-60 mins of your work time per week is spent for that). Yes, rent and other bills can be hefty, but $20 per week for something that is very valuable (a mobile smart phone that holds all our data like personal info, banking and makes calls/mobile data which is very important today etc) is still pretty good value. Now, to find a job.... :D For once base level iPhone pricing doesn't make me roll my eyes, because they finally dropped the 16gb! I stream most of my music these days, I could totally live with 32gb, but 16gb non expandable isn't something I feel anyone is capable of. Any Idea if Optus/ Telstra will release their pricing before pre orders start tonight?

VIsabelle Dinoire, the woman who received the world\u2019s first partial face transplant with a new nose, chin and mouth, has passed away.\u000a\u000aImage: AP Dinoire suffered catastrophic injuries to her face in May 2005 after her Labrador attacked her while she was sleeping. Less than a year later, she received a partial face transplant \u2014 the world\u2019s first and a procedure that drew international attention and acclaim. The surgeons declared it a success but Dinoire struggled over the years as her body never fully accepted the new nose, chin and mouth, which came from a donor. Dinoire had been taking powerful immunosuppressant drugs for years, but she became ill last summer after her body rejected a new skin graft, causing her to lose some function in her lips. What\u2019s more, the anti-rejection treatments appeared to have triggered two different cancers. She died on 22 April 2016 at the age of 49, but her death was only announced by the hospital in Amiens, France, earlier today. It\u2019s not entirely clear why it took hospital officials so long to make the news public. Dinoire\u2019s death is a significant setback in the effort to help people who have lost portions of their face to disease or injury. Some critics contend that such \u201cnon-elective\u201d surgeries are wasteful and dangerous. \u201cFrom the day of the operation I have a face like everyone else,\u201d said Dinoire after her operation. \u201cI can open my mouth and eat. Recently, I feel my lips, my nose and my mouth.\u201d Undoubtedly, Dinoire\u2019s death won\u2019t come in vain. It\u2019s through pioneering work like this \u2014 and those who are brave enough to be on the receiving end \u2014 that progress is made in the medical sciences. [The Local, Mirror] A Labrador?? Really? They are the most well natured dogs I have ever seen. I looked it up and there are a lot of entries for labradors attacking people. It's a dog and like any animal you have the odd one that has behavioral issues I guess. Sure, but while she was asleep?  That's just weird especially for a Lab. Not at all. People place far too much imaginary importance on the temperament of breeds. Have you ever owned a Lab? Yes. And he was a vicious cunt of a dog. Always killing anything that came near the yard. Had him from a puppy. He just had blood lust.  Easily would have eaten a baby given the chance. I guess more to the point, have you owned more than 5-10 labs? Imagine if 1% of labs had behavioural issues - or even 0.1%. You may never meet one of these. It's like many rare things I guess. One reason you see lots of labs mentioned in attacks is because there are a huge number of them. Proportionately though, they're nowhere near as bad as a lot of other dogs. Was trying to find the original article I read but couldn't, this one is similar. You'll notice Labs don't even make it onto the list. http://www.thedailybeast.com/galleries/2010/10/29/dangerous-dogs.html Interestingly enough some of the most aggressive dogs (ie: the most likely to attack you) aren't ones you'd expect. Again, labs aren't on the list. https://pethelpful.com/dogs/10-Most-Aggressive-Dog-Breeds-Temperament-Ratings-and-Information Yeah, the most dangerous thing about Labs is their tail.  Maybe she had some tasty food all over her face, Labs will eat 'till they explode. ;) Apparently she overdosed on sleeping pills. The dog may have reacted to the situation more than just being generally violent. weirder still;\u000a"woops i've accidentally killed myself"\u000a"Woof  woof woof "\u000a"cheers"... "Dinoire's daughter reported that the family is sure that the dog, which was euthanized, mutilated Dinoire by accident. They believe that the damage was caused when the dog, finding Dinoire wouldn't wake up, got more and more frantic, and began scratching and clawing her."\u000a-According to wiki, quoting a Sun article no longer available. It was only hurting her out of love?\u000aYeah... a bit of anthropomorphising going on there. :( I find that easier to believe than her labrador mauling her - dogs don't usually maul their sleeping owners. And some people believe in homoeopathy. Considering the recent discoveries about how dogs brain function is very similar to humans it's not so far fetched. Years ago we had a cattledog staffy cross and he knew when anyone in the family was sick. He was normally boisterous but if someone was sick he'd be really quiet and gentle and lay with them. Just because they're not human doesn't mean they don't understand (to some degree) what is going on. I used to have a copy of the American Veterinary Encyclopaedia circa 1984 and it listed golden retrievers at top of the dog attack list, labs second followed by collies.  Right at the bottom was dobermans and Alsatians.     No reasons were given but I suspect the innocuous demeanor of the top 2 led people to develop a false sense of security .. especially with kids .. while people were extremely cautious around the 'attack' dogs.     Another factor is like with toy breeds, people tend not to train them, in the case of toys it's worse as they treat the dog like it is the pack leader  and get all surprised when they turn into yappy undisciplined feral little sheets.

V\u201cHow dare you treat me this way!\u201d boomed a husky voice with a thick Eastern European accent. \u201cI\u2019m king of the Puerto Ricans,\u201d came the roar from the packed waiting room.\u000a\u000aBethlem Royal Hospital (\u201cBedlam\u201d) as depicted in a scene from William Hogarth\u2019s series, \u201cThe Rake\u2019s Progress\u201d (1735). Public domain. The following is \u201cKing of the Puerto Ricans\u201d, an excerpt from Bedlam\u2019s Door: True Tales of Madness and Hope by Mark Rubinstein, MD. You can read an interview with the author here. It was a warm, humid June evening, about eight p.m. Although I\u2019d been a resident for only a few months, my instincts told me this would be one of those nights when the emergency room would earn its moniker as Bedlam\u2019s Door, a revolving carousel of psychosis, with one disturbed person after another being steered to the facility by the police, family members, or friends. \u201cKing of the Puerto Ricans,\u201d bellowed the man, his voice reverberating through the corridor. The claim was utterly absurd \u2014 from his self-proclaimed royalty to his non-Hispanic accent. It was bizarre, even for the environs of Manhattan Hospital\u2019s emergency room. Another leonine roar of Slavic-sounding speech brought me to my feet. Peering into the reception area, I saw a burly man bound securely to the confines of a high-backed wooden wheelchair. Despite his raging, the man \u2014 appearing to be in his sixties \u2014 had a cherubic-looking face, with round, rosy cheeks and bushy, dark eyebrows. A huge mane of white hair crowned his head. Highly agitated, he struggled against the canvas straps binding him to the wheelchair. Though his ankles were secured to the contraption\u2019s front rigging, he managed to kick and stomp his feet on the footrest. \u201cLet me go. I have work to do,\u201d he roared. His words were barely comprehensible, partly due to his agitation, but also because he lapsed into a foreign language \u2014 perhaps Polish, or some other Slavic-sounding tongue. He shook the wheelchair violently, attempting to break free. A woman wearing a drab housedress tried to quiet him, but he kept shouting. A police officer I knew saw me and approached. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Officer Romano?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe was running down Delancey Street, tossing trash baskets and shouting. We couldn\u2019t control him. He\u2019s as strong as an ox. You hear what he\u2019s yelling?\u201d Romano shook his head. Over the years, he\u2019d brought his share of patients to our doors, but this one clearly perplexed him. That week I\u2019d already encountered the putative son of God, an enraged Moses, and Satan himself. But I never imagined meeting the king of the Puerto Ricans. \u201cWho\u2019s the woman?\u201d I asked. \u201cHis wife. She said his name\u2019s Nathan . . . Nathan B.\u201d \u201cAny previous history you know of?\u201d I asked. \u201cNope. The neighbours say he\u2019s always been a quiet guy and a hard worker. A carpenter.\u201d A carpenter? Why doesn\u2019t he think he\u2019s Jesus?  Romano looked at me with raised eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna give us trouble with this one, are you, Doc?\u201d He knew I\u2019d sent the police packing scores of times with drunken and disorderly miscreants they dragged to the emergency room, trying to avoid tossing them into the precinct\u2019s drying-out tank. The cops hated babysitting drunks almost as much as they loathed the paperwork involved. But Nathan B. was a man lost in the throes of madness. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re safe on this one, but let me talk to his wife.\u201d Mark Rubinstein Sarah B.\u2019s pale face sagged. Her grey hair was tied back in a bun. She dabbed at her reddened eyes with a handkerchief. In the housedress, she looked like a Russian or Polish peasant woman from a bygone era. \u201cMrs. B., how did this start?\u201d \u201cIt was maybe two weeks ago, Doctor,\u201d she said with a thick accent. \u201cAfter Nathan hurt his back.\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a carpenter and was working on the roof of a house. He fell down onto a pile of wood. He\u2019s lucky to be alive,\u201d she said, again dabbing at her eyes. \u201cHe broke a bone in his back, and now he can\u2019t work. Maybe never . . . Only if it heals, the doctors said. And they don\u2019t know \u2014 a man his age. He\u2019s sixty-four. And, all he knows is work.\u201d \u201cWhat happened after the accident?\u201d \u201cAfter he got out of the hospital, he was very quiet. He talked to no one \u2014 not even me. He just looked out the window. He wasn\u2019t my Nathan anymore.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cHe seemed so sad, so depressed,\u201d she said, brushing away a tear. \u201cDid he ever have an episode like this before?\u201d I asked, wondering if Nathan B. might be suffering from bipolar disorder. \u201cNo. Never. But after he got hurt, he began talking to himself \u2014 strange words. And then came dreams, terrible dreams. He would cry out in his sleep. And when he woke up, he would shake and be covered in sweat. He was so wet, I had to change the sheets. He would pace all night, like a wild beast. And talking to himself \u2014 under his breath, in Hungarian. I tell you, Doctor, we never talk in that language . . . only English. \u201cI asked him, \u2018Nathan, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 and he said, \u2018I have nightmares.\u2019 But he would tell me nothing more. He said, \u2018Sarah, you would not want to know.\u2019 \u201cIt got worse. He would never leave the house.\u201d Her lips trembled. \u201cWhen he heard sirens, he shook. He thought they were coming for him.\u201d \u201cThe police?\u201d \u201cYes. He said, \u2018They\u2019re coming for me.'\u201d \u201cDid he tell you why?\u201d \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t say. He never did a thing wrong in his life.\u201d Tears spilled from her eyes. \u201cI know it\u2019s from his life in Europe.\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, fairly certain of the events to which she was referring. \u201cThe Nazis,\u201d she murmured, as her hands went to her face and she sobbed. \u201cMrs. B., where are you from originally?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re from Hungary.\u201d \u201cWhen did you come to the United States?\u201d \u201cWe came in 1947, after the war.\u201d \u201cWhere were you during the war?\u201d \u201cNathan lived through Auschwitz. But he never talks about it.\u201d \u201cAnd what about you? Were you in the camps?\u201d \u201cNo. I lived with a family on a farm. And I met Nathan after liberation.\u201d \u201cIn a displaced persons camp?\u201d She nodded. \u201cAnd we came here. We made a good life together.\u201d When Nathan was wheeled into the office, his eyes bulged and his face shone with sweat. His shirt was soaked with perspiration. He was restless and his eyes darted from the walls to the ceiling. I introduced myself, saying, \u201cI\u2019d like to talk with you.\u201d No response. He seemed lost in some inner world. He wore work pants, heavy boots, and a short-sleeved work shirt. His chest was broad and powerful-looking. His hands, large and roughly calloused, were those of a man who\u2019d done carpentry all his life. His forearms, strapped to the wheelchair\u2019s armrests, looked as though cables were bundled within them. A series of blue-black numbers was tattooed on his left forearm \u2014 a remnant of Auschwitz. \u201cMr. B.?\u201d \u201cHow can you do this?\u201d he growled. Suddenly, his eyes crawled over me. Spittle formed at the corners of his mouth. \u201cDo what?\u201d \u201cHow dare you tie up a king!\u201d he shouted hoarsely. \u201cHow did you become king?\u201d \u201cGod made me king. Do you question his word?\u201d His chin quivered. I said nothing. \u201cAnswer me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cDo you question God\u2019s word?\u201d He trembled so intensely, the wheelchair shook. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t question God or his word,\u201d I said. \u201cBut why king of the Puerto Ricans?\u201d \u201cSuch a poor people . . . and persecuted. They must go to their own land.\u201d His eyes roamed about the office once again. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re at Manhattan Hospital.\u201d \u201cWhat am I doing here? I\u2019m not crazy.\u201d \u201cYou were running down the street, throwing trash cans . . .\u201d \u201cI was calling my people . . . my subjects.\u201d \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d \u201cWe must leave before the SS gets here.\u201d \u201cWhat makes you think they\u2019re coming?\u201d His face tightened, and sweat dribbled from his hairline. \u201cCan\u2019t you see? There\u2019s no time left.\u201d \u201cBefore what happens?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll be taken away . . . to the camps. They want to kill all of us.\u201d \u201cKill who?\u201d \u201cMy people. All the Puerto Rican people. It will be a holocaust.\u201d \u201cWhy now?\u201d \u201cThe time has come.\u201d His eyeballs rolled upward and he fixed his stare at the ceiling. He began muttering a goulash of English, German, and Hungarian. Nathan B.\u2019s mane of white hair, coupled with his upward gaze, reminded me of Renaissance paintings depicting ancient prophets \u2014 maybe something by Caravaggio \u2014 painted in dusky colours with ethereal light radiating from some godly presence. \u201cMr. B., I understand you began feeling bad a few weeks ago . . .\u201d His garbled muttering continued. He was lost in a world of messianic revelation. The extent to which deluded thinking could seize a person never failed to amaze me. I tried again to get him to talk. \u201cI\u2019m king of the Puerto Ricans\u201d was all he would say in English. \u201cMr. B., I\u2019m going to admit you to the hospital,\u201d I finally said. His incantations stopped. He turned to me, his eyes burning with pious fury. \u201cYou want to make me a slave, so I will work for you.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t be a slave,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be here until you calm down.\u201d \u201cYou Nazi. God will make you pay for this.\u201d I\u2019d tapped into his past \u2014 and the source of his madness. \u201cKing of the Puerto Ricans,\u201d excerpted from Bedlam\u2019s Door: True Tales of Madness and Hope by Mark Rubinstein, MD (Thunder Lake Press). © Mark Rubinstein.

VApple has taken the courageous step to rid us all of the archaic headphone jack, and usher in a new future of lightning enabled audio in its new iPhone 7 range. \u201cBut how will I charge my phone and listen to music at the same time?\u201d I hear you cry.  Why, with this $60 Belkin adapter, of course. It is has been given the thumbs up from Apple, after all.   So what do you get for the price? The Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar (because it is, indeed, a rockstar for solving this problem that never existed before) supports pass-through charging up to 12W for iPhone and iPad, up to 48 kHz, 24-bit audio output and is compatible with both the Lightning Audio headphones and the Apple Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter. But that\u2019s not all! It supports remote control and microphone from Lightning Audio headphones and it works with Apple iPhone 7 Smart Battery case. All for the low, low price of $59.99. Worth it? You be the judge.  "Courageous" my ass. The pricing of the new EarPods is courageous. The pricing of this new dongle is equally courageous. This is a typical Apple move to maximise profits by solving a problem that nobody had, and seeking to sell new, overpriced headphones to the clueless masses that think Apple is the cutting edge of tech. My guess is that the AirPods will be just good enough to not make people complain about the quality (much) and we can all expect new models of "W1-equipped" Beats headphones to start popping up soon for the bargain price of $300, with breathless reviews by the Apple faithfully pronouncing them to be "much better than the AirPods."  That strategy should maximise their profits in the short term, while ensuring that people will have one more thing keeping them inside the Apple fold in the longer term, since their new expensive Beats headphones probably won't work with other non-Apple devices. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 8:59 am								 Come now, Klaw. It's clear #courage was behind this move. If you don't believe that genuine courage is behind it, why is it in your article. If you're using it ironically or sarcastically, it's not working. Side note: Why do people use hashtags in this setting? You don't need to use a hashtag to indicate what you're trying to say, because words already do that. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 9:03 am								 Dude, chill out. The article is dripping with sarcasm which you obviously didn't get with several #s #virality #is #king #in #a #consumerist #society This is a revolution, Klaw. A revolution, I tell you. Aren't you moved by the bravery? The #courage? I barely slept from the joy, I wept.  Apple really is being the change it wants to see in the world. Woops... posted in the wrong place before. But anyway: #funatparties You need a Snickers Klaw The use of the the word was written satirically in the article:\u000a"Apple has taken the courageous step to rid us all of the archaic headphone jack" = satire\u000a"All for the low, low price of $59.99." = satire *whoosh* Personally I have been using wireless charging and wireless headphones for about 4 years.  This is all a bit old hat.  I look forward to a boom in new bluetooth headphones.   I'd be happy to get rid of every single hole on the phone and make it rock solid. Wireless is no doubt the future, but I don't think it's a good business decision.  Apple users are typically not tech savvy folk or early adopters in my opinion. Personally the only time I use bluetooth headphones is when I'm at the gym, or on my motorbike or in the car (my head unit is on an overhead console, so having a wire running all the way down from the roof is just annoying.) The rest of the time, I'm using wired headphones exclusively, because they sound better, I don't need to fret about charging them when I'm out and about, saves on phone battery life, and I like in-ear earphones, the bluetooth versions of which are all universally terrible in the battery life department. So now because Apple has decided to remove the audio jack for no particular reason if I want to listen with my headphones at the same time as the phone charges (something I do every night) I need 2 adapters!!!!!!! how is this an advantage to consumers? Who said consumers would be better off ;)? Ah look - an Android user in it's natural "Everything Apple does is bad" environment :) Yes that was a joke - sarcasm not necessarily so easy to see in text :) *wipes away tear, brings closer for hug*  #courage What a decidedly inelegant solution to a problem that is frankly self-inflicted. I know people are saying "Then just don't buy the new iPhone", and right now that's fine, but in a year, or two years, when all the iPhones are like this? Why shouldn't we complain about something we don't like? We owe nothing to Apple, especially not any good will. They weren't first to get rid of the headphone jack and I didn't see anyone else whinge at the Android devices running exclusively type-c connectors. I doubt this issue is as much about the connector as it about laying on to the topical topic of the week or general Apple hate. The main reason for the lack of outcry is that the few Android devices (Moto Z) that have dropped the headphone jack are niche devices, and we have a veritable cornucopia of alternative devices to choose from. I suspect that the lack of headphone port will turn quite a number of people away from those models and their sales numbers will be poor. I wasn't even talking about flagships like the Moto Z, I was referring to the baseline cheap devices that come from ZTE, Huawei, and the like. Actually, I was due a new phone when the Moto Z was being released, and the idea of those mods was really intriguing to me. I was actually planning on making that my next phone, until it came to light there was no headphone jack, which immediately struck it off my potential phones list. That was what ultimately swayed my decision, and a LOT of other people. There was a lot of complaining when the Moto Z came with not headphone jack, but since it's android I assume you just either ignored it or didn't notice. But now that it's APPLE on the receiving end, suddenly it's such a big deal that people don't like it. I didn't see anyone else whinge at the Android devices running exclusively type-c connectors. You weren't looking very hard then. I particularly liked how every photo in that review had the headphone dongle plugged in :-) One only hopes they do the same for their iPhone 7 review. To be fair though, there were worse problems with the Moto Z, like its huge price hike and new lack of any ongoing support, which meant nobody was going to buy it anyway. So the headphone jack was overshadowed by even bigger complaints. $60... To charge and listen to music... That's Belkin for ya. I like their products but holy shit I feel gouged whenever I buy them at full price. Whats worse is I've had belkin lightning cables fail pretty quickly, making me wonder if the money saved over apple products is worth the shorter lifespan :/ Ouch. I noticed my 2 metre Belkin cable is starting to wear on the plug since it doesn't offer a snug fit into my phone any more yet the apple lightning cable is fine. I paid $30+ for the damn thing when I got my iPod, I've gotten more life from cheap cables from Kogan, which is kinda sad. Which is tragic cause I cant remember the last time Ive had a USB cable go on me :/ x2 on this, very quickly fray. They're not very securely anchored. I am honestly shocked at how many people listen to music through corded headphones while their phone is on charge. It seems like after the keynote yesterday a million people all came forward and confessed to one specific use case. I charge my phone while I sleep. Also I'm sure there will be accessories available cheaper than this one. Bel kin aren't the cheapest for stuff. Well the other much bigger issue people have raised is that headphone sockets can break, especially if you do a lot of walking with the phone in your pocket. (I've never broken mine) That's fine if it's the 3.5mm headphone jack that breaks - you can get wireless headphones. But if the lightning port breaks, you can't charge the phone. They don't have wireless charging. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 10:51 am								 And this may well be the iphone 7s achilles heal. If enough lightning ports fail due to it's inability to cope with the stresses of headphone use, it's going to cost apple big time. Or, possibly, it's been so ubiquitous that until it suddenly changed, nobody talked about it? Personally, I don't talk to anyone about how I charge my phone and listen to music at the same time. But the absence of it suddenly makes it a talking point. Or, possibly, it's been so ubiquitous that until it suddenly changed, nobody talked about it?  That's certainly possible. I guess we'll never know. Unless the iPhone 7 is a huge flop because so many people absolutely must have a phone that enables them to use corded headphones while also charging their device. Sales is the wrong metric to use to judge of a feature is needed or not. People buy iPhones regardless and Apple hide bad sales figures of they don't What metric do you suggest? Tweets are hardly meaningful #funatparties Why not replace the old headphone socket with an additional lightning port?  The phone didn't get any smaller, the bezels are still ridiculous, and it has less functionality than before (2 ports down to 1). This adapter is an ok solution to a problem that shouldn't exist. A second lightning port could mean easy music+charging, but also could allow for additional functionality like plugging in to a monitor etc.  If there was something to show for the reduction of ports then fine but there isn't. What, and have more ports than their MacBook Air? :-) Yeah that needs more too! We need more ports dammit! I couldn't imagine getting by with one port on my laptop, I usually have a mouse, flash drive, hard drive, headphones and charger plugged in, also HDMI to my TV when I'm home! Sure there's multi adapters but that's more bulk to lug around! \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 1:11 pm								 well what's $60 on a #1200 phone.../sarcasm I always thought it was good safety practice not to plug yourself into a power socket via electrical socket-charger-smartphone-earphone jack... isn't that how electrocution incidents happen if there is a power surge? \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 11:18 am								 Come on, let's be serious here. Why would anybody be worried about electrocution when they're using a Lightning cable? It's not like the name conjures any kind of imagery. I support ditching the 3.5mm plug in many ways.  IMO the true problem is that Apple is fragmenting the market (USB-C vs Lightning) - though arguably this is an advantage to them.  I say ditch 3.5mm, and put two USB-C sockets on every device. Problem solved. Phone --> Lightning splitter\u000aLightning splitter A --> Charge cable\u000aLightning splitter B --> Lightning to 3.5mm converter --> 3.5mm headjack ..... all in your pocket at once.... LOL. You charge in your pocket? I've seen the pokemon go crowd walking round with those huge 12,000mah charging devices in their pockets! I don't really care about charging.  What I care about is going from one device to another.  My 3.5mm headphones I frequently swap between my work notebook and my phone - I just unplug them from one, and back into the other.  My experience with BT is that it's rather painful to mess with pairing like this. Then my phone - I deliberately park 2km from the office where I work.  It means I'm not battling with everyone to get a parking spot and I get a bit of exercise.  My phone tethers to my car automatically when I'm in it.  Is it easy to swap the tether to my BT headphones when I get out and back when I return again? Honestly, I don't know if it will be a problem, I'm just irritated that it's a change no-one really asked for, doesn't seem all that progressive and suits Apple more than their users.  It means I have several hundred dollars worth of Bose headphones that will require me to use a dongle until I decide to replace them, and the replacements will not sound as good, need to be recharged and won't change devices as easily. The explanations that Apple provided for the 'initiative' at the launch this week were pretty pathetic too. form over function. design over practicality.\u000aso u need to spend more and buy a  third party device for what? bad design. pass Dongles. Because everything old is new again. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 1:57 pm								 http://appleplugs.com/

VIt\u2019s still hard to imagine that a humongous series like Doctor Who still has so many episodes missing from its archives \u2014 let alone entire stories missing, especially ones as important as Power of the Daleks. Good news though: The BBC is reviving the serial as a special animated release.\u000a\u000aAnnounced today to mark 50 years since it first aired, the complete animated reconstruction of Power of the Daleks \u2014 hugely important to fans as it is the first story to feature Patrick Troughton as the second Doctor, marking a major milestone in the show\u2019s history \u2014 will be available digitally through the BBC store starting November 5. One episode will be released a day for six days, before being made available in a wider capacity from other digital retailers on November 14, and on DVD in the UK November 21.  The BBC of the 1960s is very different to the organisation it is today \u2014 film reels weren\u2019t kept for archival purposes outside of certain scenarios, but instead junked to make space for potentially more lucrative recordings. This lead to the complete loss of episodes from dozens of iconic British TV shows, but the loss most keenly felt today is those of dozens of episodes from the earliest period of Doctor Who\u2018s history. A total of 97 episodes across a plethora of serials (back in Doctor Who\u2018s earliest days, all stories had multiple episodes in them \u2014 often four, five or six) are still missing. In a case largely unique to Doctor Who, all 97 survive as audio recordings taken by fans on broadcast. In some cases, these have been officially released as image galleries \u2014 surviving publicity stills presented with the intact audio recordings, or in some special cases, such as The Tenth Planet or The Ice Warriors, where only certain episodes are missing, they\u2019re remastered with new, animated footage to fill the gaps, accompanied by the original audio. Power of the Daleks will mark the first time that the BBC has animated an entire serial for public release. There\u2019s nothing currently announced yet in terms of an Australian release on DVD, however presumably the serial will be available from other digital retailers starting November 14 outside of the UK as well. BBC America for instance has confirmed it will broadcast the entire story on Saturday, November 12, and make it available for streaming from their site the day after. If you\u2019re in the UK, you can sign up here to get access to the first episode on November 5, 5:50PM local time \u2014 50 years to the minute it first aired.

VWith only a few days left before it\u2019s scheduled to crash-land on the surface of Comet 67P, the Rosetta spacecraft is still yielding amazing discoveries. And I\u2019m not just talking about lost comet landers.\u000a Meet Kenneth and Juliette, possibly some distant relatives of yours. Image: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for COSIMA Team Scientists now report that Rosetta detected complex organic molecules in the dust surrounding its comet. This strengthens the argument that the building blocks of life itself may have come from icy space rocks. Complex organic molecules \u2014 mixtures of mostly carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen that form the basis of our biology \u2014 have been hinted at on comets before, most notably during fast flybys of Halley\u2019s comet. But Rosetta is the first mission to actually catch dusty organic particles escaping the surface of such a body, affording scientists a detailed look at their composition. Two of those dust grains, curiously nicknamed Kenneth and Juliette, are the subject of a scientific paper published this week in Nature. Captured in May and October of 2015 and analysed with Rosetta\u2019s on-board mass spectrometer, each of these wee grains contains carbon-based molecules bound together in very large structures, similar to the organic matter found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites here on Earth. \u201cOur analysis reveals carbon in a far more complex form than expected,\u201d Hervé Cottin, a co-author on the new study, said in a statement. \u201cIt is so complex, we can\u2019t give it a proper formula or a name!\u201d Comparison of the spectra determined for Kenneth and Juliette with the composition of organic matter in a chondritic meteorite found on Earth. Red lines indicate cometary dust grains while black lines indicate the meteorite. Image: ESA/Rosetta/MPS for COSIMA Team The finding is significant for a few reasons. For one, it builds off early discoveries made by the Philae lander in the hours before its batteries went dead on Comet 67P\u2019s surface. While Philae only sniffed very light, gaseous organic compounds known as volatiles, the new analysis focused on large, solid particles, which indicate more complex organic chemistry. Second, scientists have long debated whether the organics found in meteorite samples come from space, or whether these rocks were contaminated after crash-landing on a biological planet. The discovery of similar molecules in space itself strengthens the argument that the carbon-based stuff we see in meteorites came from beyond Earth. Finally, Rosetta\u2019s discovery offers a tantalising glimpse of what\u2019s to come from NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission. A first-of-its kind attempt to grab a scoop of dirt from a space rock and bring it back to Earth for analysis, OSIRIS-REx is expected to give us a detailed look at the makeup of the rogue bodies buzzing our planet\u2019s backyard. That mission launches today, by the way \u2014 so even as we say goodbye to Rosetta, expect plenty more on whether all of the Kenneths and Juliettes out there are your distant ancestors in the years ahead. [Rosetta Blogs] I have a question for any cosmologers out there. My understanding: At least one star went nova, and our sun and solar system accreted out of the resulting dust by virtue of electrostatics and gravitation. My question:\u000aBy what mechanisms were the elements and compounds sorted? To put it another way:\u000aHow did so much of the hydrogen end up in the middle (the sun).\u000aHow did so much carbon and oxygen end up in the comets?\u000aHow are the inner planets so iron-rich, while the gas giants aren't? Thanks very much for any answer, or links to relevant lectures online. I guess the sun is the remnant of the previous star, so it is composed of H and He. All the denser elements gravitated towards the centre, i.e. closer to the sun, while all the less dense elements went out further. My understanding is that the stable remnant of a nova may be many things, but is never a main-sequence star. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 1:00 pm								 Now Bringer, I love astronomy/chemistry, however, I don't work in the field (amateur). I can answer a couple of these. I'm not sure about why comets are made mainly from water and carbon, its a good question, I know they are left over crap from solar system formation but why,  those elements, not sure. Why is there so much hydrogen in the sun (center of the solar system).\u000aThis has to do with the way hydrogen and helium formed way back when the big bang occurred. The universe is made "predominantly" of around 92% hydrogen, 8% helium. These elements are the most common because of the way the universe cooled not long after the bang. You need heat to make heavier elements, (carbon, iron etc) Hydrogen and Helium as we know are the simplest forms. As the universe cooled, protons formed, the simplest form of matter. When combined with one electron, you get hydrogen. When the early universe was still really hot, some of that hydrogen fused to helium, but most of it remained as hydrogen. By the time the helium was created, the universe wasn't hot enough to form anything heavier down the line, like carbon. So, now we move on a little, and gravity starts to kick into gear. So we start forming nice big clouds, known as molecular clouds, made of, you guessed it, mainly hydrogen and helium. Stars spend most of their life in whats known as "Main Sequence", through nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. So what about the heavier elements, well, they come from the stars during this fusion process. So we have The Big Bang, maker of Hydrogen and Helium. (and yes a little lithium, beryllium and boron). Then we have the stars themselves (supernova etc), makers of Carbon, Iron etc etc. So why is there so much Hydrogen in the middle, well the best answer is, if there wasn't, the sun wouldn't have even formed.  How are the inner planets so iron-rich, while the gas giants aren't?\u000aFunnily enough we aren't 100% certain about gas giants cores. We still aren't clear on what lies at the cores of Jupiter or Saturn (nor the ice giants Neptune, Uranus). We still don't know enough about accretion disks and stellar system formation to say for certain. We know our sun is very typical, but we do think that our system formed from a very heavy element rich area, as there is actually a little too much gold, uranium etc to come from supernova alone, meaning the cloud that we formed from was a little bit of an anomaly. (again more study needed)  This is one of the things the Juno mission hopes to find at Jupiter. (whats in its core)  Sorry I ran mainly of memory there, but there are many great articles etc online. Cheers Dear BOM, I'm now home and Ive had a bourbon (or two) and your question regarding the "why" of comets chemical makeup intrigued me.\u000aThere are basically two types of Comets. The solar system, actually extends extremely far out past poor little "demoted" Pluto. We have the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud. The Oort cloud is much further out from the Kuiper belt (theres a great shot in the opening sequence to the movie Contact which shows these two very well... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwhQB3TKXA). Some comets formed in the Oort, some in the Kuiper (Pluto is actually in the inner edge of the Kuiper belt) a theory suggests that these (the Kuiper and Oort) used to be much closer to the sun during the the planetary formation phase, and the planets gravity had a lot to do with what got kept in and what got chucked out so to speak. Basically, the reason for the "ice" obviously has to do with temperature. As this left over debris of planetary formation lies far from the sun its cold. The gas outbursts observed usually show, fragment molecules of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, as we know, the most abundant elements in space. So the chemical makeup of comets may just be because they are most common frozen gas element's in those cold outer regions. If there are any Astrophysicists around, please lend a hand. Time for one more little bourbon.\u000aCheers So, I've incorporated your observations into my mental model and concluded that the elements weren't "sorted", they were "culled"! My new mental model:\u000a1: The elements were spatially evenly distributed in the space where our system formed.  They clumped into big-ass lumps through electrostatics and gravitation and collisions.  The biggest lump achieved ignition mass. 2: Once the sun ignited, volatiles started boiling off any orbiting entities and escaping.  The closer the entity, the faster it lost its volatiles.  As you get sufficiently distant to reach the ice point of a given volatile, the planet gets to keep that volatile. 3: The comets get to keep carbon because CO2 makes dry ice.  Chemistry happens on eccentric comets each time they make a pass. I'm now a bit struck by the similarity between Darwin's "tidal pool", and eccentric comets. Sounds good to me.\u000aEven spatial distribution of elements in the universe "appears" to be true so far. The second law of thermodynamics says that the total entropy of the universe can never decrease. Say I make a big box and I put 100 oxygen molecules inside (and we can somehow see them). Over time, the molecules will spread out (thru Newton mechanics and electromagnetism) until they are randomly distributed. We know that when the universe first started (point of big bang) there was zero entropy, but as it cools down it will eventually, if it survives long enough, end in "heat death". (Equilibrium of matter and the highest entropy)\u000aJust to note, those volatiles can have cool exceptions. Take Earth and Mars for eg. Mars (further from the sun than earth) lost all its surface water, Earth didn't. Other forces can be at play that stop this, magnetic fields on Earth helped save its water, we still aren't 100% sure why Mars lost its water, many theories.\u000aSorry, Im an electronics engineer, and not huge on biology, but I done a quick search on Darwin's tidal pool and can only assume you're referring to the lizard throwing? I never knew Darwin was a such a sadist ;) http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/discovering_planets_beyond/how-do-planets-form\u000ahttps://lcogt.net/spacebook/planets-and-how-they-formed/\u000ahttp://lasp.colorado.edu/education/outerplanets/solsys_planets.php Before anyone gets excited, organics only means it includes carbon atoms.

VYou probably don\u2019t think of running as a dangerous exercise, but it\u2019s an intense activity and injuries are common, especially for beginners who push themselves too hard. This graphic from Strength Running shows how you can prevent running injuries. Your body isn\u2019t a machine and you should never think you can just push through the pain. Trainer, marathoner, and occasional Lifehacker contributor Jason Fitzgerald shows us common running injuries that result from the repetitive stress you place on your body when exercising. You can prevent some of these injuries by adding some variety to your routine \u2014 different models of shoes, different terrain, etc. \u2014 as well as with strength training.

VIt took a little while for the apps to come into their own, but we\u2019re at a place now where the iPad has nearly as good of a selection of apps as the iPhone. Now, it\u2019s harder than ever to find apps that are worthwhile. Let us save you some time with this collection of the best iPad apps. The Lifehacker Pack is a yearly snapshot of our favorite, must-have applications for each of our favorite platforms. This list focuses specifically on apps that really shine on the iPad, so no half-done, blown up iPhone apps here. You wouldn\u2019t think it based solely on the name, but our pick for the best email client on iOS is Microsoft Outlook. It includes everything you need in an email client, including a unified inbox, customisable swipe options, powerful search, and a solid filtering system. It blows Apple\u2019s default Mail app out of the water, so if you\u2019re looking for something with more power, Outlook\u2019s the way to go. If you don\u2019t want to deal with Microsoft, Spark is the next logical choice, and a fantastic email app in its own right. It does everything Outlook does, but adds in a smart inbox that\u2019s much better than Outlook\u2019s, and a ton of customisation options to make the app your own. Picking a notes apps used to be easy, but things are a lot more complicated these days and you have tons of solid options. If you like a ton of features, blow for blow, OneNote and Evernote are the most comparable, offering you means to save images, integrate IFTTT, have tons of folders, special recipe filters, and tons of more options. The catch, really, is that OneNote\u2019s free, while Evernote\u2019s best features are locked behind a paywall. These everything buckets aren\u2019t for everyone though. If plain text is more your thing, Simplenote is the app for you. There\u2019s no long list of features here, Simplenote just does text, and it does it very well. If you\u2019re looking for something in-between, Google Keep is well worth a look. It\u2019s powerful, but still pretty simple. Of course, you\u2019ll get a lot more out of Google Keep if you\u2019re already invested in the Google ecosystem. Heck, it\u2019s also worth pointing out that Apple\u2019s default Notes app has made a lot of strides over the years, so if you haven\u2019t checked it out recently, give it a look. It fits somewhere in-between the everything buckets of Evernote and OneNote and Google Keep. For whatever reason, the iPad is pretty devoid of to-do apps, but thankfully, our favorite on iPhone, Any.Do arrived on iPad in the last year. Any.Do has a simple interface that makes it easy to add tasks and organise them, but you can also add tasks with your voice, share lists with other, sync across multiple devices, and even easily postpone tasks. Editing images on your iPad isn\u2019t ideal, but sometimes it\u2019s your only option. Pixelmator is a worthy app for doing it because it features just about every tool that the desktop version has. You can quickly jump in and start editing photos, painting, and doing basic graphic design. If you\u2019re editing photos on your iPad, Pixelmator is a must have. Using your iPad as a second display is a great way to extend your desktop without taking too much space. The best app for doing so is Duet Display. With it, you can connect your iPad to your computer with a cable, then immediately start using your iPad as a second display with almost no lag. It comes with lots of options too, including high resolution displays, 60 frames per second, and touch support. The iPad is a fantastic (albeit expensive) notepad, and depending on what you\u2019re looking for you have a couple options. As a sketchbook, Paper is a fantastic option that makes even the worst artist look like an artistic genius with it\u2019s brush options, easy to use book, and downloadable color palettes. While you\u2019re at it you might consider grabbing a solid stylus as well. You have tons of options for calendar apps on the iPad, but our favorite on iPhone is Fantastical 2, and that remains the case for the iPad as well because it\u2019s a perfect mesh of features and usability. Fantastical allows for natural language input, so you can type out \u201clunch tomorrow with Alan\u201d and Fantastical will automatically create the event. Beyond that, the app features a variety of view modes, a light and dark theme, Reminders integration, and a map view to get a visual look of your day. Writing on an iPad is great and you have a ton of quality apps to choose from to do it. That said, we like Editorial because it\u2019s incredibly customisable. The crux of Editorial is its automation functions, where you can set it up with text expansion, application triggers, and more. Basically, it\u2019s as powerful as you want it to be, but still works great for just writing. If longform writing is more your thing, Ulysses is our favorite. Ulysses sits somewhere between plain text and Scrivener, making it perfect for organising and writing that novel you\u2019ve been meaning to write without being overwhelming.  If you\u2019re a Chrome user on your desktop computer, Chrome\u2019s syncing features alone make it a stellar replacement for Safari. Chrome\u2019s packed with some extra great features, including a desktop view, a solid incognito mode, easy to browse tabs, and the speed dial to quickly access your favorite sites. If Chrome isn\u2019t your thing, you have a few other solid options as well. Safari\u2019s pretty solid these days, but if you\u2019re not also using it on a Mac, it\u2019s usefulness diminishes pretty quickly. The official Facebook app does a fine job of providing you with a solid mobile experience, but it\u2019s especially good looking on the iPad. With big pictures, a nice wide view of everything, and a full set of features, if you\u2019re using Facebook, the iPad app is well worth keeping around. Skype has long been the kind of video calling, but Google recently introduced Google Hangouts is giving it a run for its money. The reason is simple: pretty much everyone already has a Google account, and that\u2019s all your need to use Google Hangouts. The iPad version looks great on the bigger screen, and the added scree real estate makes video chat a lot better than the iPhone counterpart. With it, you can make video calls instantly, and it doesn\u2019t cost you a dime. That said, Skype is still the kind of VOIP, and it\u2019s widely used enough that most people have it. Both work great for video chats, so pick whichever suits you best. Dropbox is already a fantastic cloud storage service, but what really sets it above the competition is its mobile app. While it used to be nothing more than a file browser, nowadays you can instantly upload all your pictures, edit files, and easily share anything in your Dropbox through a wide variety of services. The PDF viewer alone is fantastic on the iPad, but overall it\u2019s an incredibly useful app to keep around. Plus, you can always score more space with a little work. Workflow is an app that allows you to create macros and small apps for iOS. Essentially, it\u2019s Automator for your iPad. You can make it so with a tap of a button you can load up upcoming calendar events, print a page to PDF, find lyrics for the currently playing song, and more. Launch Center Pro makes doing serious work on your iPad a lot easier by allowing you to create application specific shortcuts. Basically, you\u2019ll fire up Launch Center Pro, hit an action button, and you\u2019ll get whisked away to a specific part of an app so you can quickly send emails, create reminders, and whatever else. If This Then That is already one of our favorite web apps, and the iPad app is just as powerful. Not only can you create any recipe you want on the go, you can also tap directly into the iPad\u2019s contacts, photos, reminders, and more to automate whatever happens on your iPad. It\u2019s hard to really differentiate between any of the ereader apps on the iPad because they\u2019re all pretty similar. They all let you read books on your phone, and most of them are tied to an account on the the store they\u2019re part of. So, if you\u2019re using iBooks on another device, then that\u2019s the logical choice. The same goes for the Kindle app. Pick the ebook app that works best for you. That said, if you\u2019re a student, the Kindle app has all kinds of killer features. Google Reader might be dead, but Reeder is still our favorite RSS reader. With a recent update, Reeder added support for a few third-party RSS readers, including Feedly. Reeder is incredibly clean, and you can quickly save articles for later viewing, sync everything up, or just browse your feeds in its simple interface. Bookmarking services are great on the desktop, but they really excel on the iPad. Save articles wherever you find them, and you get access on your phone so you can read when you\u2019re bored. Each service has its own set of benefits and downsides, but they\u2019re all terrific and look fantastic on the iPad. So, pick one and run with it. Listening to podcasts on your iPad is a fantastic way to pass the time, but Apple\u2019s option is less than perfect. We\u2019re big fans of Overcast, because once you set it up it automates pretty much everything for you. It downloads all your podcasts directly in the app, it works over the air or Wi-Fi, or you can set it up so it only streams content. Overcast can also intelligently boost the sound on podcasts and has a \u201csmart speed\u201d option that speeds up your favorite podcasts without making them sound weird. It\u2019s also free, which makes it automatically appealing. No video player? Particularly that does not involve syncing? NPlayer is the bees knees for media playback.\u000aIt does H264, DTS, FLAC and it works on Windows networks seamlessly.\u000aMy iPad 3 will play 2070p DTS streamed over the network! And if you want to listen to the music that's synced to your phone (not streamed), Harken is a great alternative to the buillt-in music app. Good list, but cant agree with your "notes" selections.  The best notes app is Evernote, but its costly.  Apple Notes is way better than Google Keep, which is a very limited app, not up to Google's normal standard.  OneNote is really clunky.  If you need cross-platform, go Evernote, if you are a Mac user, go Apple Notes.  If you really want a Google notekeeping app, I believe there was a Lifehacker article on how to use Inbox for this purpose.

p930
VAs Members of the Climate Change Authority who have participated fully in the Special Review of Australia\u2019s Climate Goals and Policies, we reached the conclusion, after much consideration, that we could not in good conscience lend our names to its report, published last week. Rather than resign from the Authority we decided to write a minority report. Here we present edited extracts from our report, which is released today.  The basis of our disagreement with the majority report is its failure to recognise the importance of the constraint put on all future emissions-reduction targets and policies by Australia\u2019s carbon budget. The carbon budget is the total emissions that Australia can release between now and 2050 while still contributing its fair share in holding the global temperature rise to less than 2\u2103 \u2013 a key goal of the Paris climate agreement negotiated last December. The majority report should, but does not, address the relationship between its recommendations and Australia\u2019s carbon budget, consistent with a fair and equitable national contribution to the global carbon budget. This is all the more regrettable because the requirement to do so is embedded in the Special Review\u2019s terms of reference and was analysed in the First Report of the Special Review released in April 2015 (before the appointment of six new Members to the Authority in October 2015). In 2014 the Authority recommended an Australian emissions budget of 10.1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases for the period 2013-2050. On this basis, it advised that Australia should set an emissions-reduction trajectory for 2030 in the range of 45-65% below 2005 levels. Contrast that with the current 26-28% target set by the Abbott government. Against the constraints of the carbon budget, the majority report accepts \u2013 explicitly in some places, implicitly in others \u2013 the government\u2019s current target. But accepting this less ambitious target for 2030 is consistent neither with the Authority\u2019s own advice to government, nor with Australia\u2019s commitment under the Paris Agreement to play its role in holding warming below 2\u2103. The graph below shows the carbon budget for Australia put forward by the Climate Change Authority in its earlier report. (The budget is the area under the curve.) The embedded pie chart shows the sliver of emissions that would remain to cover the 20-year period after 2030 if there is no change from the 26-28% target. More than 90% of Australia\u2019s carbon budget to 2050 would be used up by 2030. Australia\u2019s emissions would have to decline precipitously and reach net zero by 2035. Such a dramatic reduction would be impossible to achieve. So the current target of 26-28% lacks credibility because it is wholly inconsistent with Australia\u2019s international obligations. If pursued it is likely to lead to a policy crisis within a decade or less. In our view, the failure of the majority report to make this clear to government and the public contravenes the Authority\u2019s legislated obligation to deliver independent advice and to recommend measures that are \u201cenvironmentally effective\u201d and based on science. We believe that the effect of the majority report will be to sanction further delay and a slow pace of action, with serious consequences for the nation. Those consequences include either very severe and costly emissions cuts in the mid-to-late 2020s, or alternatively a repudiation of Australia\u2019s international commitments, and free-riding on the efforts of the rest of the world. As we see it, the recommendations of the majority report are framed to suit a particular assessment of the prevailing political circumstances. We believe it is inappropriate and often counterproductive to attempt to second-guess political negotiations, especially for a new and uncertain parliament. The unduly narrow focus of the majority report, seemingly based on a reading from a political crystal ball, has ruled out policies, such as a strengthened renewables target and stronger land clearing restrictions, that have a proven capacity to respond most effectively to the nation\u2019s climate change goals. At the centre of the majority report\u2019s recommendations is the retention of the current Direct Action policy as the basis for further action. Its two pillars are the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) and its incorporated Safeguard Mechanism, which sets an upper limit on emissions from major polluters. The report also recommends a new emissions trading scheme for electricity generation, based on an emissions-intensity baseline. Such a scheme would have lower price rises than the kind of cap-and-trade scheme favoured everywhere else in the world, and which Australia would have now if not for the Abbott government. After the rancour that engulfed the carbon price, the intensity-based scheme is presumably seen as more appealing to nervous politicians. The majority report downplays the drawbacks of emissions-intensity schemes and the Safeguard Mechanism. There is not space to discuss them here, but we would like to comment on the flaws in the ERF because the majority report recommends that it be hugely expanded. Under an expanded ERF policy, the cost to the federal budget would increase sharply, and even more so if Australia adopted tougher emissions targets in line with the science. Using the ERF in this way would be, in Professor Ross Garnaut\u2019s words, \u201can immense drain on the budget\u201d. We believe it is unwise to make Australia\u2019s climate policy hostage to disputes over fiscal policy. As a rule, the replacement of the widely accepted \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principle with the ERF\u2019s \u201cpay the polluter\u201d principle is bad economics, bad ethics and bad policy. The practical drawbacks include the need for an expert bureaucracy to evaluate each prospective project and then to monitor, over several years, each successful project to ensure that the promised emissions reductions actually happen. There are also serious and continuing concerns about the issue of \u201cadditionality\u201d. Under the ERF, it is hard to know whether the Commonwealth is wasting money by paying for emissions reductions that would have taken place anyway \u2013 that is, projects that are not additional. Bear in mind that businesses plan energy-saving projects all the time, so why wouldn\u2019t they try to get a subsidy if one is on offer? Surveys show that a large majority of Australians want stronger action to reduce Australia\u2019s emissions. The role of the Climate Change Authority is to advise on how that desire can be realised, in a way that is consistent with the best scientific and economic evidence. The full minority report can be read here.  Clive Hamilton, Professor of Public Ethics, Centre For Applied Philosophy & Public Ethics (CAPPE) and David Karoly, Professor of Atmospheric Science, University of Melbourne This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article. There's a surprise, a government funded committee returning a report in favour of the government position. Exactly as I thought- Turnbull's seeming turn-around on climate change was just a farce to turn it into a rubber stamp. Modern western politicians can only see until the next election.  They do not have the capacity to see or care about anything beyond that.  Some people believe politicians are qualified to be managing our nations, but the truth is, they are the least competent people on the planet, and the only skill they truly possess is the ability to navigate and manipulate the political system.  At the moment, our world is in the hands of these absolutely moronic and talentless buffoons, and that poses an extraordinary danger to all of us. Good on Clive Hamilton & David Karoly for standing up for what they believe in and calling out the obvious flaws in the way the 'majority' report tries to depict the situation.

VSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7 phones have had a busy couple of weeks. They\u2019re exploding all over the place, and as a result, the company has been forced to issue a massive recall and stop shipments of new phones. Oh, and now the spark-happy gadgets apparently set some poor guy\u2019s Jeep ablaze.\u000a Image: FOX 13 News According to a report from FOX 13 News, St. Petersburg, Florida resident Nathan Dornacher and his family had just returned home from a yard sale on Labour Day when the fire started. Dornacher left his Note 7 in the car to charge while he brought a desk inside, but when he told his his 8-year-old daughter and family dog to get back in the car, he realised something was, uh, not quite right. Image: Facebook\u000aFirefighters were able to contain the fire, but it was too late for Dornacher\u2019s Jeep, which was totaled, according to FOX 13. On Facebook, Dornacher posted his own account of the incident, as well as a number of photos documenting the damage: \u000aNot the barbecue I wanted on my day off. We go to a garage sale to grab a desk for Bonnie get back to the house unload the car leave it running AC on to keep the car cool we were planning on grabbing the dog and Bonnie and heading to Petco, I head back out to the car to grab my phone which was on the charger (me and Lydia always fight over the house charger) go to open the door and see flames inside\u2026 open the door and it\u2019s engulfed run inside to get extinguisher and of course not to be found yell at Lydia to call Fire Department and well here is the end result\u2026.\u000a Samsung told FOX 13 that it was \u201caware of the incident,\u201d and that it was \u201cworking with Mr. Dornacher to investigate his case and ensure we do everything we can for him.\u201d On Facebook, Dornacher noted that while he wasn\u2019t positive yet the phone caused the fire, \u201call signs are pointing that way.\u201d He also complained that Samsung hadn\u2019t been much help, writing in a comment on September 6, \u201cSamsung has blown me off after over a hour on the phone this morning. Never called back as promised. Guess it is time to get a lawyer. You had your chance.\u201d What\u2019s left of the car (Image: Facebook)\u000a What\u2019s left of the Galaxy Note 7 (Image: Facebook)\u000aMeanwhile, in Australia, a Note 7 explosion caused $US1,400 ($1,825) worth of damage to a hotel room, and the US Federal Aviation Administration told Gizmodo this week that it\u2019s mulling a ban on the smartphones. Remember: You can still trade yours in for a less explosion-y model! I bet he just wanted to get rid of his Jeep and used the phone for an explanation of how the car got burnt out. Sounds very suss. That was my thoughts the moment i read the headline too. I bet the insurance was a decent payout, plus he may be trying to get Samsung to pay to cover the cost of a new car as well. Jeep vs Note 7. Who caught fire first? Beat me to it!  Headline should read, Jeep exploded and sets his Note 7 on fire. They probably colluded. I just spat my morning coffee out. Wasted my $3! Was worth it haha! should have bought an iPhone 7 ! Thats what you get for buying a crap phone ;-) Spot the Apple fanboys! and you say it like its a bad thing ;) He already made one bad choice in life ... he bought a Jeep That's an old'ish jeep charging an S7 so there definitely room to question whether which actually 'caused' the fire. His own fault really and if I were Samsung I would be saying to bad, to sad, we advised everyone to power off the devices and stop using them for this exact reason, you didn't listen so your on your own.  I hope he has insurance and I hope the cover it, but again they probably wont as he shouldn't have been using the device in the first place. Not so much exploding as bursting into flames. pretty sure the Jeep was the issue in this instance. but if he can score a new car from Samsung, that'll be impressive. The insurance company will just say that he shouldn't have left his car running whilst unattended so I doubt he'll get anything back!  The guy is an idiot though, there is no way he hadn't heard about the recall so I wouldn't be surprised if he started the fire on purpose to get a new car. "Meanwhile, Samsung said customers who already bought Note 7s could swap them for new smartphones in about two weeks. It's two weeks too late for Nathan" but also told people to turn their devices off, and not to charge them. Which he really can't claim ignorance to if hes been using his explosive smart phone to go online anytime in the last week or so. it was a hard article to avoid. definitely a scam job. Anyone who owns a Jeep should probably just set fire to it themselves instead of waiting for their Samsung phone to do it for them. That way the misery ends a lot faster.

VHaving already restored the original Starship Enterprise and put it back on display, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum needed to find another way to celebrate Star Trek\u2019s birthday today. So it commissioned extraterrestrial linguist Mark Okrand to record special audio tours of the museum in Klingon, to accommodate visitors from Qo\u2019noS.\u000a Mark Okrand, language consultant for Star Trek Okrand, a former Smithsonian post-doctoral fellow, is better known among Trekkies as the linguist who developed the Vulcan and Klingon languages for the Star Trek films and TV series. So who better to record an hour-long highlight tour of the Air and Space Museum\u2019s most popular exhibits in Klingon than him? Maybe Worf, but his Starfleet contract is sealed tighter than an airlock. You can listen to Okrand\u2019s Klingon museum highlight tours on the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum website, through its new GO FLIGHT app which is available for mobile devices through both the iTunes App Store and the Google Play Store, or by watching this fun outtakes video featuring the man himself, the least intimidating Klingon in the galaxy.

VAccording to some, the future of architecture is wood, but in Newark, Ohio, the future has already arrived \u2014 in the form of big, dumb picnic basket that\u2019s also an office building no one will buy.\u000a\u000aPhoto: AP First put on the market 18 months ago for $US7.5 million ($9.7 million), the (sadly stucco-based) former headquarters of struggling basketmaker Longaberger is now available for a mere $US5 million ($6.5 million), Bloomberg reports. Despite the steal of a price, however, listing agent Michael Guagenti says he\u2019s had trouble selling the building, for some reason. \u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging building,\u201d Guagenti told the site. \u201cWe have had a couple [offers] but nothing that materialised.\u201d According to The Columbus Dispatch, the building\u2019s unique design came about 20 years ago, well, about how you\u2019d expect, really: \u000aAfter months of wrangling with architects who had created designs that were merely suggestive of a basket, the colourful, quotable [founder Dave] Longaberger stormed out of a meeting, grabbed one of the company\u2019s medium-sized baskets, came back in, put it on the conference room table and said, \u201cMake it look exactly like that,\u201d said Brenton Baker, director of communications and special initiatives and a longtime employee.\u000a\u000aSo they did.\u000a Even with its highly specialised exterior, Guagenti thinks the building has a lot of potential, noting, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing baskety inside.\u201d \u201c[Y]ou could take the handles off,\u201d Guagenti told Bloomberg. \u201cI\u2019m sure a good architect could come up with some paint scheme to make it look not like a basket.\u201d [Bloomberg] How many square metres of floorspace?

p938
VNinjutsu, the art of the ninja, is an ancient, closely guarded tradition of stealth, martial arts and assassination that is only taught to the most skilled of Japanese warriors\u2026 and pretty much any white dude who happens to be in the neighbourhood. Seriously, it\u2019s like ninjas have their own version of Affirmative Action just for white guys, and thus several Euro-Americans have managed to snag honorary ninja degrees when they had no business doing so. Here are 10 of \u2019em.\u000a  1) Joe Armstrong, American Ninja The bad news is that Private Joe Armstrong has amnesia; the good news is that he still remembers an impressive amount of ninja skills. It seems that when Joe was just a baby, he was raised by one of those kindly ninja who like to adopt white infants and who taught him the arts of ninjutsu until a bomb separated the two and wrecked Joe\u2019s memory. As a soldier, Joe saves his base commander\u2019s daughter from a ninja attack, and then stops a dude from stealing and selling U.S. military weapons, and who also happens to run an evil ninja training academy or something. But Joe was hardly the only American Ninja\u2026  2) Sean Davidson, American Ninja 3: Blood Hunt A new American Ninja was introduced in the third movie, raising many questions. Did Joe Armstrong pass down the title? Did he die? Is \u201cAmerican Ninja\u201d an elected position? Apparently, Sean goes to Japan to receive ninja training \u2014 which he gets with disturbing ease \u2014 to avenge his dad\u2019s murder (like you do). When he wins a martial arts tournament, a bad guy injects him with some germ warfare-type disease he\u2019s trying out, and Sean has to 1) stop the dude, 3) survive his army of genetically modified ninjas and 3) survive the disease. I don\u2019t want to spoil it for you, but he uses ninja powers to do all three things.  3) Joe Kastle, American Ninja V While Joe and Sean would team up in American Ninja IV: The Annihilation, American Ninja V: Not Good Enough for a Subtitle started from scratch with Joe Kastle (who was played by the same guy who played Sean Davidson, for maximum confusion). Joe is an American Ninja who doesn\u2019t do anything particularly ninja-like, although he does teach a kid in a very Karate Kid-esque fashion, and the kid dresses like a ninja sometimes, so maybe that counts? My favourite thing about this movie is this line from its Wikipedia entry, in which someone felt compelled to note: \u201cJoe in addition to being the American Ninja also owns a boat.\u201d  4) Cole, Enter the Ninja The awesomely mustachioed Cole is the \u201cWhite Ninja\u201d in this 1981 movie, and he helpfully wears an all-white ninja costume so people know it. Cole had to face the prejudice of his fellow student Hasegawa as a ninja cadet, one of those backwards guys who think only Japanese people should be ninjas. Their rivalry comes to a head years later when Cole visits a friend and his wife on their farm in the Philippines, where an evil tycoon wants the land for the oil reserve underneath. Cole stops his goons, so who does the tycoon hire to kill Cole? None other than Hasegawa. What are the odds?!  5) Christie, Ninja III: The Domination Enter the Ninja was followed by Revenge of the Ninja, which had the gall to star Japanese actor Sho Kosugi as a Japanese ninja, but things got back on track in Ninja III: The Domination, when\u2026 uh\u2026 a female aerobics instructor gets possessed by the spirit of an evil ninja (the evil ninja was in America, doing evil ninja things, got wounded, and Christie tried to help him as he died, if that makes you feel any better). Anyways, the ninja-filled Christie begins a mission to kill everyone who killed the ninja \u2014 which turns out to be a surprising number of people \u2014 until Sho Kosugi, playing a completely different ninja from Revenge of the Ninja, has to step in.  6) Snake Eyes, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero Snake Eyes \u2014 real name classified \u2014 has had several origins in the many incarnations of G.I. Joe, but they pretty much all end up with him being a white guy who gets himself some serious ninja training, either before or after his face is disfigured and vocal chords destroyed in an attack. In the Marvel comics, he just heads to Japan after his accident and enrolls in ninja school, but in the movie, he\u2019s a homeless white kid who breaks into a dojo, and has a knockdown, drag-out fight with an equally young Storm Shadow, which impresses the Hard Master (which is an incredibly unfortunate name for any teacher at an all-boys school of any sort). At any rate, despite his ninja skills, Snake Eyes stays true to his American roots by being just as comfortable with a gun as he is with a katana. 7) Nicholas Linnear, The Ninja Cycle The star of Eric Lustbader\u2019s six-book \u201cNinja Cycle\u201d series, Nicholas Linner is not totally Causasian, but actually a Chinese-American; since he ends up being a ninja when neither country has anything to do with the Japanese art of ninjutsu, I\u2019m making a small exception. Linnear is a follower of the aka I ninjutsu \u2014 or \u201cred\u201d ninjutsu, a.k.a. \u201cgood\u201d ninjutsu. His nemesis, cousin Saigo, is a kuji/black/evil ninja who hates the hell out of Nicholas for beating him in a duel as kids. The first book, simply titled The Ninja, features Nicholas as he tries to protect his new girlfriend\u2019s dad from an assassin who of course turns out to be Saigo. But in later books, things apparently take a dark turn when Saigo rapes both Nicholas\u2019 girlfriend and Nicholas and then kills the girlfriend. Yikes.  8) Casey Bowman, Ninja Much like Snake Eyes \u2014 ok, exactly like Snake Eyes \u2014 Casey Bowman, the star of 2009\u2019s Ninja, is adopted by a ninja clan at a young age, becomes really good at it, and annoys the hell out of Masazuka, the Japanese former top pupil. Eventually, Masazuka becomes a highly paid assassin, kills the dojo\u2019s sensei, and tries to get a chest containing a ancient ninja treasure, but Casey manages to spirit it away to New York first. There, Scott is framed for murder, the sensei\u2019s daughter is captured, a police station is infiltrated and ninja are fought \u2014 all standard ninja operating procedure, at least until the daughter is poisoned and Casey realises his katana has an antidote hidden inside it because \u201ckatana can heal\u201d or some nonsense. Incidentally, Casey is played by Scott Adkins, who was also the mouthless Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, so\u2026 gross.  9) Frank Dux, Bloodsport Trained by a Japanese master of ninjutsu, Frank Dux enters the Kumite martial arts tournament in Hong Kong. Despite being trained by a master of ninjutsu, Frank uses almost no ninjutsu in any of his fights, instead using very generic martial arts with perhaps a slight preference for kickboxing. And during the training montage (above) with his ninja master, the master doesn\u2019t teach him any ninja movies either \u2014 just more basic martial arts, how to serve tea blindfolded, and forcing him to endure some mild torture. Seriously, the only thing even slightly ninja-like about any of this is that people say it\u2019s ninjutsu, even when it clearly isn\u2019t. Interestingly, Bloodsport is actually based on a real book by a real Frank Dux who claims to be a real ninja himself. Shockingly, Dux\u2019s tale seems to be complete bullshit.  10) John Peter McAllister, Master Ninja Finding himself at loose ends and entranced by the tranquility of post-war Japan (?), John Peter McAllister stuck around after fighting in World War II and ended up as \u201cthe first Occidental-American to ever achieve the status of the ninja.\u201d He returns to America in the \u201980s to look for the daughter he suddenly discovers he has, gets chased by a ninja who is really upset he left Japan (played by Sho Kosugi), and meets Max, a moron with a hamster and a van, whom McAllister teaches the ways of the ninja while they travel from small town to small town, looking for John\u2019s daughter and getting into adventures. (For the record, Max is played by Timothy Van Patton, who would go on to be an Emmy-winning HBO TV director of Deadwood, Game of Thrones and more, which never fails to blow my mind.) This was actually part of a short-lived TV series called The Master, which was edited into a few incomprehensible movies dubbed Master Ninja, two of which ended up on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. I used the MST3K version because MST3K rules. Awesome!  Ninja night marathon needed now... As much as I love the American Ninja series of movies (Trust me, those VHS got alot of plays as a child), I believe the movie Blind Fury has tragically been left out. I mean who could pass up a movie about US soldier who is blinded in action, and then trained how to wield a sword like no other using his remaining senses? This movie also possesses one of the greatest two person one liners in movie history. When two gentlemen are stuck in an elevator, one says "Sheet", the second says "Farque", and then in unison they claim, "SheetFarque". Simply brilliant! Because Rutger Hauer's character is taught some sort of Vietnamese swordsmanship by villagers.    Not Ninjutsu though.  (In any case, the average Vietnamese villager knows this stuff.) To alligator: "Nice doggie." There's no such thing as Vietnamese Ninjitsu you say? Well I'm going down to my local Viet Ninja dojo and demanding all of my money back! "Ninjutsu, the art of the ninja, is an ancient, closely guarded tradition of stealth, martial arts and assassination that is only taught to the most skilled of Japanese warriors\u2026 and pretty much any white dude who happens to be in the neighbourhood." I happen to be a white dude who studied Ninjutsu. Studied with the Bujinkan school (founded by Ninjutsu Grand Master Masaaki Hatsumi). There are many other schools around too and pretty much any white dude can study Ninjutsu now days. Wait.. Am I racist 'cause I studied Ninjutsu? Christ Farley - Beverly Hills Ninja - Haru. Enough said :-) This

VWith so many flavours of Linux and the awesome apps in their repositories, finding the right app for getting things done can be tough. In our annual Lifehacker Pack for Linux, we\u2019re highlighting the must-have downloads for better productivity, communication, media management, and more.\u000a The Lifehacker Pack is a yearly snapshot of our favourite, essential applications for each of our favourite platforms. For our always-updating directory of all the best apps, be sure to bookmark our Linux App Directory.\u000a Unlike Windows and OS X, Linux isn\u2019t one cohesive entity. There are a ton of different distributions based on Linux, with different desktop environments to choose from and different apps already built into the system. There\u2019s more than one way to build a happy Linux machine, so don\u2019t fret if your favorite is missing! In many cases, we\u2019re highlighting a few standouts in each category, so you can decide which one is the best fit for your system. We love app launchers and the speed they bring to our workflow, and they can do a lot more than just launch apps.Unfortunately, now that GNOME Do hasn\u2019t had any major updates since 2009, Synapse \u2014 the awesome GNOME Do alternative with Zeitgeist integration \u2014 is our current pick. If you\u2019re using Ubuntu\u2019s Unity interface or the GNOME Shell, you can probably skip this, as they have a lot of app launcher functionality built right in. But for those on other desktop environments, we recommend at least checking out Synapse for your app launching and other needs. Alternatively, GNOME Do is still available for download, and if you\u2019re really a minimalist, you might like dmenu. KDE users have the handy KRunner built in as well. When the built-in Gedit just doesn\u2019t cut it, Kate and Geany will bring some more advanced coding and development features to the table. They have got a similar feature set, but Kate is our favourite text editor, providing syntax highlighting, code collapsing, on-the-fly spell checking, a vi-like input mode, and even code autocompletion. If you need more than the built-in editors can provide, Kate and Geany will make you happy. If you want something even more hardcore than these, check out Eclipse or Sublime Text 2. And if you\u2019re pining for Notepad++, check out Notepadqq. Text expansion is one of the greatest improvements you can make to your productivity. Think of any tedious typing you do during the day \u2014 addresses, canned email responses, bits of code, or anything else \u2014 and imagine being able to type it all with just a few keystrokes. That\u2019s what text expansion does, and it can save you hours of typing. There aren\u2019t a lot of text expansion apps for Linux, but AutoKey fits the bill well enough. You\u2019ll need some Python skills for the more advanced snippets, but right now, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got. Chances are, LibreOffice comes with your Linux distribution, but just in case it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ve added it here. From documents to spreadsheets to presentations and more, LibreOffice has the tools you need to get things done, especially if you\u2019re sending files back and forth with people who use Microsoft Office. Chrome is our favourite on all three platforms this year. It\u2019s fast, powerful, syncs everything, and has an incredible extension library. The version that comes with your distribution may be its open-source cousin, Chromium, which has all the same advantages. (One minor difference: you have to install the flash plugin separately if you want it, although your distro probably has a tool to make that easy.) That said, Firefox is also a great option if it\u2019s what you\u2019re used to. We still think Pidgin is the best IM client around on Linux, despite the fact the Ubuntu developers (and others) have ditched it for programs like Empathy. Not only does it support loads of IM protocols and features, it has a pretty sweet extension library that lets you do just about anything you want with it. If you\u2019re using GNOME shell, Empathy does have some nice integration options, though, so it\u2019s worth a look too. Google Hangouts beats Skype on Linux hands-down, but only because Skype still isn\u2019t available for modern 64-bit architectures. Unfortunately, most people use Skype for their video chat needs, which means someone in your life \u2014 friends, family, or other\u2014is going to want to video chat with you on it one day. Use Hangouts if you can, but figure out those Skype install issues now so you can keep it in your pocket for when you need it. Chances are, your Linux distribution of choice comes with a solid video player, like MPlayer. For most people, that\u2019s fine, but if you need something with a bit more control, VLC is a good place to start. It supports more video and audio formats than you can shake a stick at, and it requires virtually no work to get your movies playing \u2014 though it does have some handy command line tools for you advanced users out there.  Linux actually has a few solid photo management tools, but our favourite is definitely digiKam. It\u2019s more on the professional side of things, which means it has more features than you can shake a stick at, including a lot of organisation options, support for over 300 RAW formats and the ability to compare pictures side-by-side. It is a bit complicated to use, though \u2014 so if you prefer something a bit simpler, Shotwell may be more your speed. It does the basic sorting, tagging, and editing most users need, plus it has the built-in ability to share photos to Facebook and Flickr (a feature digiKam also boasts). If you\u2019re editing something that can\u2019t be done in digiKam or Shotwell \u2014 whether it\u2019s a screenshot or you just need some more advanced tools \u2014 the GIMP can probably get it done. It may not be Photoshop, but it can do an awful lot on its own. Picking a music player for this list was tough. Linux has a big selection, and as we\u2019ve said before, music players are an incredibly personal choice. In the end, we decided on Clementine. It has a good set of features, an easy-to-browse interface, and is loved by basic and advanced users alike. If you want something a bit different, we recommend checking out Banshee and Amarok, too. No matter what you pick for your music player, we recommend having a streaming service on hand, even if it isn\u2019t your main player. We like Spotify, and while it isn\u2019t technically supported on Linux, Spotify has some preview builds available that can at least get you up and streaming. You can also just use the web player if you don\u2019t mind giving up a browser tab. These days, lots of us have more than just one device. Maybe it\u2019s a Linux machine at home and a Windows computer at work. Or maybe it\u2019s three computers, a smartphone, a tablet, and a netbook running Archbang. Whatever your span of devices, Dropbox is absolutely essential for keeping all your files (and other stuff) in sync. You get 2GB of free space to start, but it\u2019s really easy to load up on extra space for free. When you have to download a large file, BitTorrent is almost always a better alternative than a slow direct download. Linux has some good BitTorrent choices, but our favourite client is Deluge. It\u2019s simple to use feature-rich, and has a nice plugin library, so advanced users have all the features they need to tweak their speed and privacy to their liking. If you aren\u2019t a fan of Deluge, try qBitTorrent \u2014 it\u2019s equally as awesome. Everyone needs a backup. There\u2019s no worse feeling than having your hard drive crash and having to start from scratch. Enter CrashPlan. While you could always back up to an external drive, that won\u2019t save you if you lose your computer in a fire, burglary, or other disaster. CrashPlan backs your computer up to the cloud, using either CrashPlan\u2019s cloud service or a friend\u2019s computer, keeping your data safe no matter what. Plus, it\u2019s really easy to set up. Set it, forget it, and relax. Linux has a lot of file archiving tools, and if you\u2019re a command line buff, look no further than the terminal to get everything done (whether it\u2019s the built-in tar command or the awesome p7zip). But, if you need a more friendly GUI, PeaZip is our pick. It may not be pretty, but it can work with over 130 different archive types, encrypt archives for safe keeping, and integrate with both GNOME and KDE. Plus, it still has the command line features advanced users crave, for when the GUI isn\u2019t necessary. Linux has some awesome apps, but sometimes the big guys ignore Linux and we\u2019re left out in the cold. Wine is (sometimes) the answer: if you\u2019ve got a Windows program you can\u2019t leave behind (whether it\u2019s Outlook for work, Photoshop for images, or World of Warcraft for fun), Wine will run it on your Linux desktop. It doesn\u2019t work with every program out there, but Wine\u2019s app database will help you figure out which ones work well, so you can get one step closer to leaving Windows behind forever. When Wine doesn\u2019t cut it and you just have to run that Windows program or two, VirtualBox is your next choice. VirtualBox will run an entire Windows installation in a virtual machine, so you can perform all your Windows tasks without ever leaving Linux. It isn\u2019t always ideal, but if you\u2019re stuck with Windows at work, for example, this might end up being the compromise you need. Linux users spend a lot more time in the terminal than the average Windows or Mac user, which means you should have a really good terminal emulator on hand. The default terminal that comes with your distro may be fine, but Terminator will take your command line work to the next level. You can arrange terminals in a grid, re-order them, configure a bevy of keyboard shortcuts, save your layouts, and a lot more. If you don\u2019t want or need everything Terminator has to offer, you might still want to check out Guake and Yakuake, the awesome drop-down terminals you can access with a keyboard shortcut. The command line is often the fastest and easiest way to do simple tasks, and the standard command line tools that come with your distro are already immensely powerful. There\u2019s more where those came from, though! Here are a just a few bonus tools that you may not have realised existed. \u000apdftk contract.pdf cat 1-9 output firstnine.pdf\u000apdftk firstnine.pdf lastpage.pdf output signedcontract.pdf\u000a Plenty of other tools in our pack have command-line equivalents, too.

p942
VDoctors and parents sometimes disagree about a child\u2019s medical treatment. As the recent case of six-year-old boy Oshin Kiszko highlights, some disagreements between doctors and parents can\u2019t be resolved by further information and discussion.  Rosalind McDougall is a Research Fellow in Ethics at the University of Melbourne Oshin has brain cancer. His doctors believe he should receive treatment aimed at curing his disease, while Oshin\u2019s parents believe the potential benefits of treatment don\u2019t justify side-effects and other negative outcomes for their son, such as the possibility of long-term health issues. They want Oshin to receive only palliative care to ensure his comfort in the remaining months of his life. In March, Western Australia\u2019s Family Court mandated Oshin be given chemotherapy. The most recent judgement, after another two court cases, supports a palliative pathway for Oshin as his chance of a cure has decreased. Oshin\u2019s case is unique. Not all disagreements between doctors and parents reach court. Many are resolved in the hospital and many do not involve life-threatening conditions. In our recent research project, we investigated types of conflicts that can arise between doctors and parents in a paediatric hospital and the ethics of these situations. We developed an approach called the \u201czone of parental discretion\u201d to assist doctors in deciding whether a parental choice should be overridden. This is a tool that holds it is ethical for doctors to accept a treatment option parents want, providing it is good enough, rather than insisting on the best possible treatment. Parents are the default medical decision-makers for their children for many ethically important reasons. Usually, parents know their children best and this knowledge \u2013 alongside the clinical expertise of doctors \u2013 is important in understanding how their child may experience a particular medical treatment. Parents also bear the primary burden of the medical decisions made for their children, caring for them in the long term. But the parental right to make medical decisions is not unlimited. Their decision-making role is sometimes questioned when they don\u2019t agree with the recommended treatment for their child. There are many ways in which parents may do this. They might, for example, decline diagnostic testing they perceive as unnecessary. Others might refuse aspects of physiotherapy they see as distressing for the child, such as painful stretching. To avoid blood transfusion for religious reasons, parents sometimes prefer a different, less-effective form of surgery to that recommended by the doctors. In one case, parents declined artificial feeding for an undernourished child with a disability, preferring the child remained lighter for lifting. And in other instances, parents of children with cancer have refused conventional treatment in favour of alternative therapies. Traditionally, clinicians have thought in terms of the child\u2019s best interests when deciding how to respond when parents disagree with their recommendations. Acting in a child\u2019s best interests means doing the thing that will have the best possible outcome for him or her. There are two main problems with this approach. First, a child\u2019s well-being is made up of different elements, such as being free from pain, having a long lifespan, having meaningful relationships and being able to play. There is no straightforward way of calculating well-being and comparing it across treatment options to identify which would be best. And there are often several possible courses of action, each of which would benefit the child in different ways. Second, the best interests approach may not adequately acknowledge parental autonomy. Parental decision-making often involves weighing up the interests of different family members \u2013 which are ethically appropriate considerations \u2013 and parents may be choosing against the best possible outcome for a particular child in order to care for the family as a whole. When there is an entrenched disagreement between doctors and parents, focusing only on whether the parents are choosing in the child\u2019s best interests is ethically problematic. Doctors should balance the child\u2019s well-being and the parents\u2019 autonomy by accepting choices that may be sub-optimal for the child, as long as they are not harmful. Parents refusing treatment for their child is one type of situation for which doctors seek clinical ethics advice in paediatric hospitals. Although clinical ethics support services are widespread and longstanding in the United States and United Kingdom, in Australia they are in their infancy. Over the past decade, clinical ethics support has been established at a few large metropolitan hospitals and more hospitals are working to make these services available to their staff. We know that some clinical ethicists find the \u201czone of parental discretion\u201d idea helpful when working through issues of disagreement about a child\u2019s treatment. This approach focuses on the potential harmfulness of the parents\u2019 decision rather than trying to identify and insist on the option in the child\u2019s best interests. There are some parental choices that do not optimise the child\u2019s well-being but will not harm the child. For example, the parents\u2019 preferred form of surgery may not be the best available, but may still be very likely to effectively treat the child\u2019s condition. Such decisions fall within the boundary of the parents\u2019 discretion and should not be overridden. The outer boundary of the zone of parental discretion is harm to the child. Parents are not ethically entitled to choose options that may harm the child. For example, if parents are refusing physiotherapy necessary to ensure their child will walk again, this choice is outside the zone of parental discretion and should be overriden. Thinking about situations of deep disagreement in this way enables clinicians to respect and balance the two important values of parental autonomy and children\u2019s well-being. The zone of parental discretion is a conceptual tool, suited both to formal clinical ethics case discussions and more informal reflection and decision-making. By expanding our thinking beyond only \u201cbest interests\u201d, we give clinicians more helpful ways of working ethically through these very difficult situations. This article was originally published on The Conversation. Do we even have the right to raise our children anymore? We can punish them, we can't take their phone away from them, we can't treat/non-treat them in a way we feel is best for them. It's not like they are using alternative treatments that would make it worse. By golly we have to pay for everything with children, but our rights are slowly being stripped away. Who should have the final say? The doctor treating the child and the court system if the parents cant agree. In most of these cases you usually see one parent on the proven medical science side of things, And the other wants to go some wacky natural homeopathic route. \u000a									Last edited September 9, 2016 1:43 am

VGoogle has announced that it has teamed up with cloud storage provider Box which will see a tighter integration between their productivity offerings. It opens doors for Google Docs users to easily store documents in Box, which is a curious decision given Google already has its own online storage service. Meanwhile, Box will get access to Google Springboard, an AI assistant tool that helps users search for information they need and provides recommendations of what they might want to see. Read on for more details.  While the Google and Box partnership seems like an odd one at first glance, the truth is both companies stand to benefit from the team-up. Box has a sizable enterprise customer base and allowing Google Docs to be seamlessly stored in the cloud storage service means more people will be inclined to consider using the productivity suite. Users can create and edit Docs, Sheets and Slides directly from Box. Box is set to gain access to Google\u2019s powerful tool Springboard, which is essentially an intelligent search engine that helps users find the information they want within compatible services in a quick and easy way. According to Google head of global technology partners Nan Boden:  \u000a\u201cWe want our customers to have flexibility in their choice of tools and to have the most productive and collaborative suite possible for their needs. In fact, several of our own customers, like Avago, Intuit, Internet2 and Whirlpool already use Box and Google together, and these integrations will contribute to a more productive and collaborative enterprise. We\u2019re excited to partner closely with Box to expand our efforts in the enterprise and transform how businesses work in the cloud.\u201d\u000a [Via Google For Work Blog]

p946
VFinding out the maximum amount of weight you can currently lift, or your one-rep max, is exhilarating, but it can also be risky and dangerous. Instead of testing it out in the real world yourself, you can get a fair estimation another way: Lift between five to eight reps, remember the amount of weight you lifted and plug them into this calculator.\u000a\u000aImage by Fort Meade. Let\u2019s say I did 5 reps of 68kg front squats. I plug those numbers into ExRx.net\u2019s calculator and get 77kg as my estimated one-rep max. It\u2019s fairly close. The calculator also breaks this one-rep max estimate further down into varying percentages, all the way down to 50 per cent of your one-rep max. This is helpful because some weight training programs call for lifting at 85 per cent of your 1RM, for example. With this, you\u2019ll know exactly what weight to do that still challenges you, and you\u2019ll be able to know if you\u2019re getting stronger if you can gradually do more reps, or do it more easily at the same percentage. When you test, it doesn\u2019t have to be between five to eight reps, but you should be confident that you can hit that rep range with the heaviest weight you can manage, rather than going hard and potentially hurting yourself with a one-rep max. A real one-rep max test can be good if you know what you are doing and have people there to keep an eye on you, should anything go south. Predicting One-Rep Max [ExRx.net]

p952
VThe nicely coloured Microsoft Lumia 750 could be launched at this year\u2019s MWC. Without doubt Mobile World Congress, or MWC, is one of the world\u2019s largest gatherings for the mobile industry. Due to take place in Barcelona from 22-25 February, it usually sees the major manufacturers (with the exception of Apple of course who like to do their own thing) announce all their new products for the coming months. Here are five announcements we expect to be made. Microsoft Lumia 750\u000a\u000aThough the US giant has recently unveiled both the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL, the Windows 10 Mobile Handset range is looking a little sparse with only 550 joining the flagship duo. So it seems likely (though by no means certain) we will see the launch of two new mid-range models, the Lumia 750 and 850, at February\u2019s MWC in Barcelona. Though little is known about the 850, the 750 is believed to feature a Snapdragon 617 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and either a 5.4-inch or 5.7-inch Full HD screen. Samsung Galaxy S7\u000a\u000aLast year at MWC Samsung announced a number of new products, including the S6 and S6  Edge. And this year also promises to be no different with a number of products in the pipeline. On February 21, the day before MWC officially opens, the South Korean company will hold its Unpacked Event where journalists will be shown the latest Samsung Galaxy S7 and possibly the S7 Edge variant. Rumours are that some of the features removed from the S6 could make a return, including a microSD card slot and possibly water resistant casing. Other possible features include Snapdragon 820 or Exynos M1 processor, a strong magnesium alloy build, and a durable Turtle Glass display, pressure-sensitive 3D Touch-like technology and an even better 12MP camera. There\u2019s also talk of Samsung unveiling a large screen Galaxy S7 Edge+. Is this what the LG G5 will look like? Hopefully we\u2019ll find out at MWC16 LG G5 LG doesn\u2019t always unveil its flagship products at MWC (last year it skipped the event because it didn\u2019t want to be overshadowed by the Samsung Galaxy S6 line up). However, this year is thought to be an exception. Like its South Korean rivals, LG will have a press event the day before MWC officially opens where it\u2019s expected to announced the new LG G5. Rumours are that it will boast a metal body complete with Snapdragon 820 processor, a whopping 21 Megapixel camera and even retinal scanning. Android Authority has produced a sketch of what the LG G5 might look like based on insider information (see above) with the volume controls moving from the rear back to a more conventional side position. LG is also thought to be about to launch its own payment service, similar to Samsung Pay and Apple Pay but we\u2019ll see. Sony Xperia Z6 Previously Sony has favoured double launches, announcing new models at both MWC in Barcelona and IFA in Berlin. But could the Japanese brand be set to depart from this protocol and unveil the successor to the Xperia Z5 which it launched at IFA last year? We can\u2019t say for sure but one thing we can tell you is that will be a press launch first thing Monday morning (22nd February) at the show when all the new products will be announced. If it\u2019s not the Sony Xperia Z6, then expect to see a tablet or two, such as the Tablet Z2 or the Xperia Z4, as Sony generally does love to launch a tablet in Barcelona. Also a possibility is a new wearable. It\u2019s been 18 months since we saw the Sony Smartwatch 3 so there\u2019s the possibility of an upgraded Smartwatch 4. Alternatively, we could see Sony make a fuss over the Xperia M5 pro-selfie which it announced in August 2015, but which has only just gone on sale in the UK. HTC One M10\u000a\u000aAt MWC 2015, HTC launched the One M9, so it seems likely that it will present the latest model in its One line up at this year\u2019s Barcelona show. Currently codenamed \u2018Perfume\u2019, it will be called the M10, though it is expected to differ substantially from its predecessor, at least according to the rumours. For a start it\u2019s expected to be a lot sleeker than the previous M9 with much more minimalist design, more like the One A9 in fact. The biggest difference between the M9 and M10 is likely to be the lack of BoomSound speakers on the new model in order to keep the compact size. Other features are expected to include a fingerprint scanner and a 5.1 inch 2560 x 1440 AMOLED display. Although it seems likely HTC\u2019s M10 will launch at MWC there is always the possibility that the new model won\u2019t launch until March so we might have to wait a little longer!   Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related).

VA few months ago, connected speaker maven Sonos said it was working on bringing voice control to its speakers. Now, Sonos is announcing a long-term relationship with Amazon whereby you\u2019ll be able to control your Sonos speakers from your Amazon Echo. This is just awesome news.\u000a  By early 2017, all Amazon Alexa devices \u2014 including the Echo, Tap, and Dot \u2014 will be able to control the Sonos ecosystem. Which effectively means you can get an Echo Dot as a poor man\u2019s virtual receiver to add voice control to a more complex Sonos experience throughout your house. Amazon hasn\u2019t released official numbers for it Alexa ecosystem, but analysts estimate that more than 3 million Echo devices have been sold since early 2015. And with Amazon pushing the Echo and Alexa ecosystems so prominently, we can only expect those numbers to increase. Additionally, users will be able to control their Sonos system from the Spotify app, using Spotify Connect protocol that\u2019s been available for a couple of years. Spotify Connect allows the Spotify app to control outside speakers and devices. In the case of Sonos, you can use your Spotify app on mobile or desktop, to send music to a Sonos speaker. You can even do this remotely, so if you\u2019re in the car and want to start a certain playlist or album to start in your living room before you even get into the house, you can do that. Users will be able to control their Sonos via Spotify in the next few weeks. Sonos is now 14-years-old, in the intervening years it basically invented the wi-fi connected speaker system. The company sees the strategic shift towards voice control as critical. According to Sonos President Patrick Spence, the biggest trends driving Sonos are the explosion in popularity of paid streaming music services and the increasingly connected home. With the new move, Sonos wants to be be the sound platform for the connected home. Part of being that platform is working with every service and platform available to users. Already, Sonos does a pretty good job in so far as it supports basically every streaming audio service you can think of.. Sonos works with Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Amazon Music, Google Play and more. The move to embracing voice assistants makes sense for the wireless speaker company. In March, Sonos announced it was laying off some of its staff and focusing its efforts not as much on the hardware devices that made the company famous, but on software. And in 2016, software improvements inevitably means voice control. It\u2019s notable that Sonos\u2019 commitment to improving its software means embracing the software made by others. For years, Sonos users have complained that its own apps were often a pain to use. And although Sonos is working on streamlining that software, giving full control of the Spotify experience to Spotify \u2014 and the Alexa experience to Amazon devices \u2014 signifies that Sonos knows that is role as a platform doesn\u2019t necessarily have to include making its own software front and center forever. Sonos is so beloved by its users because its the true definition of a product that just works. Still, we\u2019d be lying if we said it didn\u2019t feel like Sonos\u2019 mojo had stalled a bit, especially in light of other competitors in the wireless speaker space. But getting reliable, usable voice control from Amazon, has the potential of making an already great experience even better. Meanwhile, Amazon has a great, if nascent, technology with Alexa. But the app and device platform, while growing, has lacked its killer app. I think Sonos support could be Alexa\u2019s killer app, especially for music lovers. If you\u2019re a Sonos and an Echo owner, this should be a very happy day.

VShyness isn\u2019t a lifelong personality trait. Learning to talk to strangers is a skill you can acquire. Want to know how Conan O\u2019Brien and Will Ferrell got over their shyness? Using a technique called \u201cradical implosion\u201d.\u000a\u000aRadical implosion is based on psychologist Albert Ellis\u2018s shame-attacking exercise. The idea is to do something much more intimidating than whatever you\u2019re afraid of. Once you get over that, your original problem seems easy, and the anxiety around it more manageable. For example, Conan O\u2019Brien started performing live comedy because that\u2019s what frightened him most. To over his shyness, Will Ferrell would purposely do idiotic things in public, so people would laugh at him. While their examples are extreme, the core idea is solid. If you\u2019re afraid of talking to people at a party, go and talk to 50 strangers in a park first. Just see what happens.

VOne of the coolest things about the first Guardians of the Galaxy was how director James Gunn had Vin Diesel voicing Groot.

The retailer, which already partners with cyclist Chris Boardman, has unveiled 10 new designs aimed aimed squarely at children from the age of 3 upwards. Available from July, prices will start from just £100. Included in the range is everything from a balance bike for very young children right through to a road bike for teenagers, the Wiggins Rouen 700C,  (pictured above). This will retail for around £375. Rather than producing a range of exclusive high-end bikes (the Boardman range starts at £499), Wiggins is aiming his range at the mass market to get more people into cycling. Says Sir Bradley Wiggins, who was at the official launch of his bikes at the Halfords Spring Summer press event in London\u2019s Soho yesterday: \u201cEveryone remembers riding a bike as a kid. It\u2019s the first real rush you experience in life. It\u2019s like flying. To be a small part of that by creating these bikes is really exciting. \u201cI want Olympic champions to say, \u2018I started on a Wiggins bike\u2019\u2026it\u2019s possible.\u201d Meanwhile, Halfords has announced a surge in sales of dashcams, up 800% year on year as mainly older drivers aim to protect themselves against uninsured drivers and perceived scams where drivers flash to let you go and then drive into you to claim the insurance. New products include the Nextbase 312 GW. Set to retail for £99 it features integrated wifi and comes with an app so drivers can share footage with their insurer and on social media. It will be available exclusively from Halfords from this month. I have just brought the 312gw today it seem ok the WiFi is poor. its very slow.

VSony has announced the PlayStation 4 Slim today. Find out when you\u2019ll be able to get the new console and how much it will cost here in Australia.  The PlayStation 4 Slim shares the same internal specs as the PlayStation 4, which is going to be phased out and replaced by the skinnier version. According to Sony, the new PlayStation 4 Slim is more energy efficient \u201cas the power consumption has been cut by more than 34% and 28% compare to the very first and current models\u201d. It\u2019s also 30% smaller compared to previous models and 25% lighter. The console will support HDR (High Dynami Range) imaging technology, which enables the reproduction of brightness and darkness while realising a much wider range of colours. The 500GB version of the PlayStation 4 Slim will be available in Australia from September 15 retailing for $439.95. The 1TB model will be available from September 29 for $509.95. If you would prefer a more powerful console, Sony also announced the PlayStation 4 Pro today.

VAn inquiry is being launched today by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission into whether or not to declare a wholesale domestic mobile roaming service, which would enable mobile service providers to provide coverage in areas where they don\u2019t have their own network. An increasing reliance on mobile services and the issue of coverage and a lack of choice in some regional areas is a particular issue that has been raised by a number of groups, the ACCC says. There has been significant interest in the questions around access to mobile networks and mobile roaming, including from representatives from regional Australia, the Regional Telecommunications Review Committee, Infrastructure Australia and the House of Representatives Agriculture Committee. The ACCC says a declaration inquiry would focus on a number of key issues, including how consumer demands for mobile services are evolving, and whether there are differences in regional areas to urban areas. The likely investment plans of each of the mobile network operators to extend coverage and upgrade technology are also a focus, as is whether there are any significant barriers to expanding the reach of mobile networks. Lessons from similar experience with domestic mobile roaming in other countries will also be taken on board.  The ACCC has previously considered mobile roaming in regional areas in inquiries held in 1998 and 2005 respectively. On both occasions it decided not to regulate an access service as it was satisfied roaming agreements were being commercially negotiated. \u201cNetwork coverage is clearly a key feature of a mobile service, and each of the mobile network operators has extended its networks since we last looked at this issue in detail,\u201d ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said. \u201cA lot has changed since 2005. We do think it\u2019s time we look at the issue again in detail, and examine some of these key matters, including consumer demand, network investment, and barriers to competition. We consider the most efficient way to do that is to consider all of the issues carefully through a declaration inquiry.\u201d Mr Sims stressed that, at this stage, the ACCC had not formed any views on whether declaration of a mobile roaming service would deliver benefits for consumers. \u201cA particular area of concern for us is whether consumers would, in fact, be disadvantaged if the incentives to invest in expanding the reach of mobile networks were reduced,\u201d Mr Sims said. The ACCC has also released an issues paper today for a separate but parallel market study into the communications market as a whole. \u201cWe considered whether we should examine mobile roaming issues as part of the market study. However, we decided that a more focused inquiry to deal with the issue more quickly will provide the market with greater certainty, sooner,\u201d said Mr Sims. So any incentive Optus and Voda will have for investing in areas they haven't will be gone, as will any continued investment on Telstra's part. Yep, this will make the situation better. If they intend to apply it to voice and data. If it's voice only, it will make very little impact. Data is where the money is. \u000a									Last edited September 5, 2016 6:29 pm								 It's gotta be everything or nothing. Voice and Data.  All this will do is bring the same level of competition to the country that exists in the city. Yes this will drive down overall prices, as Telstra doesn't (can't) differentiate plan prices based on city vs country. Optus and Voda can enter the country market and win customers from Telstra. Telstra will lower their prices, to win customers back, which will lead to Optus and Voda lowering theirs further, devaluing the total market. The profitability of Optus and Voda actually relies on Telstra having to charge more. Neither will allow Telstra to undercut them. If the market is devalued too far, smaller players could get forced out in the long run. Those customers would probably be grabbed by the big three, which would lead to...less competition. Again, if Optus and Voda can access Telstra's towers, there's no incentive for Optus and Voda to roll out their own, nor is Telstra going to roll out new ones, knowing they then have to give access to their competition. Same thing happened with the HFC network. Optus and Vodafone already have agreements to share towers. They put their equipment on each other's towers all the time. Shockingly Optus has agreed with Telstra that things should remain as they are. Only Voda thinks they should have access to Telstra and Optus' hardware.

VMuch of the influence that sulphate and black carbon aerosol emissions from East Asia have on the climate is actually driven by consumption in developed countries (New Zealand and Australia, specifically) rather than in East Asia itself, international scientists say.  A recent study shows that international trade shifts the climate impacts of aerosol emissions \u2014 known as radiative forcing \u2014 from net consuming countries to net producing countries. Unlike greenhouse gases, aerosols (such as sulfate or black carbon) emitted through industrial processes or fossil fuel combustion typically only remain in the atmosphere for a short time (days to weeks). As a result, their influence on climate is usually strongest in the region around the source of their emission.  Previous studies have demonstrated the role that international trade has in redistributing greenhouse gases and other pollutant emissions and in altering regional air quality, but the effects on climate forcing due to aerosols is unclear. Jintai Lin, Qiang Zhang, Yi Huang and colleagues estimated aerosol emissions related to the production and consumption of goods and services for 11 global regions and then compared the influence that the production-related aerosols and consumption-related aerosols have on the global climate and the climate of those regions.  They found that, as East Asia is a large net exporter of emissions-intensive goods, radiative forcing due to the production of goods in the region is much stronger than the radiative forcing related to the consumption of goods.  However, for net importing regions, such as western Europe, North America and Oceania OECD (Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand), they found the opposite is true: radiative forcing related to consumption is much greater than production-related forcing.  Policymakers in countries that are net exporters of emissions-intensive goods could consider whether some of the costs of more stringent local environmental regulations can be passed on to consumers in net importing regions, the researchers suggest. [Nature] Isnt this the normal problem with burning brown coal So it is our fault they can't get a handle on their aerosol emissions is it? They manufacture for a price, we pay that price, if the price doesn't include environmental protection in it not our bad.  (Including environmental protection and decent living wage in the price of products would likely close the competitive advantage and we could repatriate manufacturing jobs at zero net cost, win win.) Exactly, they can't bitch that they're riding an economic wave on the backs of consumerism when they did everything in their power to foster it. We can take the moral high ground and stop using them, but we'd say goodbye to all our cheap consumer goods, and nobody would support that! It's not unreasonable to support Australian industry. They quality you obtain far exceeds the cost. Consumers need to be less fickle. New Zealand has roughly %73 of it's electricity generated by renewable energy sources compared to Australia's %14. Your point is? The article has absolutely nothing to do with power generation in Australia or New Zealand. It's about us buying the things made in these countries so that we don't have to pay for the emission standards that we demand for our own air. Effectively we are exporting our pollution to these countries. I'm sorry, that argument (about exporting pollution) is just a non-starter.\u000aIf I can't control their emissions policy I have no responsibility for their emissions. \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 8:10 pm								 Sorry, you're wrong. You have 100% control over what products you purchase and what countries those products are made in. Example, people will boycott various food products because the ingredients used in them either cause the destruction of rain forest (palm oil) or the farmers who grow them are ripped off by the multi-national companies who make the product you buy (coffee). You are responsible for the products you buy and the damage they cause. But you can tell yourself you're not responsible, if that's what you need to do to sleep at night. 1:  I suggest not employing adhominem attack, it maims your credibility. 2:  Boycotting a product is a great way to change policy at your local store and an abysmal way to change environmental policy in another country, you have no idea who you're going to hurt, so it's likely to be the poor. \u000a									Last edited September 8, 2016 6:27 pm								 There's only so much 'stuff' that 30 million people (roughly Aus + NZ) can consume, and that's a drop in the proverbial ocean compared to their total market. Don't blame others for your inability to control your belching smokestacks. Policymakers in countries that are net exporters of emissions-intensive goods could consider whether some of the costs of more stringent local environmental regulations can be passed on to consumers in net importing regions, the researchers suggest. This sentence is the crux of it, and it results from consumers' overwhelming demand for "cheapness". Many pricing models do not take pollution or environmental impact into consideration because that adds cost.  For instance, they may well assume a cost of zero dollars to dispose of chemical manufacturing waste because it can be dumped into a hole in the ground, or the ocean, for basically "free". The point when we realise it certainly did have a cost is when for example that waste eventually comes back to poison people en masse, and governments, not the corporations,  spend millions or billions of dollars to fix the mess. There is always, ALWAYS, a cost, but corporations work hard to make sure it is borne by everyone else, whilst they run off with the profits.

VVideo: Despite the name \u201ccanned air\u201d, computer duster isn\u2019t oxygen at all. It\u2019s actually 1,1-Difluoroethane kept under pressure in its liquid form and released as a freezing cold gas. It can cause moderate frostbite.

Wait, what?\u000a\u000aThe easy hypothesis is that the temperature difference between boiling water and liquid 1,1-Difluoroethane causes the duster to rapidly and violently covert into its gaseous state. But TheBackyardScientist gave the same experiment a shot with liquid nitrogen and liquid butane. No dice. To make matters stranger, butane has an even lower boiling point than duster. So what gives? The Backyard Scientist speculates it has something to do with duster and water both being polar molecules, while nitrogen and butane are not. I\u2019m no scientist, backyard or otherwise.

VACTIVEON\u2019s solar powered camera, the SOLAR X Launching at CES in Last Vegas this week is this new solar powered camera from ACTIVEON. Called the SOLAR X, it offers 4K performance and includes a two-inch touchscreen, built-in 1100mAh rechargeable battery, built-in Wi-Fi and digital image stabilisation. It captures 4K video at 2160p with a 16 megapixel CMOS video sensor and also includes a seven-element F/2.4 high precision bright glass lens that provides four different levels of field of view. The SOLAR X boasts a graphical menu-driven interface allowing a user to toggle between video and photo modes. As a digital camera, it can shoot 16MP images with a burst rate of six frames per second. By connecting to its the solar panel case, the X Station, the panels absorb and store energy from the sun to charge the SOLAR X. Utilising the Burst Speed Charging technology, the X Station is able to charge the SOLAR X camera up to 80% in 30 minutes and to 100% in 60 minutes. This provides a total battery life of six hours; two hours from the built-in battery and an additional four hours with a fully charged X Station. ACTIVEON SOLAR X, CX GOLD, and CX action cameras have an iOS and Android smartphone app for easily controlling the cameras\u2019 functions, monitor live video, and share content directly to social media. When connected to Wi-Fi, the SOLAR X and CX Gold can automatically upload content to the ACTIVEON Cloud. In terms of connections, The SOLAR X has a micro HDMI output and is also compatible with nearly 40 additional accessories including eight different mounts, seven grips, selfie sticks, diving glasses and a Wi-Fi remote. Says Frank Donato, Executive Vice President of ACTIVEON: \u201cWe\u2019ve designed the SOLAR X to be like nothing else in the market today, with a slender profile, a lens system protected by smooth, toughened glass, and a unique recharging system that uses the sun itself to recharge its battery. So even if you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere, you can keep recording your adventures.\u201d ACTIVEON expects the action camera market to nearly double in size in the next two years, to nearly 20 million units annually. The SOLAR X is expected to reach retail stores in the UK in March 2016.

V Sphere\u2019s BB-8 bot was one of the coolest toys to come out of the Star Wars: Force Awakens glut last year. It was a minuature version of the little dude from the movie, but controlled by your phone (and hackable via Sphero\u2019s other apps). But now the BB-8 bot is all grungy looking and can be controlled with the FORCE.\u000a So it is eminently cooler than last year\u2019s model. Force control is achieved via Sphero\u2019s new Force Band, a wristicle that stays on your arm thanks to magnets in the clasp. According to Sphero, manipulating the BB-8 is as simple as a wave of your hand \u2014 we\u2019ll confirm that when we review it next week. In addition to bot control the Force Band also lets you engage in some Force exercises though a program called Force Awareness, that finds collectible holocrons as you roam around and uses the Band\u2019s haptic feedback to help you locate and collect them. And if your mouth is broken you can activate the Combat Mode, which makes all the whoosh whoosh noises you need for lightsaber duels. The Force Band is available from major retailers starting September 30 and will go for $US80 ($106). A Special Edition bundle, that bundles the Force Band with a BB-8 will retail for $US200 ($266). We\u2019ll have our own review of both devices soon. [Sphero]

VCoasting downhill on your bike is exhilarating \u2014 until, seconds later, it becomes terrifying. Experienced cyclists have a few tricks to keep those downhill rides safe, even when they\u2019re blazingly fast.\u000a\u000aPhoto by Jake Brewer. Cyclocross champion Tim Johnson described some of those tips to the New York Times. He coached Gwen Jorgensen, a triathlete who overcame a fear of downhills to win the US\u2019s first triathlon gold medal in Rio. The most important thing, he says, is to keep your gaze on the road far ahead of you, constantly scanning the terrain so you have plenty of warning for any potholes or sudden turns. The way you sit matters, too: Inexperienced riders will often lock their elbows and put all their weight on their handlebars. It\u2019s better to keep your weight on your feet, and only use your hands lightly. Check out the link below for more on how to speed down a hill without losing control.

VOn 10 April 1940, British submarine HMS Tarpon and its crew of 50 were sent to Norway to intercept Nazi merchant vessels. They were was never heard from again. Now, after 76 years, the sub has finally been found. An investigation of the remarkably well preserved vessel shows it didn\u2019t go down without a fight.\u000a\u000aA T-class submarine similar to the HMS Tarpon. (Image: S. J. Beadell/Imperial War Museums) The wreck was discovered earlier this year by Gert Normann Andersen, who runs a Danish war museum, and Innes McCartney, a British marine archaeologist. The shattered remains of the vessel, a 84m T-class submarine of the Royal Navy, was found in the Danish section of the North Sea, about 80m from the harbour town of Thyborøn. The discovery solves a longstanding mystery as to the exact location of the wreck, but historians know exactly what happened to the HMS Tarpon. A sonogram shows the HMS Tarpon \u2014 resting nearly upright \u2014 at the bottom of the North Sea. (Image: JD-Contractor A/S) The submarine was dispatched from Rosyth, Fife, in order to attack German merchant ships that were supplying arms to Nazi-occupied Norway. German war records show that the British sub attacked the Q-ship Schiff 40/Schürbek, but its torpedoes missed their mark. The German ship then managed to pick up the Tarpon on its sonar, and its periscope was spotted. The Schürbek dropped batches of depth charges in a sustained attack that lasted the duration of the morning. Finally, a calculated series of depth charges struck the ill-fated submarine, causing debris to float to the surface. Fifty British crewmen were killed in the attack. Remarkably, the wreck of the Tarpon still bears witness to this account. Danish divers who recently visited the site observed open hatches, shattered glass in the periscope, and severe destruction below the tower where the depth charge struck. McCartney said the damage was so severe behind the conning tower that \u201cit would have flooded in seconds\u201c. Also, two of the sub\u2019s torpedo tubes were empty, showing that the Tarpon did in fact engage the Schürbek in battle. And incredibly, the divers observed a crater on the seabed, which was formed by one of the powerful depth charges.  Today, the Tarpon sits almost upright under 40m of water. The challenge now, say its discoverers, is to protect the historic site from threats, such as fishing trawlers and illegal metal reclaimers. In respect for the dead, no further diving missions are planned. [Guardian]

VIt might not turn you into the next David Bailey but Olloclip promises to transform your mobile photography and social media posts with the all-new Active Lens for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Packed with both Ultra-Wide and Telephoto lenses, the Active Lens works on both the front and rear facing cameras and clips on and off the iPhone in seconds \u2013 without the need for extra parts like a bulky case or mounting bracket. Included are three wearable pendants to keep Active Lens easily accessible on a keychain, backpack, handbag \u2011 or anywhere within reach. A brand new Ultra-Wide Lens gives the iPhone a wider \u201caction camera\u201d field of view for everything from panoramic landscapes to a group selfie on the front FaceTime camera while the Telephoto Lens offers a 2x optical zoom to get twice as close to the action or create portraits with a shallower depth of field. Like lenses used on larger professional DSLR cameras, the Olloclip Active Lens system is designed specifically for iPhone to provide similar perspectives and is sized small enough to fit in a pocket, purse or hand. Says Patrick O\u2019Neill, CEO and founder of Olloclip: \u201cSize matters.  The real challenge is introduced when innovating quality optics in a compact and lightweight form factor.\u201d He adds: \u201cThat\u2019s why at olloclip we\u2019ve created a collection of beautifully designed, easy-to-use mobile lens systems with no oversized, heavy lenses or the need for extra parts like a bulky case or mounting bracket \u2011 just the way a mobile photographer would expect it.\u201d Made in the USA and designed in Huntington Beach, California, Olloclip\u2019s Active Lens retails for £89.99 and is now available for pre-order on http://www.olloclip.com.

VAfter more than a year of speculation, Apple\u2019s new iPhones are finally here. Predictably named the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple\u2019s twin gadgets are glass-and-aluminium reflections of what has come before. But in the few places where Apple does makes some changes, it makes them count.\u000a\u000aFor the first time ever, the new iPhone sticks with a mostly familiar design for a third year running. But despite that exterior sameness, Apple makes a gutsy gamble on improving, and completely removing, core features that have been part of the iPhone for nearly a decade. And yeah, it also comes in glossy black. For better or worse, this is the 2016 iPhone. As is tradition, Jony Ive delivered a wonderfully psychotic video to introduce the new iPhone, focusing on the new gloss finish and the redesigned camera housing. Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller then ran down all the changes live on stage. At 7.1mm, the iPhone 7 is actually the same thickness as the iPhone 6s. First up was design, Schiller confirmed what we already knew. Space Grey is out and Black is in. Apple also completely redesigned the home button, which has been the sole navigational key on the iPhone since 2007. Schiller says the new button is more reliable and customisable. And thanks to a new generation taptic engine, the button is now Force Touch sensitive. The new generation of the tech now provides unique feedback for messages, notifications and ringtones. Apple was a little vague exactly how this all works, but we\u2019ll know more soon. And a much needed feature is also here \u2014 the iPhone is now toilet proof. Apple says its re-engineered the casing so that the phone can survive most H20 plunges. And many accident-prone people rejoiced. Apple focused heavily on remaking the two camera systems in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Each phone now comes with optical image stabilisation and an f/1.8 aperture lens for much better low-light photography (hopefully). Apple also reworked the flash to make it brighter and able to capture truer tones and its image processor for better editing. With iOS 10, you can finally capture RAW photos and the front-facing camera comes with a 7-megapixel sensor, an upgrade from 5 megapixels on the iPhone 6s. Finally, Schiller gets to the much-anticipated dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus. It turns out one is a normal lens and the other a telephoto lens. Schiller explains that this new camera system can build a zoom feature into the iPhone. When in the camera app, a new button can zoom 2x instantly with just a tap. After 2x, however, further zoom relies on software. But because of the added telephoto lens, the zoomed in images are much clearer than before. The dual camera can uses machine learning to create a depth map. After selecting the camera app\u2019s new \u201cportrait\u201d mode, you\u2019ll immediately see the depth effect in real time. We didn\u2019t really get to see the effect in real time, but the photographic results Schiller did show looked damn good. Like the iPhone 6s the iPhone 7 can shoot in 4K at 30 fps, refuting some rumours suggesting that Apple might up the frame rate to 60. Oh well. As you\u2019ve likely guessed, Apple is sticking with an LCD Retina display, though much like the Apple Watch Series 2, it\u2019s a much brighter display. Then finally, Schiller got to the giant elephant in the room \u2014 audio. Apple couched the impending bad news by first talking about improved stereo speakers. Then came the Lightning-only EarPods. Goodbye, headphone jack. Schiller made certain we knew that there were over 900 million Lightning-connected devices from companies like JBL. But what if I wanted to use my headphones on, say, not an iPhone 7? Luckily, Apple will be including an audio jack adaptor in every box for the iPhone 7. Get prepared to lose it! Schiller quickly began to explain the madness: \u201cThe reason to move on comes down to one word \u2014 courage,\u201d Schiller explained. \u201cThis is really important, our smartphones are packed with technologies\u2026it\u2019s all fighting for space. Maintaining an ancient analogue connector doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Courage\u2026 (eye roll.) Apple says its vision for audio will be wireless. Hence, Apple AirPods. Apple\u2019s new ear gear will work for up to five hours on a single charge. When you open the case, the iPhone immediately recognises the AirPods. All you have to do is press \u201cconnect\u201d. Schiller says this is all possible because of a new chip called the W1. The AirPods can be set up so one pod answers calls or summons Siri and the sound is intelligently routed to the right ear when needed. In addition to the AirPods, Beats will also use the W1 chip in the new Beats Solo Wireless, Powerbeats 3 Wireless and a new line called Beats X. The AirPods will be available in late October, starting at $229. These are NOT coming in the box. Finally, Schiller closed up things with the new A10 Fusion chip. It\u2019s a 64-bit quad-core processor. Two cores are high-performance, so they can run 40 per cent faster than the chip on the iPhone 6s and twice as fast as the chip the iPhone 6. If you want to keep playing this game, it\u2019s 120 times faster than the original 2007 iPhone. The other cores are \u201chigh-efficiency\u201d to handle lighter applications for better battery life. The new graphics chip is also 50 per cent faster than the iPhone 6s. Schiller says you can get LTE browsing on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus at 12 and 13 hours respectively, which is around 2 hours better than the iPhone 6s. Not bad. Of course, these are all just numbers. Hopefully these impressive specs and curated demos translate to actually impressive real-world use. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will arrive at the same price as the iPhone 6S, starting at $1079 and $1269. Apple has also doubled the storage at each price point, starting with 32GB and going all the way to 256GB. Even old iPhone 6s models will get the storage upgrades. Orders start this Friday on September 9 and will arrive on September 16. iOS 10 will be pushed out to all devices on September 13.

VWe all have things that we want to achieve in our lives \u2014 getting into the better shape, building a successful business, raising a wonderful family, writing a best-selling book, winning a championship and so on.\u000a\u000aThis post originally appeared on JamesClear.com. And for most of us, the path to those things starts by setting a specific and actionable goal. At least, this is how I approached my life until recently. I would set goals for classes I took, for weights that I wanted to lift in the gym and for clients I wanted in my business. What I\u2019m starting to realise, however, is that when it comes to actually getting things done and making progress in the areas that are important to you, there is a much better way to do things. It all comes down to the difference between goals and systems. Let me explain. What\u2019s the difference between goals and systems? Now for the really interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still get results? For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get results? I think you would. As an example, I just added up the total word count for the articles I\u2019ve written this year. (You can see them all here.) In the last 12 months, I\u2019ve written over 115,000 words. The typical book is about 50,000 to 60,000 words, so I have written enough to fill two books this year. All of this is such a surprise because I never set a goal for my writing. I didn\u2019t measure my progress in relation to some benchmark. I never set a word count goal for any particular article. I never said, \u201cI want to write two books this year.\u201d What I did focus on was writing one article every Monday and Thursday. And after sticking to that schedule for 11 months, the result was 115,000 words. I focused on my system and the process of doing the work. In the end, I enjoyed the same (or perhaps better) results. Let\u2019s talk about three more reasons why you should focus on systems instead of goals. When you\u2019re working toward a goal, you are essentially saying, \u201cI\u2019m not good enough yet, but I will be when I reach my goal.\u201d The problem with this mindset is that you\u2019re teaching yourself to always put happiness and success off until the next milestone is achieved. \u201cOnce I reach my goal, then I\u2019ll be happy. Once I achieve my goal, then I\u2019ll be successful.\u201d Solution: Commit to a process, not a goal. Choosing a goal puts a huge burden on your shoulders. Can you imagine if I had made it my goal to write two books this year? Just writing that sentence stresses me out. But we do this to ourselves all the time. We place unnecessary stress on ourselves to lose weight or to succeed in business or to write a best-selling novel. Instead, you can keep things simple and reduce stress by focusing on the daily process and sticking to your schedule, rather than worrying about the big, life-changing goals. When you focus on the practice instead of the performance, you can enjoy the present moment and improve at the same time. You might think your goal will keep you motivated over the long-term, but that\u2019s not always true. Consider someone training for a half-marathon. Many people will work hard for months, but as soon as they finish the race, they stop training. Their goal was to finish the half-marathon and now that they have completed it, that goal is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This can create a type of \u201cyo-yo effect\u201d where people go back and forth from working on a goal to not working on one. This type of cycle makes it difficult to build upon your progress for the long-term. Solution: Release the need for immediate results. I was training at the gym last week and I was doing my second-to-last set of clean and jerks. When I hit that rep, I felt a small twinge in my leg. It wasn\u2019t painful or an injury, just a sign of fatigue near the end of my workout. For a minute or two, I thought about doing my final set. Then, I reminded myself that I plan to do this for the rest of my life and decided to call it a day. In a situation like the one above, a goal-based mentality will tell you to finish the workout and reach your goal. After all, if you set a goal and you don\u2019t reach it, then you feel like a failure. But with a systems-based mentality, I had no trouble moving on. Systems-based thinking is never about hitting a particular number, it\u2019s about sticking to the process and not missing workouts. Of course, I know that if I never miss a workout, then I will lift bigger weights in the long-run. And that\u2019s why systems are more valuable than goals. Goals are about the short-term result. Systems are about the long-term process. In the end, process always wins. You can\u2019t predict the future. (I know, shocking.) But every time we set a goal, we try to do it. We try to plan out where we will be and when we will make it there. We try to predict how quickly we can make progress, even though we have no idea what circumstances or situations will arise along the way. Solution: Build feedback loops. Each Friday, I spend 15 minutes filling out a small spreadsheet with the most critical metrics for my business. For example, in one column I calculate the conversion rate (the percentage of website visitors that join my free email newsletter each week). I rarely think about this number, but checking that column each week provides a feedback loop that tells me if I\u2019m doing things right. When that number drops, I know that I need to send high quality traffic to my site. Feedback loops are important for building good systems because they allow you to keep track of many different pieces without feeling the pressure to predict what is going to happen with everything. Forget about predicting the future and build a system that can signal when you need to make adjustments. None of this is to say that goals are useless. However, I\u2019ve found that goals are good for planning your progress and systems are good for actually making progress. Goals can provide direction and even push you forward in the short-term, but eventually a well-designed system will always win. Having a system is what matters. Committing to the process is what makes the difference. Forget About Setting Goals. Focus on This Instead. [James Clear] Image by Divergent (Shutterstock). This article ignores the biochemical reactions in all of us that are centred around a reward/achievement cycle. You set, complete and tick of the task - your get a dopamine rush.  Although it say's to only focus on the system - without a destination (goal) framing the process everyday, you can loose focus and direction pretty easily. Even the last paragraph mentions they are important to keep focus, he's just not letting on we need to check in with them more to keep that focus.  I prefer functioning with the thought that - we are only productive to the degree of motivation stirred by our ambitions.  Goals are the 'what' > process, plans, systems and strategy are the 'how'. This guy sounds like he would be a weapon if he learnt to use goals in a different way. But perhaps he has an aversion to the airy-fairy way in which the word 'goals' have been hijacked by personal-development coaches. Which admittedly makes me cringe.

VYou know who deserves to get free things? Poor people.\u000a But in the twisted capitalist dystopia we live in, rich people are often the beneficiaries of the sweetest free goods. The latest instance of injustice? Kendall Jenner \u2014 whose net worth is reportedly around $US10 ($13) million \u2014 has just received a year of free rides on Lyft, after her sister Kim Kardashian complained the supermodel had been banned from Uber. Ugh I have to drive @KendallJenner around tonight bc she's banned from Uber! Why @Uber?!?! She's a "model" passenger!!!!! \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) August 27, 2016  An Uber source told Entertainment Tonight that Jenner hadn\u2019t been banned, but that her account had been temporarily put on hold because of a minor issue. Before Uber could win one of its most famous customers back, Lyft offered Jenner free rides for a year. The supermodel thanked Uber\u2019s competitor for its generosity on her Snapchat channel. thanks lyft! pic.twitter.com/ijfk37nNM3 \u2014 Kendall (@IkendollJennerI) September 3, 2016  Kim Kardashian is currently living rent-free in a New York City Airbnb that\u2019s on the market for $US25 ($33) million. None of this is fair, at all, and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. ¯\u005c_(\u30c4)_/¯ [TMZ via Mashable] Let's play this out.  A model like Kendall Jenner, according to a quick Google search charges between $125k-$300k per endorsement post. Let's assume she'd charge $125k since is a 10 sec update on Snapchat so it commands the bottom end of the fee.  A ride on Lyft Plus from Hollwood Blvd, LA to LAX International Airport costs about $85. $125,000/$85: 1,470 rides per year Assuming Ms Jenner uses Lyft twice a day, 365 days a year at $100 per trip: $73,000. Cost to Lyft (to pay the drivers less their own commission, -25%): $54,750 Poor people may deserve free things, but it seems to me Lyft got the better end of the bargain by getting brownie points, viral marketing and talkability, and a popular celebrity endorsement at 43% of the cost. "there\u2019s nothing we can do about it." I find it hard to believe that's your view, given the fact you wrote this article? And did a grand total of nothing about it. Surely the first step in fixing a social problem is telling people there's a social problem? But this is an economic one. I see it's time to apply rule 14. Not Hanlon's razor? Company offers supermodel incentive as part of PR, let's all cry that life isn't fair. Release a sex tape and in ten years or so you might get free lifts for your family too.

VFacebook\u2019s trending news module is making headlines again, and this time it\u2019s for propping up 9/11 truther nonsense as \u201cnews\u201d. Instead of simply removing the offending article, however, the platform has now dropped the trending topic \u2014 broadly titled \u201cSeptember 11th Anniversary\u201d \u2014 altogether.  As multiple people noted on Twitter today, the top story in the \u201cSeptember 11th Anniversary\u201d tab in the trending news section was a Daily Star story that carried the headline, \u201cSeptember 11: The footage that \u2018proves bombs were planted in the Twin Towers.'\u201d  The piece, which is still accessible on the tabloid\u2019s website, devotes many words to describing a well-known 9/11 truther theory \u2014 that the towers were brought down by intentionally planted bombs rather than planes. Facebook removed human editors. (https://t.co/PdljXr2Cry) Now it is telling me 9/11 was caused by bombs, not planes. pic.twitter.com/X7Ug9khNVR \u2014 Jessica Contrera (@mjcontrera) September 9, 2016  The article is based upon \u2014 and can also be seen as an attempt to legitimise \u2014 a nonsense conspiracy theory. But that didn\u2019t stop it from ending up front and centre on the trending news tab, where it was likely seen by thousands of people before it was eventually removed by Facebook. \u201cWe\u2019re aware a hoax article showed up there,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman told the Washington Post today, \u201cand as a temporary step to resolving this we\u2019ve removed the topic.\u201d According to the Post, the article alone initially \u201cdisappeared\u201d from the topic page and was replaced by a different story. Eventually, however, Facebook removed the topic from the trending section altogether \u2014 a move they further confirmed when Gizmodo asked what, exactly, had been removed. \u201cPer the statement, we\u2019ve removed the topic,\u201d a spokesman said. Later on Friday afternoon, another similar topic \u2014 September 11 Memorials and Services \u2014 began trending. Its top story was a piece from Time with the headline, \u201cThis Is How The World Is Remembering 9/11.\u201d Still, Facebook\u2019s earlier decision brings up more questions than answers. Why remove a topic wholesale, rather than simply nix the problematic hoax article at the top? The Washington Post noted that Facebook originally replaced the Daily Star piece with another story; that suggests people were talking about other 9/11-related stories besides the Daily Star\u2018s. Why go one step further and get rid of the topic in its entirety? Facebook\u2019s apparent manipulation with what\u2019s trending brings to mind the \u201cblacklisting\u201d tool that human curators were able to use before the team was fired last month and replaced with engineers.  Since then, the algorithm has spit out a fake news story which labelled Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly a \u201ctraitor\u201d and pieces about people copulating with sandwiches, among other things. Now, it seems, Facebook has taken to deleting trending topics wholesale. We\u2019ve asked Facebook for more detail on the decision to remove the topic page and we\u2019ll update if we hear back.

VYesterday, the US FAA told Gizmodo it was \u201cworking on guidance\u201d concerning Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7 amid reports of the devices exploding when charged, but at least one Australian airline appears to have already taken action, The Sydney Morning Herald reports.\u000a\u000aPhoto: Reddit.com/Crushader According to customer Dean Cabena, Qantas crew members warned passengers that charging the Note 7 was prohibited during a flight from Perth to Sydney this week. @latikambourke Qantas made announcement on flight today\u2026no charging Samsung Note 7 on plane \u2014 Dean Cabena (@dcabena77) September 6, 2016  A Qantas spokesperson later confirmed that the airline was asking customers not to charge the smartphones in the air, telling the Herald, \u201cFollowing the worldwide recall of the Samsung Galaxy Note7 Personal Electronic Device (PED), we are requesting that passengers do not charge them inflight.\u201d So far, Samsung has offered refunds and exchanges for customers who bought the Note 7. However, it has yet to coordinate an official recall in the US with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. If they had, officials say the smartphone\u2019s batteries would be banned from passenger-carrying aircraft under FAA rules. [SMH] I am fairly certain that all airlines are currently phasing this in. I work as a flight attendant here in australia for a domestic carrier, and we now have to announce on the flight prior to departure that the Note7 is not allowed on the flight. The passenger must turn it off, and not allowed to charge it. Why don't they also just ask people not to explode their bottles of water instead of prohibiting them on the flight too? Well this really just bring home that we won't be seeing any snarky, 'The next big thing is already here' ads from Samsung this year to coo side with the iPhone launch.

p998
VLenovo\u2019s Yoga Book is, hands down, the most interesting and innovative gadget that I got hands-on time with at the IFA 2016 trade show in Berlin this week, at an event where everything purports to be innovative. In the same way that the original Microsoft Surface Pro revolutionised the hybrid tablet-laptop world, the Yoga Book is the next evolution of that, with a keyboard that isn\u2019t a keyboard but instead an entirely touch-sensitive panel.  Built around Lenovo\u2019s now-familiar watchband hinge, the same one that debuted on the 360-degree Yoga 3 Pro, the new Yoga Book can switch between tablet and laptop mode with the flick of a wrist. But, unlike most other 2-in-1s, you\u2019ll actually want to use the Yoga Book in tablet mode as much as you will as in laptop. There are three reasons for this. First is that Lenovo is smart enough to offer the Yoga Book both with Android \u2014 that tablet-friendly OS that can double duty as a laptop OS if needed \u2014 and with Windows 10 \u2014 friendlier as a laptop than a tablet, but versatile in the other direction instead. This is a big dealcl, and it\u2019s one that we\u2019re only ever used to seeing from Lenovo. Lenovo clearly gets that people use 2-in-1s in different ways depending on whether they\u2019re primarily business or leisure users. The second is that amazing non-keyboard. Lenovo calls it the Halo, and it\u2019s a touch-sensitive panel \u2014 not an entire second screen, but a flat panel that has a digitiser \u2014 that can light up with a LED-backlit keyboard layout if you need it to. It\u2019s ridiculous how well it works, too, either for short typing sessions or impromptu drawing. I\u2019m more of a typist than an artist, and I didn\u2019t mind dashing off a quick email on the Yoga Book, but I loved an equally quick sketch with the bundled digitiser pen. The third, but not least, is just the design of the Yoga Book. It just hits all the right points for a casual user to carry around with them all day. It\u2019s a 10-inch device, that perfect tablet size that has me so in love with the iPad Pro (I\u2019m sorry for this temporary affair with Lenovo, Apple.) It\u2019s less than a centimetre thick when closed. And that hinge makes it genuinely easy to switch between modes whenever the need or want arises. The hardware inside promises over a dozen hours of battery. The Yoga Book is not a super-premium device, but instead affordable \u2014 at $US499 for an Android version and $US549 for one running Windows 10, with effectively the same hardware stack on both running a low-power Intel Atom x5 processor and 4GB of RAM along 64GB of solid-state storage. And that\u2019s what makes it so exciting; it\u2019s a new and different gadget, but not one priced out of the reach of the masses. I\u2019m looking forward to spending a lot more time with the Yoga Book in the future. [Lenovo] Nice concept. My biggest concern would be the hinge. Even top of the line laptops such as Apple Macbook Pro or HP the hinge eventually start to be somewhat loose. The hinge on this product will be constantly moved. I hope they have a process for getting it replaced. This is a nice looking piece of kit. It will be interesting to see how it fares performance wise, though the 4gb of RAM sounds nice. What!?! I've never so much as heard of a laptop's hinge becoming loose. If the lid didn't stay where you put it, the laptop would become useless. Even my 2008 Dell M4400's lid stays exactly where you put it. When I first saw an article about this, I thought it might be pretty good but then I realised that when I am using any of my graphics applications, I always need one hand on the keyboard to change tools or resize brushes. For that reason, an either/or keyboard/drawing tablet just wouldn't work. Putting Atom into it, instead of Core M, is also a bit of a disappointment. Campbell, why do you find 10" the sweet spot? For me it is too big for a tablet. I've always figured if I have to physically carry it around, I may as well just take my laptop. That's why I prefer a smaller tablet that I can put in my jacket or shorts pocket. I bought a 10.1" Yoga 2 tablet last year. It's a very cool gadget but I found I never used it so I replaced it a few months ago with the 8" version. That gets heaps more use and, unlike my phone, I don't find I have to compromise on anything because of the smaller screen. There are different definition of sweet spot in different form factor due to the fact that screen size will affect the size of the keyboard or touch screen keyboard panel in this case .\u000aAnd several factors such as Operating system. If its a screen only tablet aka ipad , or galaxy tabs , in my opinion 9.7 inches is the perfect size 10.1inches is still good but 9.7 inches is the way to go for the extra portability . 0.4 inch might sounds nothing on the paper , but if you do the real math you'll realize 0.4 inch gap is quite noticeable for object of this size .  10.1 inch keyboard typing experience is bad  , you may refer to reviews of asus t100 for my claims , anything smaller than that will make it terrible . So it make sense for the design of Lenovo Yoga book to be 10.1 inch or maybe fiddle around with the screen size abit to find the sweetspot .  And lastly is the operating system. Apple OS or Android OS both works fine for any screen size ranging from 3.5 inchs to any inches  , but in order to use Windows 10 effectively a screen 10.1 inches or above is required Well and for the processor , I kind of agree and disagree with you .The main reason to use Atom instead of Core M is due to the fact that one of the Yoga book variant runs on Android OS which only intel atom is compatible to run it . Another reason which is to keep the cost low . But I can't deny the fact that in Windows 10 we really need that extra processing power from intel core M  , just so much more we can do on the tablet with intel core m , slightly more intensive gaming for example , with intel core M watching Dota 2 replays will be a viable option on this tablet . On the android version counterpart atom processor is an excellent choice . \u000a									Last edited September 6, 2016 11:46 pm
