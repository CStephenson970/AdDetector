VWe asked readers for questions about Windows Azure to put to Microsoft, and you came up with some great responses. Tim Buntel, product manager for the Windows Azure platform at Microsoft Australia, has all the answers. Read on!  There\u2019s so much happening in the cloud computing area nowadays, and Windows Azure just seems like Microsoft\u2019s version of Amazon Web Services. I notice that Azure is coined as \u201cplatform as a service\u201d. Can you walk us through the differences? Amazon Web Services are generally considered \u201cinfrastructure as a service\u201d. Both Infrastructure and platform as a service are public cloud offerings to deliver computing resources. The difference lies in the level of abstraction provided by each. The Windows Azure platform abstracts most of the operating system level details and allows you to focus on the application itself. It provides services for the kinds of things you need to develop for every type of application, from consumer web to enterprise, such as compute and storage, access control, caching, a CDN, and business intelligence based on SQL Server among others. Infrastructure as a service provides a virtual computing environment into which you deploy virtual machines that will run your application. These machine images are just like real servers which you need to administer from the operating-system up including user and account management, patches and updates, and so on. With Windows Azure, you build and deploy applications; with IaaS, you build and deploy machine images in which applications can run.  What can Azure do for a small business that Office 365 can\u2019t? We have a small consultancy that uses Sharepoint, Outlook and Lync from Office 365. I\u2019m really glad to hear that you\u2019re using Office 365! It\u2019s a great way for organisations to use the familiar Microsoft productivity applications that power so many successful businesses without having to spend time and money on physical infrastructure, security and reliability. What Office 365 is not is an application development platform. Windows Azure allows you to build, host and scale applications in Microsoft datacentres. For example, you might use Azure for a custom database application that helps you manage and report on inventory and sales. I have an idea for a cloud-based application that involves uploading and storing large images. I\u2019m not a programmer, but all kinds of cloud complexities come to mind in modelling this \u2013 bandwidth usage, upload timeouts, optimal use of HTML5 browser local storage, etc. Where can I go to get advice on modelling a practical structure within Azure to best handle this? Windows Azure offers a Binary Large Object (BLOB) Service which is the simplest way to store text or binary data (like images or other media files) with Windows Azure. There are many helpful resources available to learn more about it. A good start is here, which provides an overview of storing and accessing data in Windows Azure. I\u2019d also recommend taking a look at the tutorial on using the BLOB service. MSDN has heaps of tutorials and other learning content including downloads to free tools to help get you started. Finally, you might want to consider working with a Microsoft partner who can provide expertise to you directly. My organisation currently hosts a large MS SQL database, and a web app that uses stored procedures on the DB. We offer this as a SaaS model for our clients. The database handles approximately 1,000,000 new records per day. My concern with moving this type of application to the cloud is around speed and scalability. Can you please give some real life examples of very high volume applications that are using Azure, and outline how to determine whether Azure is appropriate for high transaction applications like ours? There are many case studies available that illustrate how companies have been successful with the Azure platform \u2014 check them out.  for all of them. One that comes to mind is online ticket-seller Flavours \u2013 they can handle selling 150,000 tickets every 10 seconds!  We also recently announced that Azure will be adding support for Hadoop; a great platform for analyzing unstructured data or large volumes of data \u2013 read the blog post  for an overview.  There\u2019s also a whitepaper available  on creating high-performance SQL Azure applications that would be helpful.  How do I use SSIS with the Azure implementation of SQL Server? For those who aren\u2019t familiar with it, SSIS is SQL Server Integration Services; a component of SQL Server that can connect and transform disparate data sources. SQL Azure does not include SSIS, however, depending on what you\u2019re trying to do, you might find the SQL Azure Data Sync service useful. It allows you to synchronize data across on-premises implementations and Azure. Watch the video at this link for an overview.  In this video, James Coenen-Eyre explains how Azure has transformed his development process.

V Remember that leaked footage of Kyle Vandercamp that rudely interrupted Good Game last week? Well, we\u2019ve got some more info, and we need your help in putting it together. Kyle Vandercamp has been exposed as a whistleblower on Bluebird \u2013 a rogue R&D project in geoengineering funded by billionaire Harrison Wyld. Kyle\u2019s set up a Stop Bluebird campaign and leaked documents about the Bluebird project, with the help of Lulu Rich (pictured) and Juanita Monte. And now, they need our help as well. Kyle, Lulu and Juanita have created the Dashboard Collective wiki, where you can help decode and unlock these leaked files, and be one step closer to figuring out what the hell this is all about. And the sooner the better. Yesterday afternoon, the masterminds behind Bluebird initiated a counter-attack with a Go Bluebird campaign. Unbelievable. It\u2019s crazy to think that a project of this magnitude, with such serious ethical consequences, could launch without anyone\u2019s knowledge\u2026

V<br />\u000avar noskimwords = true;<br />\u000a\u000aSponsored post\u000a\u000aIt has long been argued that the pace of technological invention will eventually slow; that the exponential growth we have witnessed over the last 100 years will peter out; and that eventually we will reach a period of stagnation at which point no significant discoveries or breakthroughs will be made. Happily, this fairly depressing vision of mankind\u2019s future appears (at least at present) to be confined to the realms of science fiction; if anything our rate of progress has increased even further. The Internet, for example, has been relentlessly improved, with greater speed and coverage and the invention of wireless networks. Computers and mobile phones have also been the focal points of massive development and innovation over the last 10 years. Amid all this change, development, progress and innovation there is one company which has emerged as the clear leader of the modern entertainment race: Apple. And the recent arrival of the iPad 2 has made this position even clearer. The iPad 2 has quite simply rendered many other gadgets obsolete; in this single tablet you are provided with a replacement for your phone, your MP3 player, your television and your laptop. Apple has invested a great deal of time and resources into ensuring that the iPad 2 surpasses its predecessor. The 9×7 inch lightweight device delivers excellent HD clarity and can easily be propped up to watch your favourite films or television programmes in bed, or while you\u2019re in the bath; it can even be placed on a treadmill when you\u2019re visiting the gym. Although HDTV is still relatively new, this hasn\u2019t stopped Apple from taking full advantage of this technology and creating a compact, portable screen that will rival the one in your living room. The iPad 2 runs faster and much more smoothly than the original iPad, which is great when you want to watch a film, TV programme on BBC iPlayer, or video on YouTube. The battery life is much improved too, Apple promises a 10-hour lifespan, perfect for spending the day relaxing and catching up with some of your favourite TV programmes. The iPad 2 automatically switches itself off at the end of a film if you don\u2019t select another, so you don\u2019t need to worry about the drain on the lifetime of your battery if you fall asleep, and this also means that your screen will not be damaged by screen burn-in. New apps are developed daily, and with the arrival of apps such as BBC iPlayer and YouTube, it seems that there isn\u2019t much you can watch on your TV that you can\u2019t watch on your iPad 2. If you\u2019re not in the mood to watch something, there are many gaming apps which are available and, of course, you can use your iPad 2 to play your favourite music. Due to the wide variety of and the excellent quality of the display, the iPad 2 is strong competition for any regular TV, MP3 player or laptop. That, teamed with the battery life (which is better than has ever been seen in a tablet), makes the iPad 2 a very popular method of entertainment consumption. By putting everything in one place the iPad 2 certianly is changing the way we consume entertainment. The winning feature, however, is the versatility of this simple and compact tablet; with the iPad 2, everything you need is right in front of you.

VWith the addition of the Lifestyle 135 Soundbar system to its lineup, Bose has developed a complete collection of home theatre setups for any type of room. Whether you\u2019re renting or renovating, Bose has a high quality home theatre setup for you. Bose has always offered premium audiovisual solutions for the home theatre, but before the release of the Lifestyle 135, there was always a segment of the market that couldn\u2019t enjoy the Bose Lifestyle. The addition of a soundbar offering to the range means that Bose now offers a complete suite of home theatre products, from the single speaker solution to 2.1, 5.1 and speaker-only systems. The Lifestyle 135 system is perfect for renters or anyone hoping for a richer home theatre experience with a minimum of effort. With a single visible speaker that wirelessly connects to an Acoustimass subwoofer, the Lifestyle 135 features a range of amazing technologies to deliver wide, immersive sound that fills a room. It features the groundbreaking FlexMount system that can adjust the sound output depending on whether the speaker is wall mounted or lying horizontally on your entertainment unit. For a superior stereo home theatre experience, Bose offers a range of 2.1 home theatre systems, led by the Lifestyle 235. With two Gemstone ES speakers, each with three drivers inside, the 235 system offers amazingly deep, immersive audio quality for the home. When coupled with Bose\u2019s clever Unity integration system, the Lifestyle 235 is simple to setup and will change the way you think about 2.1 systems forever. The Lifestyle family of systems explodes in the 5.1 space, where Bose offers six different home theatre products for the discerning audio lover. Leading the charge are the high-end Lifestyle V series systems, including the V35 and V25, The V35 is a top of the line option, which offers premium Jewel Cube speakers and connectivity for up to six different high definition components, plus Bose\u2019s intelligent Unify integration system and AdaptiQ easy setup.  Similarly, the Lifestyle V25 offers the same amazing connectivity and setup options as the V35, but offers the slightly larger, yet still impressively sounding, Direct/Reflecting speakers, all for a fraction of the cost.  For a more affordable option, the Lifestyle T20 offers many of Bose\u2019s high-end audio features, including the AdaptiQ and Unify setup system in a more affordable configuration, but without sacrificing quality. And those with large DVD collections will love the Lifestyle 48, Lifestyle 48F and Lifestyle 18 systems, which all integrate a DVD player into the control console for an all-in-one solution. The 48 and 48F also offer a huge hard drive for storing your music collection, while upscaling all video content to 1080p over HDMI. For those who want the benefits of a 5.1 system but are still cautious about running cables through the walls, Bose also has a range of intelligent accessories, including the SL2 Wireless Surround Link.

VThey are the shows that had us hooked, then abruptly ended after one lonely season. And now you can watch them anytime, anywhere on Stan.   Here\u2019s 10 of the best one season wonders, the stories that ended all too soon.   A 200 year old man (with a delightful British accent) works in the New York City Morgue trying to find a key to unlock the curse of his immortality. Probably deserved more than the 1 season it got and fans still live in hope #SaveForever  Based on the excellent DC Comics series, Constantine is a demon hunter, exorcist and master of the dark arts \u2014- with an attitude and charm that\u2019s hard to pass up.  Based in a more realistic TV high school than most, Freaks and Geeks launched the careers of some of the biggest names in comedy today. Jason Segal, James Franco and Seth Rogen to name a few. We\u2019re still hoping for a reunion -\u2013 Seth Rogen can still play a high schooler right?   Think 500 days of Summer meets How I Met Your Mother, plus it\u2019s got Cristin Miloti (the eventual mother from HIMYM). Tragically cut short, the series is more like A to M, but the writers fit a fair amount of charm into the resulting 13 episodes.  My Fair Lady for millenials. Karen Gillan sheds her Dr Who companion roots to turn into a vacuous sales executive obsessed with social media and herself. Fans loved it, critics were pleasantly surprised even despite the average show title (Selfie, really guys?)    Suffered from being a little too similar to HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley but the 1 season of this Amazon Original is a great watch and offers a fairly realistic view of startups, Silicon Valley and making it in tech.  From the creator if The Shield, a US sub receives an order for a nuke launch. The Captain refuses to fire, and the crew and SEALs take refuge on a small island. Then the real fun begins.  Hot Fuzz meets Haven, Aussie-style: A lighthearted, supernatural cop show set in a fictional Australian seaside community called Coolum. There\u2019s also a US remake in the works set to star Danny Pudi from Community.  The hilarious Little Britain team take to the skies, playing a range of characters you\u2019ll find when you fly. Despite being an enormous ratings success in the UK (and being offered a second season) the comedy duo decided not to continue with the series.  From the producers of Homeland and Heroes, Dig is the story of Peter, an FBI agent stationed in Jerusalem. While investigating a murder of a young female archaeologist he uncovers a conspiracy 2000 years in the making.

VIf you have a file server that is still running Windows XP, it\u2019s a massive security risk for your business. With the end of Microsoft\u2019s regular security patch schedule for XP, you won\u2019t have any protection against new vulnerabilities. If you upgrade to a business NAS to store your data, you\u2019ll be protected against intrusion and find a swathe of innovative and new features as well. Let\u2019s take a look.\u000a Synology\u2019s range of DiskStation network-attached storage (NAS) enclosures are fully-fledged mini-PCs, running Synology\u2019s in-house-developed DiskStation Manager operating system.  Unlike a beige box Windows PC, they\u2019re engineered specifically for business data storage, with easily accessible and hot-swappable 3.5-inch drive bays supporting disks from all major manufacturers. DiskStation Manager\u2019s Hybrid RAID lets you add additional storage when needed without requiring complicated procedures, adjusting storage volume sizes on the fly.   DiskStation Manager gives you all the functionality you\u2019d expect from a file server, with file-level permissions and support for access control lists and ADS domain support. You can set limits on user traffic and set quotas both on transfers and storage allocation. Easily installed apps, selected through the DiskStation Manager interface, let you add mail server, web server, VPN, DHCP control and other features when you need them. With smart energy management and low-power components like Intel\u2019s dual-core Atom processors, a NAS like Synology\u2019s DS713+ or DS1813+ can save you money on your electricity bills by entering a low-power state when it\u2019s not in use while still remaining accessible on your network. Once you have a Synology NAS set up, no ongoing maintenance is required.\u000a Multiple wired Ethernet LAN ports can be used for link aggregation to massively boost transfer rates for bandwidth-critical applications, or can be used for failover redundancy. Multiple USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports let administrators directly backup from or transfer files to a DiskStation with external storage.  Passive component and active low-noise fan cooling for internal hard drives means a DiskStation won\u2019t overheat or throttle its performance under heavy load. All of this comes with an energy footprint that is massively reduced from a conventional Windows PC file server. Synology\u2019s DiskStation NAS enclosures are scalable to suit anything from a small business to an enterprise, with a variety of 2-, 4-, 8-bay and larger configurations. DiskStation Manager offers a comprehensive feature-set of management and administration tools on all DiskStation NAS, so if you\u2019re running a small business but have demanding or specific storage needs you\u2019re covered.

p50
VThe Olympus OM-D E-M1 is a state-of-the-art compact system camera (also known as mirrorless), inheriting all of Olympus\u2019 77 years of expertise in crafting some of the best cameras ever made. It might look retro, but inside its shell you\u2019ll find a host of class-leading specifications \u2014 an ultra-modern imaging sensor, super-detailed electronic viewfinder and screen, and powerful user controls. And it may be small, but it\u2019s not certainly short on innovative features. With a host of useful extras inside, the E-M1 can do everything you want it to.    Perfect for painting with light, Olympus\u2019 Live Bulb mode captures a long exposure, but gives you a unique perspective: it shows you what you\u2019re painting, while you\u2019re painting it. The rear screen of the OM-D E-M1 updates as you\u2019re working, helping you make sure you\u2019ve got everything spot-on.  Live Time is just like Live Bulb, but shows you an updated long-exposure photo in the increments you set. You can point the camera at a night-time or low light landscape, hit the shutter, and see your photo develop in real time; when it looks the way you want it to, hit the shutter again and the photo is saved. Olympus has integrated an easy-to-use intervalometer feature in the OM-D E-M1, letting you set the camera up for a time lapse photography session. Click the shutter, and sit back. The intervalometer captures photos every few seconds, at the intervals you select \u2014 perfect for capturing sunrises, sunsets or other time lapse scenes. And once you\u2019re done, the E-M1 can even turn your photos into a time lapse movie, saving you time and effort. All you have to do is be at the right place at the right time \u2014 Olympus\u2019 new camera takes care of everything else. Got a smartphone? You can use the Olympus OI.Share app on Android and iOS to control every feature of the E-M1, including focusing, changing shooting settings and taking photos completely wirelessly. Built-in geotagging means you can keep track of your photos around the world. The OI.Share app also lets you use Olympus\u2019 innovative long exposure modes with the press of a finger. You can upload photos straight from the E-M1 to the Web using the OI.Share app, too, so you won\u2019t need to lug around a heavy computer when you\u2019re travelling \u2014 just use your phone or tablet instead, and share your photos with friends from on the road.  The OM-D EM-1\u2019s 5-axis in-body image stabilisation is the most advanced of its type ever used in a camera. The electronic sensor stops accidental camera movement vertically or horizontally, compensates for shaky hands and can even adjust for unintentional camera roll or tilt.  It\u2019s invaluable for taking photos, but makes hand-held movies using the E-M1\u2019s Full HD sensor look great too \u2014 movies are detailed, and free of any camera shake that might cause blur or judder.  The HDR effect built into the OM-D E-M1 captures stunning high-contrast and high-detail photos, with a single press of the shutter button. In HDR mode, the camera snaps four photos simultaneously, and stitches them together into a single frame, with increased dynamic range that can bring out detail that you never expected to see. Also built into the OM-D E-M1 is a Hand Held Starlight mode. Wait for a starry night, point the E-M1 at the sky and press the shutter button. The camera does the rest \u2014 it captures up to eight photos at once and stitches them together automatically, giving you a bright and detailed photo without the image noise usually seen in star photos. The Olympus OM-D E-M1 has all the history of the classic OM camera system, but there\u2019s nothing old-school about it.

The marketing machine behind Bluebird\u2019s new website does a great job of selling all the points on why we should go down the path of geoengineering. Go to www.gobluebird.net to check them out for yourself. On the other hand, the Stop Bluebird crew, who we met last week, have been setting up protest groups to stop Harrison\u2019s plans.

VCash flow is the lifeblood of every small business and can be the difference between businesses that survive and businesses that thrive. All businesses, no matter how big or small, face cash flow challenges \u2013 so it\u2019s no surprise that long-term success and business growth can be linked to the ability to meet short term expense needs. It can also be hard to track incomings when you\u2019re accepting payments in multiple forms \u2014 cash, credit and online.  Even an established business can have issues and decreased productivity when cash flow doesn\u2019t add up. Consider Lia Hairdressing, a company that was experiencing issues balancing the books at the end of the day, as final figures did not always match their receivables. This resulted in headaches for the business\u2019 bookkeeper and owners, with time spent on accounting that should have been a quick and easy process.  The answer for their company was to consolidate their transactional banking and merchant provider so that end of day takings could be easily matched. Bankwest Merchant Solutions allowed their business to do just that. Bankwest Business Merchant Solutions allows businesses to receive numerous forms of payments with one account. With the ability to accept payments in-store with Eftpos and Paypass, on-the-go with Eftpos Mobile, as well as online or over the phone using E-commerce facilities and products. Since switching to mobile Eftpos terminals with everyday settlement, Lia Hairdressing has had no issues with end-of-day figures. Settlement figures now match what is received in their business account, reducing work for the bookkeeper and allowing easy access to funds for outgoings.  What\u2019s more, the ability to see everything in one place can help get a clearer picture of your businesses financial health. Allowing more time to be spent running the business, instead of managing banking.  Suitable for a range of businesses, from cafes to hairdressers, hotels and theme parks, Bankwest\u2019s Business Merchant Solutions have a range of options to suit your business needs.

For more information on how to get the most out of your run, and ensure you get the perfect fit for your feet, chat to the experts at The Athlete\u2019s Foot When you\u2019re sacrificing your lunch break, it\u2019s more important then ever to ensure you\u2019re still getting enough nutrients to fuel your day. The best way to do this is also the simplest \u2014 pack it. Eat an apple (or other fruit) before you head out for some easily digestible and instant energy, then load up on carbs with a sandwich in the sunshine as you recover.  Work out how much time you have, then download an app like map my run. It will help you track your run, plan for personal bests, tell you calories burned \u2014 all which help you plan your precious lunch break minutes. Did you know that your foot is as unique as your fingerprint? Getting professionally fitted for running shoes is vital. You don\u2019t want to choose something just based on brand loyalty or looks \u2014 it won\u2019t work out well for you in the long run. Luckily the experts at The Athlete\u2019s Foot are on hand to make sure you get the perfect fit for your needs. See where your closest store is here. It\u2019s kinda hard to get motivated to run when your feet are sore. During a standard run, the foot is impacted by a force three to five times your body weight, so having a gel cushioning system like in the ASICS GEL-Kayano 21 (above) is ideal. It protects and stabilises the foot, meaning you won\u2019t regret your decision the moment your feet start pounding that pavement.  I\u2019m not kidding. Zombies, Run! is possibly the greatest thing to ever happen to your workout. What could be more motivating than literally (well, virually) running for your life from a flesh eating horde, collecting supplies and helping other survivors? If that sounds intense, it\u2019s because it is. But it might be just what you need to keep moving!

V var noskimwords = 'true'; Sponsored post\u000a\u000aSome people buy a vehicle and feel like it has plenty of power and a nice appearance at the time, but they later discover that they would like to make a few performance and cosmetic upgrades. Other people buy a car with the simple intention of turning it into a unique, high-powered vehicle.  The only problem is that people who decide to modify the cosmetic features or performance of their vehicle will find that these upgrades can be quite expensive. Auto supply stores charge a huge mark-up because they are essentially selling their products with the convenience factor of people being able to get what they need today, and the stores also have to pay several employees and a manager. If people want to save money, they should buy their performance car parts online through Prestige Performance Centre.  \u000aAbout Prestige Performance Centre Prestige Performance Centre is an online auto supply store that specializes in selling performance parts for nearly any vehicle. The nice thing about this store is that it will allow people to do all of their shopping from the comfort of their own home. In addition, this online store has the ability to stock far more parts and a wider selection than any other store since they are not limited on space like a typical retail location.  People will find that this site will allow them to save money on their parts, which is great news since it may allow people to buy multiple parts for the price of one elsewhere. People will find that this site is very organized, and it is extremely easy to find the parts that they are looking for. In addition, everyone knows that different cars have different measurements on parts, and Prestige Performance Center has worked to ensure that the customer will know that they are ordering a part that will fit their vehicle precisely.  This site stocks everything from power-boosting components to car stereos, so people will not have any reason to shop anywhere else. One issue that some people may have against shopping online is that they might get something different than they visualized, but if this is the case, Prestige Performance Centre will give customers a refund, credit or they will exchange the product within the first 28 days.  If people are looking to upgrade their car\u2019s performance or appearance, they should shop at Prestige Performance Centre. Prestige Performance Centre realizes that car fanatics want to receive their parts as soon as possible, and they also want to save money when upgrading their vehicle and this store will allow them to accomplish both tasks. With the massive inventory and low prices that Prestige Performance Centre has to offer, people really do not have a reason to shop elsewhere.\u000a  Always nice to read your blog.

VJust when you thought cars couldn\u2019t get much smarter, Mercedes-Benz has brought us the all new E-Class.  And it\u2019s packed with brilliant technology to make your ride as safe and comortable as possible. It boasts a 360-degree array of cameras, radars and other sensors. On board sensors check your blind spots, lane position and the distance to cars around you. If something sneaks into your blind spot, your car will register it, and alert you if you try and change lanes. It\u2019s also ready to intervene when necessary, automatically braking to avoid an accident, or assisting you to steer to avoid a dangerous situation or when the driver over-corrects.  But it\u2019s inside the car that the E-Class really shines. You can create an individual profile for each driver, to further enhance the comfort and driving experience. It can prompt you to take a necessary break, warning you if you\u2019re at risk of micro sleep \u2013 a helpful feature for Australia\u2019s vast open roads. In case an accident is unavoidable, the E-Class moves to another level. When a side-on collision is imminent, the car puts as much distance between the front passengers and the collision as possible \u2013 inflating the side of the seat closest to the impact. The car will also play a \u201cshort interference signal\u201d that prepares passengers\u2019 ears for the sound of the collision, reducing the hearing damage that can result from a collision. Comfort and safety take on a whole new dimension in this luxury car from the future.  Head over to Mercedes-Benz.com.au/eclass to find out more, or to configure your new E-Class.

VWe\u2019ve already told you about the benefits of working with Windows Azure and highlighted some of the great resources for building Azure apps. There\u2019s two other major options in the Azure pack to consider: AppFabric and Marketplace. Here\u2019s what you need to know. By definition, cloud services involve complex interaction between multiple components, and keeping track of just what\u2019s going on can sometimes be tricky. Azure\u2019s AppFabric middleware makes the process much more straightforward, adding a new level of services which your applications can draw on without having to deal with all the underlying complexities. This is referred to as a Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model, and just as with the main Azure platform, you only pay for what you actually use in delivering your applications. In practical terms, that means you can easily develop complex applications which make use of multiple services, letting you work easily with abstracted components rather than being distracted by integration details. New add-on layers for Visual Studio allow you to easily tie together separate components into a single app. AppFabric makes it easier to integrate existing applications into your cloud workflow, and to ensure that applications are delivered securely. The high-level middleware services which AppFabric provides are language-neutral, so you can make use of them whether you want to use .NET, Java, Ruby or PHP.  As you\u2019d expect from the name, the Windows Azure Marketplace is where developers can search for useful Azure resources and code, or sell their own creations. The Marketplace has two distinct components: Applications and DataMarket. Applications concentrates on coding resources, while DataMarket provides a central repository of public and commercial data services which can be used to feed into Windows Azure-based applications. Like any good development system, Windows Azure lets you build on the work of others. Windows Azure Marketplace Applications provides a central resource where developers can find building block components, plug-ins and administrative tools to incorporate into their own applications, as well as fully-completed applications and Azure training and services. It\u2019s a great resource for promoting your own products, as well as accessing specialist expertise if you\u2019re building a complex system. Getting listed on Marketplace Applications is a straightforward process \u2014 the system is driven by Microsoft\u2019s Pinpoint partner management system. Once you\u2019ve profiled your company and highlighted that you\u2019re working with Windows Azure, your application will be checked by Microsoft staff and then added to the Marketplace. Remember, if you\u2019ve got a great idea for a Windows Azure app, we can help make it happen \u2014 check out our awesome My Concept Rules contest.

V\u000aAustralia has its new luxury smartphone. The Xperia Z1, successor to the Xperia Z, is again waterproof/dust-resistant while its gorgeous 5-inch (1080p; 441ppi ) display thrashes the iPhone \u2014 aided by Sony\u2019s Triluminous and X-Reality Engines for superior images and video. Another must-see: The Z1\u2019s new 20.7MP camera paired with Sony\u2019s award-winning G-Lens, BIONZ image processing and a revamped camera interface. Take a look.  The Xperia Z1 is now available in black, white and purple in-store and through Sony online.\u000aTelstra, Optus and Virgin Mobile also offer the Z1 on various plans.  The Xperia Z1 is fast. You get a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB RAM, 4G support, and Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean). 16GB memory is built-in (expandable up to 64GB via micro SD card), and the 3,050mAh battery is rated for up to 15 hours talk time.  Yet the real innovations for the Xperia Z1 (and its 6.4-inch Xperia Z1 Ultra sibling) come as Sony integrates more of its proven world-class technologies than ever before. This includes drawing on the very best of Sony\u2019s camera expertise. It all adds up to sharper, clearer, brighter images. What you expect from a Sony compact digital camera, only this time in a slim waterproof smartphone with an aluminium and durable tempered glass unibody design.

V Nokia\u2019s latest offering stands out in the smartphone market for all the right reasons: Linux-based Maemo OS, PC-like performance and extensive customisation options. OK, so it\u2019s got pretty decent guts, but what about the rest? Pretty decent there too. It\u2019s got a sleek, compact design that\u2019s as practical as it is pretty, with a side-sliding, full QWERTY keyboard, removable battery and a sharp, transreflective LCD display that\u2019s easy to see in sunlight or no light. It also comes with a stylus, so if typing accurately with your thumbs is just not your thing, this 3.5-inch resistive touchscreen is made for you. Nokia also renews its focus on multimedia with two cameras on the Nokia N900. A VGA web camera on the front, and on the back, a 5MP Carl Zeiss camera with dual LED flash that also records DVD-quality, widescreen video. All your videos and photos can be contextualised with geotags, and, of course, you can upload them straight onto the web. You can find all the details, including the full spec list, at Nokia\u2019s website.

Internet safety is hugely important; there are a number of tips you can use to keep your child safe when he or she is online; here are five of the most important: The Internet can play an important role in your child\u2019s development, and in this respect it\u2019s great that most children above a certain age are knowledgeable when it comes to accessing websites and the capabilities of browsing. Internet safety is hugely important; there are a number of tips you can use to keep your child safe when he or she is online; here are five of the most important: \u000a1. Monitoring the use of the Internet\u000a  Cyberbullying is a major problem for children. You can help your kids combat this issue by monitoring their use of the Internet. Children should be limited to a certain amount of time online, and should only be able to access the Internet whilst in the same room as their parents. Another useful tip is to follow the guidelines set out by the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, known as \u2018Click Clever, Click Safe\u2019. This advice is designed to help parents and children understand the Internet and the risks that can be present when online. The code is broken down into three actions: zip, block and flag. Personal information should be kept private, and any unknown links received should not be opened. Cyberbullies should be blocked, and parents should encourage children to speak to them about any problems they have encountered online. \u000a2. Switch off Bluetooth and block websites\u000a  Mobile phones are an increasingly common medium through which people access the Internet, so mobile phone safety is an equally important issue. You can look after your children, even when they are not at home, by insisting that Bluetooth and location services are switched off. This will minimise the risk of people knowing where your children are at any particular time. It is also possible to block certain websites and keywords from being accessed; this will reduce the risk of your child accessing inappropriate content online. This can be done directly through your wireless router, which can be password-protected. \u000a3. Use social networking sites with care\u000a  Social networking sites should be used with care; only people who your children personally know should be befriended. Parents should also join the social networking sites their children are on, as this will enable them to keep a closer eye on who their children are speaking to online. \u000a4. Protect your child from spam\u000a    Spam is a form of email, which is sent randomly to users. These messages often contain links to pornographic material, as well as harmful websites. These can be a form of fraud, as credit card details are often asked for, and the account details are then used by the spammers. Children should be advised never to click on links that they are unsure of, and emails should only be opened if the recipient knows the sender. \u000a5. Online gaming\u000a  As any parent will tell you, most children love video games. Online is a section of the gaming market that is rapidly growing. Parents are often keen to encourage these games (especially those which have an educational twist), not least because many of them can be played for free. However, it is important to remember that online gaming does have a dark side. Games are not only hugely addictive; they also enable users to chat with other players. Children may not be aware of whom they are chatting to, and therefore the use of these games should be closely monitored. Finally, the best advice that can be given to parents surrounding Internet safety is to ensure that their children feel comfortable speaking about their experiences on the Internet. If this is the case, then they will be more likely to speak up should they encounter any problems.

V Featuring the new 1-Terabyte Panasonic BWT800 3D Blu-ray Disc Recorder.  The new Panasonic BWT800 certainly isn\u2019t what you\u2019d casually call a standard run of the mill Blu-ray recorder. The reason being that underneath its sleek outer shell lies an absolute plethora of electronic marvellousness. Such as: \u2013 Twin High Definition Tuner\u000a\u2013 VIErA Cast including Skype recording\u000a\u2013 Built in Wi-Fi\u000a\u2013 And DLNA as server and client And while these features are obviously right up there on the great to have list they still aren\u2019t the real reason the BWT800 \u2018s as good as it is. That honour\u2019s left to its monster 1-Terabyte hard drive. A hard drive so huge you can expect a full 28 days (or 684 hours) of high-def recording and playback (In HM mode only). That\u2019s a hell of a lot of World Cup rugby, a hell of a lot of movies, and way, way, way too many episodes of Friends.  That said, how do you demonstrate to all and sundry just how long 28 days actually is? Easy. You find a young (ish) man. In this case a bloke from Dee Why called Rommy Gulla. Convince him to allow his work and private life to be invaded. Convince him to let his mind be screwed with and life turned upside down by being pranked for 28 days straight. Then, of course, post it on the Internet on a daily basis for all the world to see. And the best bit is, you dear reader get to join in all the fun. Visit facebook.com/Panasonic or the Panasonic website, check out the New BWT800, then make a suggestion as to how you\u2019d make the next 28 days the longest most annoying 28 days of Rommy Gulla\u2019s life. Then if you\u2019re very, very lucky, your devious plan might just happen, and you might win some awesome prizes to boot.

V var noskimwords = 'true';  Sponsored post Aside from looking cool and futuristic in your living room, there are many advantages to owning an LCD TV. For a start, LCD flat screens are much easier to watch. They are significantly brighter and feature higher contrasts than your traditional television set.  Viewing in a brightly lit room won\u2019t wash out its picture and a lamplight won\u2019t cause a glare on your screen. The beauty of these flat screens is that you don\u2019t have to turn out the lights to see the image clearly and easily. Nor do you have to worry about eyestrain, since LCDs don\u2019t flicker the way old-fashioned TV sets do.  Recently there have been great technological advances in LCD TVs, with the new LED backlighting system. This enables better black levels and a brighter more energy efficient TV performance. Another advantage to LCD technology means that you can watch TV from almost anywhere in a room since flat-screen television displays can have up to a 160 degree viewing angle, which means your TV will look good when viewed from any point 80 degrees in either direction from the centre of the screen.  With an LCD screen, the picture is smooth, colourful, and (best of all) wide. They have none of those annoying scan lines that conventional sets do and they create smooth, evenly lit images across the entire surface of the display \u2013 plus 16.8 million different colours! If watching TV was your full-time job, and you did it 24 hours a day, it would take you almost 7 years to wear out your LCD display! Even with high usage of 8 hours per day, you can double the lifespan of your TV to 20 years. The LCD TV is also a computer monitor. In fact, it can accept any video format. They typically include USB and other inputs from a computer. Because of the high resolution of LCDs, text and graphics look especially sharp when viewed on them, which makes them the best solution for displaying data and web-based content too. So, kick back and enjoy the best in soaps, sports, drama and reality TV with a great value LG LCD TV.  I have recently bought a Panasonic LCD TV but have been pretty underwhelmed with the sound quality \u2013 can someone recommend a TV sound bar upgrade please?

V\u000a \u000a It wasn\u2019t that long ago that state of the art technology inside a car meant a built in CD player and central locking. Now the latest luxury vehicles boast more on board facilities than a top spec hi-tech home or super yacht! Take Chrysler\u2019s latest model, the 300C. We test drove this £40,000 machine around the Cambridgeshire countryside last week and were bowled over by its impressive spec. Not only does it boast a 3 litre V6 turbo diesel engine which ensures a smooth and powerful ride (as well as surprisingly good fuel efficiency up to 47.9 miles per gallon), it also features an 8.4 inch touch screen display that serves as the hub for many of the vehicle\u2019s advanced features.  Obviously it goes without saying there\u2019s a great sound system on board, complete with audio jack input for plugging in your iPod, or other MP3 device. But also fitted as standard is a 9 speaker sound system which can be upgraded to a 19 speaker Harman Kardon 7.1 surround sound set up complete with three subwoofers. Other entertainment features include an SD card reader for MP3 sound files, AM/FM radio tuner a CD/DVD player and an input for USB devices. Voice Control In car navigation is becoming increasingly important to help take the stress out of planning your journey and here the Chrysler 300C excels. On board is a Garmin based sat nav system complete which can be controlled safely either via the controls on the steering wheel or handsfree by voice alone so you can tell the car the name of the street you want to go to and it will do the rest. Uconnect Voice Command with Bluetooth control also lets you manage a Bluetooth compatible phone without having to take your hands off the steering wheel. The first time the phone is synchronised, the phonebook is downloaded to the car\u2019s hard drive and numbers can be selected simply by saying the person\u2019s name. When it comes to safety features, the Chrysler really does excel. While reversing into a parking space an image on the touch screen display shows the view from the back of the car provided by an board camera including a representation of the width of the car so you know instantly if the car parking space is big enough. Another safety feature is Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) which uses radar to automatically modify the Chrysler 300C\u2019s speed to keep a safe distance when the car approaches another vehicle in the same lane or even when a vehicle enters from another lane. Similarly Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) uses an ultra broadband radar sensor to search for cars that might be briefly concealed from your view. Icons illuminate in the mirror and an acoustic warning signal sounds if there is a car in the blind spot. For the ultimate in luxury the touch screen control can also be used to control your individual settings. Not only can the air conditioning be set to different temperatures for the driving and passenger seat, you can also precisely adjust the positioning of the seat, even set your seat to move out of the way of the steering wheel when the car is stationary to make it easier to get out of the car. Finally, the two front cup holders, cooled as heated and standard, come with LED lighting that glow blue when they\u2019re chilled and red when they\u2019re hot! What could be better than that! It seems driving really has entered the 21st century at last.  See video below for an explanation about everything that the Chrysler 300C\u2019s touch screen display can do:  See images of the new Chrysler 300C below:    \u000aChrysler 300C  \u000a Order a Test Drive now   Find out more  Sponsored Post \u000aViral video by ebuzzing   Other entertainment features include an SD card reader for MP3 sound files, AM/FM radio tuner a CD/DVD player and an input for USB devices.

VHalloween, All Hallow\u2019s Eve, Ash vs Evil Dead Day. You can catch this much anticipated reboot from October 31 anytime, anywhere, on Stan. Keep reading to find out why you should be adding Ash vs Evil Dead to your spooky celebrations.  Bruce Campbell is Ash Williams and he\u2019s back to reprise the role. Hail to the king baby. Army of Darkness was released in 1992 and aside from the Ash-less 2013 reboot, there has been no addition to the Evil Dead canon since. It\u2019s been a long wait for loyal fans and judging from what we\u2019ve seen so far it\u2019s been worth it. The Evil Dead franchise is Raimi\u2019s creation and the fact he\u2019s back to produce and direct the first episode gives Ash Vs Evil Dead real credibility.  Expect blood, gore and carnage, Campbell has said \u201cit would be silly of us to rip the fans off by doing a watered-down version of the series\u201d. We look forward to the resulting mayhem.  Image via Shutterstock\u000aIf there is a better way to spend 45 minutes on October 31st we\u2019d like to hear it.\u000aAsh Vs Evil Dead IS Halloween. Xena: Warrior Princess. That is all.   Here\u2019s something to whet your appetite! Stan is bringing it to you at the same time as the US so you literally can\u2019t get it any quicker.

VGoodyear is celebrating 100 years as an industry leader in tyre technology, innovation and safety on Australia\u2019s roads.  From the humble beginnings of a small office at 231 Clarence Street, Sydney in 1915, it wasn\u2019t long before Goodyear established a presence nation-wide, with distribution arrangements through local motor suppliers in Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane to meet customer demand. Within 10 years, Goodyear tyres were so enthusiastically accepted by the Australian public, that in July 1925, Mr. W.G Kither, former manager of the Goodyear Adelaide branch, floated the idea of opening a local manufacturing plant. Two years later, in 1927, Goodyear produced its first Australian-made tyre from a manufacturing plant in Granville, Sydney.  Testament to its innovation, quality and customer-focused products, Goodyear grew its operations considerably by 1930, with additional depots being established in Newcastle, Goulburn, Tamworth and Lismore in New South Wales, while other states were served by depots at Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong in Victoria; and Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns in Queensland. Demand continued, as did supply, and by 1932 Goodyear had manufactured one million tyres in Australia. By 1951 Goodyear had increased this volume to 10 million tyres.  During World War II, Goodyear\u2019s Australian operations contributed to servicing the tyre needs of aircraft, service trucks, jeeps, motorcycles and service equipment. Additionally, the manufacture of bullet-seal fuel tanks and aircraft tyres \u2013 both vital items for war \u2013 were pioneered in Australia by Goodyear.  At the turn of the century, the company launched the iconic Goodyear blimp into Australian skies in support of the 2000 Olympic Games. The blimp provided aerial network television coverage for various events throughout the country. Today, Goodyear remains an industry leader in tyre innovation, which it transfers across the globe to markets in which it operates.  Some of the innovations brought to Australia in recent years have included the launch of the revolutionary RunOnFlat Technology in 2005, allowing motorists to continue driving even after a puncture; the introduction of Fuel Saving Technology in the Assurance Fuel Max tyre in 2010, designed to save customers money at the pump; and the use of Goodyear\u2019s QuietTred Technology, which contributes to the EfficientGrip Performance tyre being Goodyear\u2019s quietest ever luxury tyre. While innovation is inherent and pivotal to Goodyear\u2019s local success, the brand\u2019s nationwide family of company-owned, franchised and independent tyre dealers who have stocked and distributed products over the century has been fundamental too. From its first retail branch in Melbourne (1915), there are now hundreds of dealers flying the Goodyear flag across Australia. Commenting on the company\u2019s evolution and commitment to the Australian market, Goodyear\u2019s managing director in Australia, Thierry Villard, said: \u201cA centenary is a remarkable achievement and testament to the strength of our business, team and customers.  \u201cAs industries and companies have come and gone over the decades, Goodyear Australia has achieved and sustained a reputation as an industry leader through continued innovation, adaptation to changing markets, as well as a continued commitment to understanding and delivering on what our customers value and need.  \u201cInnovation and safety have been, and will always remain, at the core of the Goodyear brand. We take great pride in continuing to be one of the country\u2019s \u2014 and the world\u2019s \u2014 top tyre companies, leading the way with our technology. \u201cI thank the thousands of dealers and distributors, the hundreds of thousands of users of our products and of course each and every one of our Australian team for their support over the last century. I look forward to the continuation of Goodyear in Australia for the next 100 years, with the best yet to come!\u201d

Using web-native technologies like Canvas and HTML5 Video/Audio elements, the seamless experience blurs the lines between what\u2019s pre-recorded and what\u2019s being generated live. ForestFly was created as an experiment to explore the boundaries of HTML5. With limited knowledge of Canvas, the team behind it finished the project in less than 5 days thanks to broad community knowledge and relative ease of use. You can read about the lessons they learned over at Australian developer hub, LaLaNinja.com.au.   When you try ForestFly for yourself, you should know that all the major browsers support HTML5 video and audio, but there has not been a unanimous decision made over the default supported codecs. And this is a graphics-intensive app.  So we encourage you to test in all your browsers to see how each performs. Our best results are in IE9. Canvas is a brilliant tool with ever-increasing browser support. It allows you to easily compile static images or full blown animations without the need to install additional plugins. Though HTML5 is still relatively new, there are fantastic developer hubs all over the web, including at La La Ninja, to provide paths to the assistance you may need.

VSponsored article By KfirGodrich Thurstein Velben said that \u201cinvention is the mother of necessity\u201d \u2013 certainly this is something that is describing very well the IT drivers of the current year.  If you agree that your business is just as good as the IT running it, then you can certainly understand the shift we took from focusing on efficiency towards productivity. This trend is not only imposing a culture of innovation for the enterprise, rather than better utilization, but also creates a mechanism of pressure from the management level downstream. This method is based on output measurement. Therefore, the increased requirements for business intelligence are taking a stake of about one third out of all IT technologies segments across all industries nowadays. To support the directions mentioned earlier, the IT industry is changing accordingly; from being supported out of pairs of high availability data centers towards multiple distributed data centers with lower availability (Cloud Computing models might include also combination of the mentioned schemes).  The owned or outsourced models are based on minimized CAPEX and OPEX followed by variable services cost models. The former efficiency process turns into an optimized \u201ctransfer function\u201d such as ROI (Return of Investment) or equivalent. The physical enabler of that approach is the \u201cIndustrialized IT\u201d \u2013 the ability to put IT into the business in a fast, affordable, modular and scalable fashion. But behind the inventions, the strategies, the technologies and the implementations stand people that devote their time and skills to take the clients business forward, supporting the decision makers with the methodology and tools leading to the right decision.  The new HP \u201cHumanity\u201d campaign, which I\u2019m proud to be part of, is providing a closer look into the ways in which we are trying to help our customers with innovative Technology Services. Hope you\u2019ll take some time to visit and \u201cconnect\u201d with me and my colleagues at www.hp.com/go/tsconnect. So although Einstein said that \u201cit is appallingly obvious that our technology exceeds our humanity\u201d, maybe we can do something to compensate there.

V<br />\u000avar noskim = true;<br />\u000avar noskimwords = true;<br />\u000avar noskimlinks = true;<br />\u000a Sponsored post It is impossible for companies to continue to remain stuck in their old way of doing things, when it comes to Human Resources and personnel management. The world is a very fast paced place and with the ever increasing need for all things to be done at speed, HR has had to move with the times.  Some companies are being left behind, some are flying ahead on the wings ever-developing technology and others are beginning to understand that a diverse modern workforce can do an awful lot for themselves in terms of keeping their personal details up to date.  The term for such HR software is self-service HR. Employees are provided with access to enable them to update their personal details or request leave for instance. This enables HR employees to spend time on more on effective HR requirements and gives other employees more control of their personal details data.  The overall benefits of a self-service HR function reduces the number of errors that can occur in terms of change of address for example and more importantly reduces dramatically the amount of paper work that can at times swamp HR departments. Self-service HR software also provides an effective method for management to access employee\u2019s individual data and to monitor such things as holiday leave, sickness absence and can be an effective tool to conduct appraisal or performance reviews.  Self-service HR software does not in any way reduce the amount of control management has over the overall HR records \u2013 employees will only be provided access to relevant data input areas of the HR record, management can securely extract report data that may be required and can also input secure data themselves, restricting some data entry from employee access.  The restriction of access operates through a system of access privilege levels. For example a member of staff could place a request for holiday leave at one level of the system and authorisation for the leave would occur at management level, accessed via management privilege. Very efficient, very secure and extremely effective in terms of employee time! How does a self-service HR system operate when such things as a holiday request requires approval \u2013 quite simply the system utilises an e-mail alert system. The holiday request generates an e-mail alert to line management \u2013 once authorised the employee receives an e-mail alert to indicate authorisation.  It is so efficient that the older ways of authorising holiday leave cannot be comprehended. The holiday record sheet, filling out the dates, sending the paperwork to HR, waiting for the form to be returned on and on and on. Fast and efficient self-service HR software is now the way of the world for leading edge businesses. For forward looking companies it is a progressive process and for organisations with paper based HR functions it has got to be something they must consider. HR self-service software is the way forward. It\u2019s not just a method of company progression, it is a way to empower a diverse workforce.

VThe longest running action film franchise ever, we\u2019ve been thrilled by the antics of Agent 007 for 53 years. Now you can catch Mr Bond, James Bond anytime, anywhere on Stan.   Everyone has their own top 10 Bond films. Here Stan\u2019s resident Bond expert\u2019s picks \u2014 what are yours? James Bond goes rogue and sets off to unleash vengeance on a drug lord who tortured his best friend, a C.I.A. agent, and left him for dead and murdered his bride after he helped capture him.  In this film Timothy Dalton reprises his role as 007, and a 21 year old Benicio Del Toro as the youngest Bond villain ever. Agent 007 (Sean Connery) and the Japanese secret service ninja force must find and stop the true culprit of a series of spacejackings before nuclear war is provoked. Screenplay writer Roald Dahl later said that of all the filmed adaptations of his written works, this one was the only one where he liked the filmed results. Agent 007 (Roger Moore) is assigned to hunt for a lost British encryption device and prevent it from falling into enemy hands.  Fans and critics complained that the series had become too focused on wild gadgets, outlandish plots, over-the-top villains and screwball comedy. As a result, producers decided to return to a more realistic storyline with this film.   James Bond (Sean Connery) heads to The Bahamas to recover two nuclear warheads stolen by SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo in an international extortion scheme. The budget for this Bond film was more than the combined budgets of the first three Bond films, and is the 27th biggest grossing film of all time. James Bond willingly falls into an assassination ploy involving a naive Russian beauty in order to retrieve a Soviet encryption device that was stolen by SPECTRE. Sean Connery said that this movie was his personal favorite out of the Bond films he did, and it was also the last ever viewed by 007 creator Ian Fleming.  Bond\u2019s loyalty to M is tested when her past comes back to haunt her. Whilst MI6 comes under attack, 007 (Daniel Craig) must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost. Judi Dench has more screen time in this film alone than Desmond Llewelyn had in his 17 films as Q, making her portrayal of M the most common character in the series after Bond himself. James Bond investigates the hijacking of British and Russian submarines carrying nuclear warheads with the help of a KGB agent whose lover he killed.  After the film\u2019s release, demand for white Lotus Esprit cars surged to the point that new customers had to be placed on a three-year waiting list.  James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) teams up with the lone survivor of a destroyed Russian research center to stop the hijacking of a nuclear space weapon by a fellow agent believed to be dead.  This film features the highest bungee jump from a structure in a movie, with a drop of over 722 ft.  Armed with a licence to kill, Secret Agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) sets out on his first mission as 007 and must defeat a weapons dealer in a high stakes game of poker at Casino Royale, but things are not what they seem. Watch that opening parkour chase carefully \u2014 it took 6 weeks to film. Investigating a gold magnate\u2019s smuggling, James Bond (Sean Connery) uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve. Goldfinger features the first appearance of a laser beam in a movie. In the original script, the scene had a spinning buzzsaw (as in the novel) until it was decided that such an image had become \u201ccommonplace and unoriginal\u201d. Are we missing one of your top 10? Is there one on this list you\u2019d drop? Tell us in the comments below.\u000a Soooo Much Connery. I also find it weird as Octopussy is generally considered as the best bond film and it's now argued that skyfall has surpassed that. One marked low and the other is unseen!

VYour smartphone camera should do more than just take photos. You want it to record every aspect of your life, and sometimes that calls for more than just a quick snapshot. The HTC One and new HTC One mini camera can turn live action into an impressive action montage photo, and can record slow-motion videos that bring out amazing detail.  Sequence Shot mode lets you capture a dynamic montage of fast-moving action on a static background, and turn it into a single photo that you can easily share with your friends, family and the world. Sequence Shot works thanks to the continuous shooting photo mode, which can capture 8 full-size and full-quality photos per second. All you\u2019ve got to do is hold down the shutter button on the HTC One and HTC One mini\u2019s touchscreen with continuous shooting enabled, and the camera app does the rest.  Once you\u2019ve captured your action photos, go into the gallery and open that batch of photos \u2014 they\u2019re all saved at once, so you can easily look through them. You\u2019ll be able to choose the Sequence Shot option, and stitch together up to five photos at once to make a single, stop-motion photo that looks great.  Recording video on your smartphone is a great way of making a memory of scenes or places that are too complex for just one or two photos. Videos don\u2019t always let you pay attention to the fine detail, though \u2014 there\u2019s a lot going on at once. HTC has a smart solution for that: variable speed video. All you have to do is record a video with the slow-motion video mode enabled in the camera app\u2019s settings menu. Video recording works just as you\u2019d expect \u2014 tap the button to start recording a video, and tap it again to stop. That video file is saved to your gallery just like any other photo or video, but the slow-motion mode means you can edit it to add dramatic impact by choosing a segment to slow playback by up to four times. If you\u2019ve got a video with some fast action, choose that section of video, slow it down, and watch the results \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to see all that fast action more clearly, and get the effect that professional movie makers pay thousands for.  \u000aLearn more about Sequence Shot and Object Removal on the HTC One or HTC One mini at\u000aHTC Australia\u2019s website.

VFollowing our guide to starting and growing your business, we\u2019ve teamed up with Bankwest, Smart Investor\u2019s Business Bank of the Year, to explore some further tips, tools and ideas to help keep your business in great shape once it\u2019s up and running.  Cash flow is the pulse of your business, so of course you\u2019ll be monitoring it closely and actively looking for ways to improve it.  \u2022 This cash flow forecaster will help identify running costs and how much money you\u2019ll need to stay in business all year. Factor in seasonality, look for weaknesses in cash flow and pay invoices on time. \u2022 Boost your cash flow by reviewing your business\u2019 key cash flow measures like your marginal cash flow (i.e. cash flow from each additional dollar of sales) and cash flow cycle (i.e. time to receive cash from sales). To calculate these for your business and determine what you can do to improve these, try Bankwest\u2019s cash flow improvement calculator. Build yourself a business dashboard. Strategic operation requires quick and up-to-date access to vital business stats like sales, profits, cash flow and more. You may be able to get by with the built-in tools in your CRM or ERP platform or even an Excel spreadsheet. You could also tailor a dashboard to your specific needs using advanced tools like NetSuite.  \u2022 Make sure you know your break even point. This handy break even calculator will help you determine the level of business activity required to achieve your desired financial return.  Good record keeping is important in every business \u2014 as is knowing the tax you need to pay for your employees and understanding what deductions or concessions you may be able to claim.  \u2022 Step 1: Register your business and set up good accounting habits. Bankwest provides free daily bank feeds for customers with eligible accounts, so it\u2019s easy to automatically reconcile business transactions with online accounting services like Xero and MYOB. \u2022 Step 2:  Consult a tax professional, who can help you determine what hard copy and electronic business records you\u2019ll need to keep on file and for how long (generally five years).  \u2022 Step 3: Be sure to ask your accountant \u2013 and the ATO \u2014 about potential tax deductions (for related expenses incurred running your business) and tax concessions. Eligibility for concessions could apply to your income tax, capital gains tax, GST and fringe benefits. Visit \u2018How To Keep On Top Of Tax\u2018 at Bankwest for more helpful info.  Put a risk management plan in place and you\u2019ll spend less time worrying about your business and more time building it. Make sure you have adequate insurance for the tools and equipment you need to stay up and running. Have a business continuity plan. Diversify and widen your customer base. Monitor your reputation. Bankwest has a detailed run-through of each of these points.  \u2022 And here\u2019s a great red tape checklist for legislation, regulations, standards and codes of practice for businesses.  Marketing your business can be quite creatively rewarding. You might use physical signs and banners to email newsletters or Facebook \u2014 and everything in between.  Invest time to really get to know and understand your customers and how you can give them more of what they want. Supporting your community and fostering word of mouth should never be underrated, but neither should direct marketing methods like emails and texts (subject to meeting all privacy obligations) \u2014 especially if you\u2019re providing exclusive offers. Consider loyalty programs. And never forget the up-sell.  \u2022 How will you get your business noticed?\u000aThis marketing plan template and tips will help you brainstorm some ideas. Bankwest provides personal and business banking solutions for more than 1.3 million retail and business customers across Australia. Bankwest customers enjoy access to an extensive network of stores and business centres, direct and third party distribution channels, agencies and electronic banking facilities, as well as 24-hour telephone and internet banking.

V Featuring the new Panasonic BWT800 3D Blu-ray Disc Recorder  OK, here\u2019s the story. Three or so weeks ago the clever people at Panasonic released their new BWT 800 3D Blu-ray Disc Recorder with enormous 1 Terabyte hard drive. A hard drive so huge you can expect a full 28 days (or 684 hours) of high def recording and playback (In HM mode only). So to demonstrate just how long 28 days really can be, they\u2019ve been making 28 days of a bloke called Rommy Gulla\u2019s life, the longest and most annoying he\u2019ll ever experience.  Sound like fun? Well if your names not Rommy Gulla then absolutely it does! Because over the past weeks poor Rommy\u2019s had an absolute nightmare of a time. He\u2019s been assaulted by gun toting SWAT members, cockroaches and yoga balls. He\u2019s been tarred and feathered, electrocuted and publicly humiliated. He\u2019s been frightened half to death by snakes, had his beloved car all but destroyed, and, on more than one occasion, had some fairly unfortunate bathroom experiences.  So what\u2019s next for Rommy? Well it\u2019s not over yet that\u2019s for sure, there\u2019s still plenty of pranks to be pulled and prizes to be won including a Panasonic Home Theatre Package, Panasonic Full HD Tough Mobile Cameras, Panasonic Noise Cancelling Headphones, Panasonic Micro High Fi Systems, and of course, the amazing new BWT 800 Blu Ray Disc Recorders!!. So don\u2019t miss out, visit facebook.com/Panasonic or the Panasonic website, check out the New BWT800, and all its other fancy features (plus the last three weeks persecutions if you\u2019ve missed them) then maybe click on Support Rommy and give him a hug.

V// <![CDATA[\u000avar noskimwords = 'true';\u000a// ]]&gt;\u000a// <![CDATA[\u000avar noskimwlinks = 'true';\u000a// ]]&gt; Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario Maker has been described as the perfect tool to learn the basics of game design Over the last decade, gaming has really evolved. At one time almost all gaming took place offline, but now gamers spend most of their gaming time online, interacting with fellow players across the world in real time, and regularly competing in multinational tournaments. In many quarters, gaming is considered to be an \u2018e-sport\u2019 and the very best gamers play at a professional level, including online gamblers for whom the high cash prizes are a great draw. In fact, the industry has developed to such an extent that the most talented gamers are taking it one step further and creating their very own unique games using platforms designed exactly for this purpose. For example, Microsoft has recent stated that it will enable everyone to use the Xbox to develop, as well as to play games. By simply downloading an app, gamers will be able to transform the Xbox, and other consoles like it, into fun, free game creation tools. In doing so, they\u2019ll open up exciting new avenues of gaming potential. How about building a game based on your favourite sport, TV show or movie and inviting friends from across the globe to give it a whirl? Or, what about creating the game you and your real-world friends have always wished existed? For hobbyists who love their games, this is exciting news. It could also be the starting point for the great game designers of the future, equipping them with the building blocks to start exploring their creative potential from the comfort of their own homes. Not to be outdone by Microsoft, Nintendo has released its own platform for games creation \u2013 Super Mario Maker. This game creation system allows players to create and play their own custom-designed levels of Super Mario Bros. classic games. It was released late in 2015. The platform has been called \u2018a perfect tool to learn the basics of game design\u2019 because of the way in which it guides users progressively through the levels of game creation. People of all ages can let their imaginations run free, building enemies, monsters, rewards and tasks, which ultimately come together to form levels other users can try out. Over the past few years a number of \u2018indie\u2019 games have stormed the charts, proving that it\u2019s not just the \u2018big boys\u2019 who can create big-sellers and, when they\u2019re afforded the tools to do so, clever independent gamers can create masterpieces. Of course, the platforms discussed above guide their users through only the most rudimentary aspects of a game\u2019s design and build. Some types of games may prove far too challenging for the amateur game designer to build. Take, for example, online casinos, where most of the action undoubtedly takes place on the slot machines. The slot machine is one of the most complex games within an online casino and its design is often amended. As well as a games designer, mathematicians, testers, developers and other professionals are often involved in the build, adding extra layers of challenge to the task. While it may be relatively easy to start out building your own Mario Bros. level, some types of game design are best left to the experts. However, while platforms exist for talented youngsters to flex their creative and technological muscles, we can we sure that there\u2019ll always be people out there who are able to take our gaming experiences to the next level of pleasure.     Chris has been a journalist for more years than he cares to remember, going freelance in 1997 on the same weekend Princess Diana died (he doesn\u2019t think the two events are related). When he\u2019s not writing about the latest developments in the connected home, he\u2019s normally driving his little smart car round town. A passionate swimmer, Chris has his own swimming blog and is a qualified lifeguard.

V Sponsored post Many small and medium sized businesses find themselves in a tricky situation today. They need to expand their IT and communications offerings, but don\u2019t have the technical staff or the expertise to achieve this.

It\u2019s not your average 1080p home theatre projector: WirelessHD eliminates cable clutter in your office or living room, and for 3D, 480Hz active shutter tech delivers a brighter image. The TW9000W also converts 2D images into 3D \u2013 made more immersive with 2400 lumens brightness and a dynamic 200,000:1 contrast ratio.  Now you have true choice in where you install your projector. Wirelessly beam HDMI-quality signals from Blu-ray players, game consoles or set top boxes without compression or deterioration, giving high quality images every time.  The TW9000W includes a compact WirelessHD transmitter (pictured) right in the box. Two 3D glasses are also included.  Epson\u2019s new 3LCD optical engine provides vibrant, bright colours in both 2D and 3D modes, in addition to a dynamic contrast ratio of 200,000:1 for incredible blacks \u2014 in a range of ambient lighting conditions. And the TW9000W can also project a 1080p image up to 7.6m in size. But how\u2019s it handle 3D? A major hurdle in all 3D systems is maintaining image brightness and thus picture quality. The TW9000W addresses this by using a 480Hz Active Shutter system rather than the slower 240Hz system. This minimises the blackout time (cross talk) of 3D glasses. The less time the lenses are closed, the more light can come through resulting in a brighter image. As you\u2019d expect on a projector of this calibre, the TW9000W conforms to THX Certification and ISF Calibration, ensuring you\u2019ll achieve accurate and exceptional image quality. You also get a handy split-screen viewing capability that lets you project two images side-by-side. Finally, the TW9000W has anamorphic capabilities in both 2D and 3D. When content is played back on a 16:9 screen, the viewer sees black bars above and below the image. Anamorphic Widescreen (vertical stretch) mode fills the 16:9 imaging area, pushing black bars out of the viewing area. When used with an anamorphic lens assembly in this mode, the full, original theatrical aspect ratio is restored (i.e. the entire screen is filled with the image). And, all imaging pixels are used, resulting in a brighter picture. Enjoy the ultimate 3D cinematic experience at home.\u000aVisit epson.com.au/tw9000w for more details.

V Video: The Huawei Watch is the most sophisticated Android-powered wearable we\u2019ve ever seen, and for good reason: it\u2019s very well put together.  Now that I've seen the Fossil Q Founder I think I prefer it's look, but the Huawei Watch seems like a better device. If the Huawei Watch had an ambient light sensor I'd probably buy one. As it stands I'm very tempted but I think ambient brightness adjustment is a key in making the device blend in and feel like a traditional watch, something that you don't even notice while it's busy making your life easier. It makes the iwatch look pretty blando. This watch has no ambient light sensor and the brightness has to be adjusted manually but I'm amazed at the ridicule heaped on the Moto 360 2015 for the 'flat tyre' look nescessary for an ambient light sensor which is out of proportion and did not assess the trade-offs.

VAs Lifehacker covered in \u2018The Next Five Years Of IT\u2018, the modern data centre is no longer a static environment. To stay competitive, you need an agile data centre which can deploy on-premises, pure cloud or hybrid technologies as the need arises. But what\u2019s the best way to effectively manage and deploy those resources? Here\u2019s how to control your data across all major platforms and protect against security breaches, loss of data and business downtime.  A high performance and reliable agile data centre environment is all about balance. It\u2019s about getting the appropriate resources delivered to the right users, applications, places, locations and platforms in the right way \u2014 when you need them. Check out the short video below where Jeff Hausman from Symantec elaborates on this concept.   Forrester Research defines business agility as \u201cthe quality that allows an enterprise to embrace market and operational changes as a matter of routine\u201d. It\u2019s not a new concept for business, but it\u2019s a modern, competitive opportunity for IT. A business is only as agile as its data centre, after all. Symantec\u2019s unique platform-agnostic tools are specifically designed to enable this transformation, with solutions to manage security, data protection, storage, business continuity, and compliance more efficiently, and with less risk.  >NetBackup: Manages backups across heterogeneous environments and helps ensure service levels are met with elastic, scalable data protection. >Storage Foundation: Keeps mission-critical data, applications, and infrastructure highly-available and agile to satisfy changing business requirements. >Disaster Recovery Advisor: Complements high availability and disaster recovery solutions to help ensure your business continuity plan will work when needed. >Data Centre Security: Server & Server Advanced: help secure physical and virtual servers and help evolve your data centre\u2019s security architecture. \u000awww.symantec.com.au/transform  #GoTransform.\u000a   Young IT worker image courtesy Shutterstock

From catch-up TV apps and streaming Foxtel movies to TV show suggestions tailored to your viewing habits. With voice interaction, you can ask your 2013 Samsung Smart TV questions like \u201canything to watch?\u201d and have S-Recommendation display your list. And your Samsung Smart TV isn\u2019t just listening. Face recognition* helps it know you\u2019re you.   Samsung has also simplified fundamentals like channel surfing. On-screen, the \u2018On TV\u2019 interface presents a live feed of the channel you\u2019re on, alongside a grid of what\u2019s live on other channels. Over time, S-Recommendation begins to learn and overlay the kind of programs you like best. You can even use Motion Control to give a \u201cthumbs up\u201d gesture to a show* and S-Recommendation will remember it to suggest more of the same.  As you move about, you can use voice interaction by speaking into the microphone on the sleek Smart Touch remote. It also features a touch screen for more precise control of the upgraded Smart Hub 2.0 interface. This is where you can also access your own photos, videos and music plus switch between/download an impressive range of Smart TV apps.   The Apps Panel is the section of the Smart Hub where you can expand your TV\u2019s capabilities by choosing from a huge and growing range of apps that add extra content and features to your entertainment experience. You may be interested in movies on-demand from Quickflix or BigPond, catch-up TV via the Yahoo 7 PLUS7 app; apps for fitness, music streaming with Samsung Music Hub, the list goes on.  And you can control it all with your Smart TV\u2019s Voice and Motion control features (on select models).  *Requires built-in camera accessory, sold separately.

V Featuring the new Panasonic BWT800 3D Blu-Ray Recorder (and ever so slightly annoyed Rommy)  In case you haven\u2019t heard, the incredibly clever people at Panasonic have brought out a fancy new 3D Blu-ray Disc Recorder with massive 1 Terabyte hard drive. A hard drive so huge it can store a gargantuan 28 days (or 684 hours) of high-def recording and playback (In HM mode only). And to demonstrate just how long 28 days really can be, they\u2019re making the next 28 days of a young bloke called Rommy Gulla\u2019s life, the longest, most annoying 28 days he\u2019ll ever experience. That said, it\u2019s now week two and we\u2019re delighted to announce that Rommy\u2019s survived pretty much intact. He\u2019s been rudely awoken by a hyped up gun welding SWAT team, blasted with a storm of yellow dust in his car, and electrocuted mercilessly!  All this and he\u2019s only a quarter the way through, poor bugger. So what\u2019s in store for Rommy in the week to come? Well maybe you can help answer that.  Visit facebook.com/Panasonic or the Panasonic website, check out the New BWT800, then make a suggestion as to how you\u2019d make the next 28 days the longest most annoying 28 days of Rommy Gulla\u2019s life. If your dastardly devious idea is good enough, it\u2019ll not only be endured in real life by poor young Rommy, but you might even stand a chance of winning some super duper top notch Panasonic prizes.

V\u000aAllure Media\u2019s IT manager Ben White is an alpha geek, a technology guru and the first person to install every beta going around. How is the Microsoft Virtual Academy site helping him master Windows Server 2012?\u000a Our in-house servers at Allure Media run Windows Server 2008, so I\u2019ve been following developments with Windows Server 2012 pretty closely. As soon as the final trial version was available for testing, I downloaded a copy and installed it as a VM so I could get a feel for how it worked. The install process went very smoothly, and the new Windows 8 interface makes it easy to get around. But I quickly realised that learning Windows Server 2012 in-depth and working out how it could improve our business systems would require more than just some casual clicking about, especially after I got exposed to some of the more advanced features of the platform at TechEd Australia 2012. That\u2019s where the Windows Server 2012: Technical Overview course on Microsoft Virtual Academy comes in. I\u2019ve been able to work through the modules I\u2019m interested in and test my knowledge when I\u2019m done. Having video content is more effective for me than just reading through a bunch of files, though there is plenty of detail if I want to check something more specific. The ones that immediately interest me are the server virtualisation and automation tracks, but it\u2019s good to know I can pick up on other aspects when I need them. Lifehacker, Gizmodo and Kotaku keep me pretty busy (not to mention my life outside of work), so committing to a formal course of study would be pretty much impossible. With the Virtual Academy materials, I can take time out for education when it suits, whether I\u2019m at work or on the train home. The self-assessment module means I can check whether I\u2019ve absorbed everything, but there\u2019s no pressure and I can learn at my own pace. That said, the fact that there\u2019s a leaderboard does appeal to my inner gamer! Maybe I\u2019ll tackle that identity management module . . .

VAh, mobile phones. We\u2019ve lost a few. But thanks to the new Windows® phone operating system, that might not be as big a pain as it once was. Using the My Phone service- available on Windows® phone 6.5 operated phones- you can use your PC to send a personalised message to your phone\u2019s homescreen with instructions on how to get the phone back if you lose it. Sure, there\u2019s a small fee but just think of the many new handsets you\u2019ll be saved from having to fork out for. The My Phone service automatically backs up contacts, calendars, photos, music, and text messages to a password-protected web account that you can access from any internet-connection. Which means all your important information won\u2019t be stuck on your phone.  Just plug your phone into your computer, and your content will be synchronised so it can be managed on either your PC or handset. With Windows® phone (and Windows on your PC, of course), it\u2019s easier to keep things in sync.

VA house is a massive investment, both financially and emotionally. It\u2019s something you live with, passing it on or using it to fund your retirement. If you\u2019re paying more than you should for your home loan, it\u2019s going to hurt more than your monthly paycheck. This is something that will reverberate throughout life. See how much you can save with a quick text message via Shutterstock You should check on your home loan regularly, to make sure you are getting the best deal. Even a slight difference in what you pay can have a huge difference over the life of a loan. Pay attention to the interest rate, fees, and the term and type of the loan. All of these will impact your monthly payments, and, in turn, how much you pay for your home. Consider restructuring your loan or switching providers. Doing so can enable you to repay a smaller amount on your home, faster. Which means more money for renovations and other goodies. There are plenty of tools online that you can use to investigate your options. Bankwest has plenty of calculators to calculate what your minimum loan repayments could be, based on the home loan amount, interest rate, payment frequency, and much more. There are also comparison pages, to check out all the different types of loans available with Bankwest, and how they could impact your bottom line. There are many different options when it comes to home loans.  One of the most common types of housing packages are variable rate home loans. The interest rate on these loans fluctuate with the interest rates in the economy. This means you pay less when interest rates are low, although the opposite also applies.  A fixed rate home loan allows you to lock in your interest rate, typically for 1 to 5 years. This could save you when interest rates start to rise, allowing to keep paying the same interest rate as when you took out the loan, and allows you to plan ahead. When you\u2019re coming to the end of your fixed rate period it is a good time to look around for new options \u2014 you may get a better deal elsewhere.  If both of these options are appealing, you can get the best of both worlds by splitting your loan \u2014 repaying part of your home loan with a fixed interest rate, and the rest with a variable rate. This is called a split loan, and is offered by providers like Bankwest. Some banks also have offset accounts \u2014 bank accounts that, when linked to your home loan, will allow you to reduce the interest charged on your loan. If you have $200,000 owing on your home loan, for example, and $20,000 in your offset account with 100% offset, you will only pay interest on $180,000 of your home loan. Newer home loans may also have different features than what\u2019s baked in your old contract. Some of Bankwest\u2019s variable home loans, for example, include free online redraw so you can access extra funds online or through your app.  It doesn\u2019t take much to find out if you can save by switching home loan providers. Bankwest has a service to text your postcode, or call 13 59 15 to find out if you can save on your home loan by switching to Bankwest. Their home loan experts will complete a home loan review to help you see if you can save.  Lending criteria, fees and charges apply., Terms and Cconditions apply and are available on request.

VThere are some impressive advances within the sleek lines of Samsung\u2019s new TV line up, including the 65-inch Series 8 LED. A quad-core processor helps stream content faster and works alongside Micro Dimming tech to produce more detailed pictures. World-class motion clarity brings sport to life and Samsung\u2019s unique Evolution Kit future-proofs your investment by letting you effectively upgrade your TV. Let\u2019s take a look. It begins with smart design. Samsung\u2019s 2013 TV collection is constructed from premium metals perched upon designer alloy stands. The goal: A picture that almost seems to float in the air. All the while image quality remains front-of-mind; starting with a new Ultra Clear panel structure that absorbs external light to minimise reflections and maximise clarity.  Next-generation image quality algorithms powered by quad-core (F8000 Series) or dual-core (F6400-F7100 Series) processors continually adjust and refine image settings with Samsung\u2019s Micro Dimming tech to produce vivid images and deep contrast; enhancing shadows and highlights for a more accurate picture. Micro Dimming is available on Samsung\u2019s F8000, F7100, F6800, F6700 and F6400 Series LED TVs. Micro Dimming works constantly and is able to respond almost instantly to the changing brightness levels in a moving image on the screen, applying the necessary adjustments across multiple areas of the screen at once \u2013 up to 576 zones with Micro Dimming Ultimate on the F8000 Series \u2013 to help maximise the contrast in every image and reveal the detail you were meant to see. Learn more.  The F8000 Series\u2019 quad-core processor also powers Samsung\u2019s Clear Motion Rate technology to help minimise blur in fast-moving images like those in sports, action-movies and video games. A combination of high refresh rate, a responsive image processor and synchronised panel backlighting dramatically reduces ghosting and motion blur for precise motion clarity. Learn more.  Samsung\u2019s Evolution Kit updates your TV to the latest hardware and firmware/software each year. If you purchase a Series 8 television, you\u2019re guaranteed Evolution Kit support \u2013 letting you gain improved hardware (like quad-core processors) and software updates (like gesture control support) \u2013 for five years. And the evolution box easily connects to a special port behind your TV. Learn more.

VThere goes the weekend! Every episode of Community is now streaming exclusively on Stan. To celebrate, here are our favourite 10 episodes ever! What\u2019s your top pick?  Community is a comedy that is ranked as one of the most inventive and original half-hours on television. It centers around friends who all met at what is possibly the world\u2019s worst educational institution \u2013 Greendale Community College. In no particular order, here are our essential eps from season 1 through to 6, now streaming on Stan.\u000aPS. Alison Brie FTW!  Season 3, Episode 20. \u000aPierce and his closest friends are summoned to Hawthorne Labs to play a video game that will determine who inherits his father\u2019s fortune. One of the best ever! An epic 8-bit adventure complete with 80s synth soundtrack. Bonus: LaVar Burton aka Geordi La Forge from Star Trek.   Season 6, Episode 2. \u000aThe Dean purchases a VR system for Greendale that could bankrupt the school, forcing Jeff to find the creator, Elroy Patashnik, to save them. Lots of geeky Virtual Reality jokes here \u2014 with a special nod to The Lawnmower Man.   Season 2, Episode 11. \u000aWhen Abed wakes up to a world in stop-motion animation, he takes it as a sign that he and the group must rediscover the meaning of Christmas. An amazing claymation homage to Christmas specials with references to The Polar Express, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and more.   Season 3, Episode 14. \u000aThe Greendale students are drawn into an epic pillow fight as Troy and Abed start a war that threatens to destroy their friendship. A crazy adventure inside a giant, sprawling pillow fort \u2014 presented in the style of Ken Burns\u2019 documentary, The Civil War.  Season 2, Episodes 23 and 24. \u000aA paintball war pits the study group members against each other for $100,000, but when a mysterious challenger appears, they must join forces to stop him. As the paintball war is revealed to be a City College plan to destroy the school, Jeff and Troy vie for control of Greendale\u2019s embattled army. If you liked the \u2018Modern Warfare\u2019 paintball episode in the first season, you\u2019ll love this double episode season 2 finale. $100,000 is up for grabs as the entire Greendale campus goes to war. Paintball style.   Season 2, Episode 4. \u000aJeff and the study group salvage an ageing museum exhibit that Dean Pelton plans to make the centrepiece of Greendale\u2019s aerospace training program. An hilarious spoof of Apollo 13. What would happen if the Community crew got caught in space? Kind of.   Season 2, Episode 6. \u000aDean Pelton\u2019s army-surplus party food sparks an outbreak of `zombie-ism\u2019 at the Greendale Halloween party. Halloween. Zombies. Yes!  Seasons 2, Episode 14. \u000aSeeing how everyone on campus makes fun of Fat Neil, Jeff decides to do something about it. An emotional, sweet and superb episode that sees the study group change the life of a vulnerable classmate for the better.   Season 3, Episode 3. \u000aWhen Jeff introduces an element of randomness into Troy and Abed\u2019s housewarming party, reality splits into six timelines affecting the group\u2019s relationships. Speaking of dice! A random episode in the best way possible.  Season 5, Episode 5. \u000aAbed\u2019s hot lava fantasy game goodbye to Troy divides Greendale into warring camps. Remember playing this game as a kid? Now imagine an entire school playing along with you!

VLiv Moore is a brain eating undead murder mystery solving doctor with a tangled love life and a penchant for hot sauce. And from today you can binge watch her adventures in iZombie anytime, anywhere on Stan.   You need not worry about having zombie fatigue, as iZombie is a zombie series a little different to most. Here\u2019s why. Fan of Veronica Mars? Party Down? The man behind both those shows also created iZombie, so if you ever wondered what either of those shows would look like with zombies, this is it. \u000aThe cult favourite comic comes to life on screen, with the opening titles giving a nod to the series origin. \u000aKiwi actress Rose McIver plays Liv Moore. After being turned into a zombie she discovers that with each brain she eats, she inherits the corpse\u2019s memories, helping her solve crimes. This ain\u2019t The Walking Dead. Fan of zombies or not, you\u2019ll find something to love about it. The New York Times calls it \u201cridiculously likable\u201d and pretty much every other critic agrees. iZombie has a 91 percent rating on Rotten Tomato.  Even the undead need to find love. Between her ex-fiancée and a banquet of living and/or dead lovers \u2014 let\u2019s just say Liv\u2019s connections are very much alive. \u000aWhen they aren\u2019t keeping Liv alive, or helping her solve crimes, she\u2019s working them into some pretty great dishes (with the a huge serving of hot sauce). \u000aWhile doing his best to find a cure for Liv\u2019s zombie-ness, he\u2019s also dishing up a charm not seen on screen since Jim Halpert in The Office (aka John Krasinksi).  All 13 episodes of iZombie Season One are now available to stream on Stan Don\u2019t fret if you binge through season one this weekend. Stan will fast track season two from October. Same day as the US.  Obligatory "Gizmodo is published by Allure Media, and Fairfax (which forms 50 per cent of the StreamCo/Stan joint venture with Nine) owns Allure Media" missing. If it's advertorial, shouldn't it follow, like all the other advertorials on gizmodo, that you shouldn't' be able to comment on them? Which always annoys me, so I'm glad you can comment here.  Also, show's not bad. Watched it a few months ago. Definitely not great though, but it'll waste some time while you eat tea or something. I can't wait for the second season to come out. Its a good TV show....

Just because it\u2019s the entry level in Samsung\u2019s world of Smart TV doesn\u2019t mean that Series 6 models, such as the D6600 or D6000 are lesser TVs; you\u2019ll still find Samsung\u2019s Smart Hub of services*, exceptional 2D to 3D conversion and the option for simple WiFi connection dongles to help make your Smart TV experience as simple as possible.

V var noskimwords = 'true'; Sponsored post Most of us have roughly the same New Year\u2019s resolutions: lose weight, get in touch with friends more often, and of course, get reading those excellent novels that everyone talks about at dinner parties. Most people would acknowledge that for even the most dedicated bookworm, real life often gets in the way, so it can be difficult to get through even one book without various distractions making you give up long before the end. However, if you\u2019re determined that this year is the year you transform into a literary virtuoso, why not give yourself an extra incentive and invest in the proper tools to do it? Kindles are growing in popularity amongst those who don\u2019t want to have to cart heavy books around, and who also want a few extra features that books simply can\u2019t deliver. So with the January sales looming, now is the time to shop around and save yourself a little extra money. There are a number of Kindle models available, which one you choose is largely dependent upon your own needs. The basic Kindle 1 is a simple e-reader, so is great for anyone looking for a basic model that\u2019s easy to use and won\u2019t break the bank. The Kindle 1 is able to connect to Wikipedia and the Amazon store, but any other web browsing isn\u2019t possible; if you\u2019re looking for something simple that won\u2019t leave home too often, try this, but otherwise a more advanced model may be more suitable. The Kindle 3G is definitely the most high-tech option, offering free Internet connectivity, the option of uploading your own songs and listening to music, and sending and receiving emails for free. This is great for anyone with a busy lifestyle, or for tech-lovers looking for plenty of extra features. The Kindle 4 is the latest model, a slimmed-down, lightweight version of its predecessors. One of the most notable things about the new Kindle is that it doesn\u2019t have a keyboard, instead relying on a virtual keyboard and navigator pad for web browsing and note-taking. It isn\u2019t as advanced as the 3G, and is generally acknowledged to be slightly slower, but this model is great for anyone looking for a cheap, practical option for everyday life. Whichever model you end up with this January, investing in a Kindle is a great way of getting back into reading on a regular basis, as well as indulging in a whole host of fun little features designed to make your life a whole lot easier. Even if you don\u2019t quite make it through War & Peace in 2012, the Kindle\u2019s added extras are a great way of staying on top of your other New Year\u2019s resolutions: looking up exercise plans over the Internet, emailing friends and colleagues, and generally staying more organised. We can\u2019t guarantee it\u2019ll stop any willpower wobbles completely, but it\u2019ll definitely help.

VSponsored post Gone are the days when you had to go into the office to communicate with your colleagues and clients. Thanks to the latest technology these days you can work just as effectively from the comfort of your own home or anywhere in the world for that matter. Flexible working means that you can avoid travelling during rush hour, if the weather is too bad or if there\u2019s a major problem with public transport \u2013 and let\u2019s be honest, there quite often is.  For employees flexible working arrangements mean you can achieve a much better work-life balance and much higher levels of satisfaction while for the organisation you don\u2019t even have to be in the same place or even the same time zone to work together.  On-line tools help to share material, work in progress, market intelligence, knowledge and schedules regardless of where you are in the world. As long as the work gets done, it doesn\u2019t matter where on earth you are, quite literally. According to BT at least 20 per cent of face to face meetings can be subsituted with online alternatives while typically working from home can increase productivity by between 20 and 30 per cent.  Companies such as BBC, Price Waterhouse Coopers and Deloitte have found that sickness rates have also dropped from around 9 per cent to 2.5 per cent since adopting flexible working \u2013 a real win, win all round then! Below in this video we look at flexible working \u2013 what it is and how it can benefit you and your organisation.  Sponsored video

VThis is a sponsored post.  Since mobile phones were first invented around thirty year ago, the technology has changed perhaps faster than we could ever have imagined \u2013 and our phones are now an essential tool to be carried everywhere. We\u2019ve gone from bricks attached to a suitcase to an ultra-thin iPhone 6, sporting a massive, brightly coloured display capable of displaying HD videos\u2026 and yet, when it comes to the humble phone call, things are still pretty similar. It\u2019s bizarre when you think about it \u2013 that as we\u2019ve gone through a number of wifi standards (from 802.11n to 802.11ac) and as bandwidth has increased massively, when we take a call the sound quality still sounds exactly like it did all of those years ago. The reason for this is simple: If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it \u2013 and the GSM standard for connecting audio calls has worked great so far. It\u2019s reliable too \u2013 which can be important as this moving Vodafone film from its \u2018Every Second Counts\u2019 campaign shows: (function() {if (document.readyState === 'complete') return;if (typeof EbuzzingCurrentAsyncId === 'undefined') window.EbuzzingCurrentAsyncId = 0;else EbuzzingCurrentAsyncId++;var containerId = 'buzzPlayer' + EbuzzingCurrentAsyncId;document.write('<d'+'iv id="' + containerId + '"></di'+'v>');var params = {"size" : 15};eval('window.EbuzzingScriptParams_' + containerId + ' = params;');var s = document.createElement('script');s.async = true; s.defer = true;s.src = 'http://as.ebz.io/api/inContent.htm?seedingMode=NORMAL'+String.fromCharCode(38)+'pid=1125865'+String.fromCharCode(38)+'cid=347879'+String.fromCharCode(38)+'target='+containerId+'';var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);})(); But wouldn\u2019t it be better if the quality of the call was more like real life? If Skype can do it, why can\u2019t our phones? The good news is that Vodafone is working away on making this a reality using the power of 4G. Thanks to 4G\u2019s increased bandwidth, it is possible for \u201cVoice over LTE\u201d \u2013 or \u201cVoLTE\u201d for short \u2013 to happen (\u201cLTE\u201d is a technical term for 4G). It\u2019s easier just to call it HD Voice, like everyone else does. The way it works is that rather than have your phone use its GSM capabilities to make calls, it instead uses the 4G radio \u2013 so when you\u2019re calling another 4G user on the same network on a supported phone (most new ones, like the iPhone 6, support it). These newer phones will also automatically switch, so if you enter an area that doesn\u2019t have 3G or 4G, the call can automatically switch back to good old GSM. Given that Vodafone already has 4G coverage in 313 cities, towns and districts, and it is committed to aiming to become the strongest network in Britain \u2013 could we be about to see HD Voice revolution our voice calls at long last?  nice to see that carriers are finally embracing VOIP. They refused for the longest time in fear that customers would use fewer minutes (and in return only use a limited amount of additional data) which would eat into their revenue. Curious whether HD voice consumers a lot of data? (given it\u2019s HD and all) With the lack of unlimited data plan these days this could be a big hidden data draw that users are not aware of James is the Editor of TechDigest.

VStarting, managing and growing your business will likely be one of the toughest challenges you\u2019ll ever face. But the rewards are clear. Financially, and if all goes to plan, for your lifestyle. Here are some tips, tools and ideas to help you strategically consider your day-to-day cash flow and your goals for future growth.  Don\u2019t underrate it: your business plan is the most important tool you have in the early days. It\u2019s your business case to secure finance backing, investors, employees and gauge milestones. \u2022 To help you get started, Bankwest has a number of handy start-up tools, including a small business plan template, financial forecast template, and a pros/cons breakdown of the structure your business might take: sole trader, partnership, company or trust.  Set a day aside to clarify what you want your business to achieve. Be self-critical and play devil\u2019s advocate \u2013 you need more than a great idea, you need a cash flow model. You also need to plan for what your business may yet become. Be sure to address your weaknesses and identify new opportunities as you go, and revisit your business plan every three to six months.  As ever in life, there are legal formalities that must be addressed when getting your business off the ground. From registering the business name, applying for licenses and checking for trademarks to managing your tax/super obligations to finding the best insurance and banking options. Exhausted yet? \u2022 Thankfully, here\u2019s a great red tape checklist for starting a business. Starting a business is exciting, but it\u2019s important that you haven\u2019t forgotten anything.  Cash flow is the pulse of your business, so of course you\u2019ll be monitoring it closely. Further, you should also actively look for ways to improve your marginal cash flow and cash cycle.  \u2022 Bankwest has a cash flow improvement calculator for just this purpose.  \u2022 In addition, this cash flow forecaster will help identify running costs and how much money you\u2019ll need to stay in business all year. Factor in seasonality, look for weaknesses in cash flow, and pay invoices on time.  Marketing your business can be quite creatively rewarding. You might use physical signs and banners to email newsletters or Facebook \u2014 and everything in between.  Invest time to really get to know and understand your customers and how you can give them more of what they want. Supporting your community and fostering word of mouth should never be underrated, but neither should direct marketing methods like emails and texts \u2013 especially if you\u2019re providing exclusive offers. Consider loyalty programs. And never forget the up-sell.  \u2022 How will you get your business noticed? This marketing plan template will help you brainstorm effectively.  What direction do you want to take your business? It\u2019s important to plan ahead and form a clear picture of what you want to achieve.  \u2022 That\u2019s where your business plan template and marketing plan templates become even more important. \u2022 Of course, you\u2019ll need to fund that growth. That means locking down your cash flow.  \u2022 The best businesses are also built on the best people. Your staff are your ambassadors. They\u2019re your engine.

V// <![CDATA[<br />\u000avar noskimwords = true;<br />\u000a// ]]&gt; Sponsored post Businesses cannot function without their phones \u2013 a business phone line is one of the main forms of office communication. For all businesses, selecting the correct phone package is vital in ensuring successful communication and therefore building a successful business. So what phone packages are available for businesses? And what considerations should be made? Business phone packages are designed to offer great rates on calls and other services in order to facilitate business processes and functions. The type of package selected is dependent on the type and frequency of use that is likely to occur. When selecting phone systems for business purposes it is important to consider the following things: Type of Calls The first question that needs to be asked is whether your business will only need to make national calls or whether international calls will also be a common occurrence. This will determine what sort of call rates and packages you need to look for.  A number of packages will offer competitive rates for both international and national calls, but spending money on something which offers cheap international calls you\u2019ll never make is futile. Amount and Frequency of Calls The amount of and frequency of calls you are likely to make will also determine the type of business phone package you need. If you are likely to make a high volume of calls on a frequent basis then you will need a package which offers a reliable service with fiercely competitive rates. \u000aPhone Line Establishing a good quality business telephone line is essential for ensuring that your communicative lines are always open. Business phone lines are designed to over a reliable and uninterrupted service which will only be beneficial for your company. \u000aStandard lines are predominantly designed for the transferral of voice communication along with the ability to connect to fax machines. They can also be used to receive broadband services, which is another great asset for businesses.  Many business phone lines will come with a range of added features and benefits, such as: land line features; line rentals offered at lowered prices; calling bundles and extra features; highly affordable and competitive rates for call charges; and online billing. Phone Systems\u000aBusiness phone systems can also be varied, so it is important to consider which will be best suited to your businesses\u2019 needs. Some of the most recent types of phone system include those which work via an IP connection, something which is known as Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP. These systems are particularly popular for connecting offices to one and other and can also be utilised by people who work from home.\u000a\u000aBroadband and Other Services\u000aOther features of call packages, including broadband services, can be added in order to enhance the communicative links of businesses.

p232
VThe 2014 World Cup in Brazil was, without question, the most technologically advanced ever. In short, it was the first seriously competitive international tournament to employ technology in a number of new ways \u2013 the most obvious being goal-line technology of course.  And with so much at stake in major football competitions these days, it seems a given that technology should be used to its fullest effect to iron out human errors \u2013 in much the same way as it has been used in both types of rugby, tennis, cricket, snooker, squash and other sports for a number of years now. In short, sports fans yearn for definitive results over crucial decisions \u2013 findings which are completely unequivocal whenever possible. Even the previously feared delays in play have become part and parcel of the entertainment; rugby league fans cheer on the \u201ctry / no-try\u201d video referee\u2019s decisions, and the same happens each Wimbledon over Hawk-Eye\u2019s line calls. At the same time, sports fans don\u2019t want to see too much technology employed for its own sake \u2013 nor any unnecessary delays in play. In other words \u2013 technology should be kept for the really big decisions only. In some sports areas, as with \u201ctry / no-try\u201d video ref decisions in rugby league, for example, there is sometimes a qualitative judgement element involved. This would be the case in football, for example, if technology were to be used for penalty decisions, sendings-off, bookings, free kicks or offside decisions etc. In these cases, it would be a matter for some kind of video referee to be making decisions whilst play continued, overriding the on-pitch referee\u2019s decisions only when necessary. But this kind of remote qualitative override decision seems a long way off \u2013 such has been the resistance to introducing technology in football even at the goal-line level. It was, perhaps, Frank Lampard\u2019s disallowed long-range \u201cequalizer\u201d for England against Germany in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa that helped usher in goal-line technology by FIFA in time for Brazil 2014. Lampard\u2019s shot crashed off the underside of the crossbar, clearly crossing the line by a couple of feet, yet was disallowed by the referee who wasn\u2019t in a great position to see it. Inexplicably, the linesman who was in a good position, kept his flag down. This was just before half-time and would have meant England had turned around a two-goal deficit. It would also, of course, have changed the whole complexion of the match at a crucial juncture. As it was, the England players went in at half-time feeling utterly dejected. Obviously, the application of goal-line technology would have meant fair play was ensured and the match was so high-profile, and the human decision so glaringly inaccurate, that FIFA had to acknowledge that technology could have been helpful. After testing various competing systems, FIFA announced in 2012 that it would introduce a \u201cGoalControl\u201d camera-based technology system in time for the 2013 Confederations Cup \u2013 and as a test-bed for the World Cup the following year. This all came to pass and the 4D GoalControl system, which employs 14 ultra high-speed cameras in each stadium was used in Brazil. Ironically, GoalControl is a German company. Their system fits seven high-speed cameras covering each goalmouth to each stadium roof. These are linked to an image-processing computer, which filters out any non-ball shaped objects and accurately plots the ball\u2019s position. It is accurate to within a couple of millimeters. France became the first nation in a World Cup to benefit from GoalControl\u2019s goal-line technology, when their second goal, by Karim Benzema, over Honduras was proven to have crossed the line. France went on to win the match 3-0. Meanwhile the English Football Association also introduced goal-line technology in time for the Premier League\u2019s 2013-14 season, using the competing technology \u201cHawk-Eye\u201d (as used at Wimbledon). So, with clear precedents in place in major national and international tournaments, it seems rather odd, to say the least, that the world\u2019s biggest club tournament currently uses no technology whatsoever. Ironically, perhaps, the Champions League features heavily in the list of the best tech sports video games ever, yet doesn\u2019t currently employ any technology itself in assisting the referees. The attention on the Champions League seems to grow each year. It is a multi-million dollar business with the top teams from the top leagues fighting it out through the winter to see who emerges as the continent\u2019s best during May. Last season\u2019s winners, Real Madrid, are arguably the biggest club in the world. They recently splashed the cash buying the World Cup\u2019s Golden Boot winner, James Rodriguez, from Monaco for around 90 million euros, to play alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, for whom they paid 100 million euros last year. So why is it, that with so much at stake, the Champions League remains open to the kind of costly errors we\u2019ve seen in other major competitions? Well, bizarrely, it\u2019s a question of cost according to UEFA\u2019s French President, Michel Platini. Monsieur Platini is on record as stating that he does want a goal-line technology system in place in his own country in time for the Euro 2016 tournament. But when it comes to the Champions League, it seems the anticipated c. £40 million price tag is too high \u2013 and Platini believes the cash would be better spent on grassroots projects. He has a valid point and most football fans believe in grassroots development of the game. But at a relatively measly £40 million, the Champions League seems woefully out of tech-step with the rest of big tournament football around the globe. Surely, the introduction of goal-line technology has now paved the way for further developments to assist the referees. And as we saw in Brazil, football fans enjoy the spectacle even more when there is less room for doubt.

p234
VChances are you\u2019ve heard of Windows Azure and know that it\u2019s some sort of cloud-based solution. But why do we need it and what new opportunities does it open up for developers? There\u2019s a lot of arguing in the IT community over what exactly comprises cloud computing, but the basic concept is pretty simple: access to computing resources as and when you need them. Consider the example of a company that sells tickets to major events. At the point when tickets go on sale, there will be thousands of people simultaneously trying to access its site. If the company runs its own servers and hosting environment, it will need to pay for enough capacity to handle that maximum load, even though it isn\u2019t used 90% of the time. That approach means massively overspending on IT equipment and the staff needed to keep it running, simply to deal with occasional peaks in demand. If that company instead uses a cloud computing environment, it can adopt a pay-as-you-go approach. When its site is relatively quiet, costs will be lower. When that major event goes on sale, additional computing resources can immediately be made available by the cloud provider, ensuring the site performs without interruption. The ticketing company will pay more for those additional processing cycles, but its overall expenditure can still be far lower. Meanwhile, the business offering the hosted cloud environment can share those resources amongst multiple clients, ensuring more efficient utilisation and lower costs for everyone. The ticket seller (or any other business) can also concentrate its IT efforts on the factors that make its business unique, rather than simply \u201ckeeping the lights on\u201d in its server system. Windows Azure takes that concept and applies it with technologies that are already familiar to developers and IT managers around the world: the Windows family of operating systems, SQL Server as a database and the Microsoft Visual Studio environment used to create robust applications. Backed with the technological and financial strength of Microsoft, that creates a cloud environment that is reliable, globally available and ready for the future, and which you don\u2019t need to learn coding from scratch to utilise. After several years of internal development, Windows Azure was made generally available to developers in January 2010. Azure operates from six data centres worldwide (two in the US, two in Singapore, and two in the Asia-Pacific: Hong Kong and Singapore). While it\u2019s reassuring to know that there\u2019s a solid infrastructure and clear service delivery guidelines behind Windows Azure, developers don\u2019t need more than their existing skills to get started on building Azure applications, whether that\u2019s for their own business or to offer as a service to others. Any Azure developer can immediately start using the familiar .Visual Studio environment and the .NET framework to begin building applications. If you want to use Ruby or Java, you can also do that via the AppFabric middleware framework (which we\u2019ll revisit in detail in a future instalment). And there\u2019s a free trial edition available, so you can see how well Windows Azure works for you without needing to commit to a big up-front spend. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll be covering the key tools you need to get started with Azure, talking to existing Azure developers and experts to get their insights into making the most of the Azure opportunity, and telling you about a series of special events we\u2019re holding to encourage and inspire Azure development.

V var noskimwords = 'true'; Sponsored post Part of the attraction of Diesel watches is that, while everyone is aware of their quality and style, they don\u2019t have that tasteless \u2018showy-off\u2019 element that so many other brands subscribe to in order to get more attention. Latest Diesel watches are incredibly understated, allowing their superior design to do all the talking for them. Indeed, a watch brand that\u2019s championed by Madonna and Julia Roberts doesn\u2019t really have to go about shouting from the rooftops. And, just like the famous actor at a party who knows everyone there is aware of his fame, a diesel watch doesn\u2019t really need to introduce itself. The company\u2019s Oversized analogue watch is a perfect example of this. Available in black, white or red, it has a circular clock and a 200 mm circumference, giving it a funky, chunky, vintage feel. Stripping things down to basics, \u201902 03 04\u2032 are the only visible numbers along the right, with an extra second measurement on the other half. This, along with the small diesel logo, makes a serious but subtle statement and gives this timepiece a real sense of class. All colours, the white especially, would look great on a man or woman and the stripped down vintage style ensures that it would go with just about anything. The DZ12076 with brown leather strap is another analogue, though more of a gentleman\u2019s watch than its colleague. A polished stainless steel clock and rough leather strap give it a rugged feel, while a circular face holds an aesthetically pleasing triangular feature on the right. On here we find the diesel logo and \u201910bar\u2019 water resistance subtly encrusted, a nice touch that, again, isn\u2019t too showy. There\u2019s a lot more on this watch\u2019s face than the Oversized, with a second counter from 1-60 and a measurement of its water resistance around the outside. However, an absence of numbers, aside from a large 12 at the top, means it still features that stripped down minimalism. Diesel watches \u2013 just like other areas of the company\u2019s vast product line \u2013 display all the elements that have made the brand what it is today. A mix of functionality and minimalist cool make them must-haves all year round. There are many watches in a relatively affordable price range. however, if want to spend less money you have to be careful not to go for the fashion watches.

VStart the party wherever you are. You\u2019ve got the music on your phone or other Bluetooth device. Now flip open your Bose SoundLink Wireless Mobile speaker, and get things going with bigger sound than you thought you could get from a speaker this small. Bose has created a mini masterpiece in the Soundlink Mobile Speaker. It combines a stunning, intelligent design with Bose\u2019s traditional excellence in audio. By using Bluetooth as the wireless standard instead of Wi-Fi, Bose has not only created a speaker a speaker that can truly be taken anywhere, but one that plays back music from a huge range of devices. While most portable speakers today are somewhat limited by the inclusion of an iPod dock, the Bluetooth standard lets the Soundlink Mobile Speaker connect wirelessly to not just Apple devices, but Android smartphones and tablets, BlackBerry phones, laptops and other computers, or any other Bluetooth enabled device. Simply press and hold the Bluetooth button on the top of the speaker, and then choose the Soundlink option from the Bluetooth devices on your phone or PC. The devices are now paired, and will automatically connect again every time the speaker is turned on and the phone is within the 10 metre range. It can also remember up to six different devices, making it perfect for the whole extended family. Because Bose passionately created the Soundlink as a portable music solution for everyone, they had to create innovative technologies to deliver a full range of sound \u2013 from deep bass to detailed high notes \u2013 without using heavy subwoofers or large ports. Bose created specialised passive radiators, which is how they can get the deep bass notes from a speaker just 5cm thick that weighs less than 1.5kg. The careful design includes either a dark grey nylon cover \u2014 or a premium trim with dark brown leather cover. These fold out to become the speaker\u2019s stand, making it truly portable, without needing any bulky accessories. A 3.5mm auxiliary port on the back also allows for music playback without a Bluetooth connection. The Soundlnk Mobile Speaker is powered by a Lithium-ion battery, which gives up to eight hours worth of playback, depending on how loud you\u2019re playing your music. Getting the same battery life from your smartphone may be a bit more challenging. Once the Soundlink\u2019s battery has run out, the included charger will charge it up in about three hours. Prices start at just $449 for the dark-grey nylon covered version, or $499 for the premium dark brown leather version. For the combination of superior sound, compact and lightweight design and stylish looks, that\u2019s great value, whichever way you look at it.  As we head into the longer days of Summer, the Soundlink Mobile Speaker is the perfect accessory for music lovers of all smartphone persuasions. [Bose Australia]

V\u000a Sponsored post   As the launches of the PS4\u000aand Xbox One near the early signs are showing that there could be a record\u000aamount of sales running up to the Christmas period and beyond.   At the Tokyo Game Show\u000aearlier this year, Sony\u2019s top bosses announced that they hoped sales would\u000areach 5 million by 31 March 2014. Combine this with the tight competition by\u000aXbox One and early\u000apredictions had sales at 10 million by at least March 2014.   However, pre-order sales\u000ahave risen above all expectations for both consoles and the sales could reach this\u000amark a lot sooner. Pre orders in Britain for the PS4 have taken up a lion\u2019s\u000ashare of the list according to Sony Computer Entertainment\u2019s Vice President and\u000aManaging Director for the UK, Fergal Gara. \u000a   It also forced Gara\u000ato show his hand and explain that pre-orders already in place are \u2018almost\u000acertain\u2019 to get their hands on the console before Christmas.    Without a pre-order gamers\u000amay be waiting beyond the fiscal year before they can walk into a high street\u000aretailer and purchase one of the new consoles straight from the shelf. GAME are still taking\u000apre-orders for PS4s and with just a £20 deposit they are guaranteeing that it\u000awill be delivered before Christmas \u2013 as long as you place your order soon!   The PS4 has every reason\u000ato be dominating most of the attention in the tech world with many new features\u000afor all Sony fans to enjoy.    With a new generation of\u000agaming including enhanced graphics and social features with an improved\u000aPlayStation Store that learns from the individual gamer, Sony\u2019s promises are\u000ahigh.    This console is set to be\u000athe most personally defined in the world. As well as this the much derided PS3\u000aDualshock controller gets a severe upgrade from a more responsive, light and\u000acomfortable gaming experience.  The welcome addition of\u000aRemote Play with the PlayStation Vita will also provide a new and unknown\u000adimension for PlayStation fans.   There is also further\u000aexcitement as games exclusive to the new console will be released beside it\u000asuch as DriveClub, Knack, The Crew and The Division.\u000aWith exclusive gaming experience, the normal \u2018wait for a year\u2019 attitude when\u000abuying a new console has changed as the PS4 is instantly showing what it can\u000ado.    With demand increasing by\u000athe day as the launch nears, there is only a short time before avid gamers will\u000aget their hands on this coveted console.   All prices true at time of writing.   Sources for client reference: http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/10/30/ea-predicts-ps4-and-xbox-one-launch-sales\u000a

V The best camera available is the one you have with you, and the Galaxy S5 packs great camera specs \u2014 twice the megapixels of the iPhone 5s. Let\u2019s look at some of the GS5\u2019s features that help capture memories in vivid detail, including phase detection auto focus (usually reserved for DSLRs), selective auto focus and smart HDR preview. All brought to life by a Full HD Super AMOLED screen.   As you can see in the videos above and below, the Samsung Galaxy S5 helps enhance photos before and after you take your picture. Turn on the HDR (High Dynamic Range / rich tone) setting when there\u2019s a strong counter light \u2014 or when the subject you\u2019re shooting is shaded \u2014 and you\u2019ll be able to preview the adjustment in real time, improving your photo\u2019s lighting and colour balance before you\u2019ve even taken it.  Afterwards, Selective Focus allows you to control the depth of field and focus point, blurring the background and accentuating the main subject in defined detail.  The Galaxy S5 features Phase Detection Autofocus to quickly refocus what you\u2019re shooting and help capture fast movement with clarity\u2026  \u000aLearn about the Galaxy S5\u2019s photo capabilities at Samsung Australia\u2019s website.\u000a  This is Samsung\u2019s brightest and most defined phone screen to-date.

The GS5 screen automatically adjusts when you find yourself under the sun or too much light. And in the dark, the Galaxy S5 can dim more than ever to help your eyes feel comfortable in the dark.

The choice is no longer as simple as choosing an\u000aappropriately-spec\u2019d desktop PC, with contemporary computing now offering a\u000avariety of other, more portable options such as laptops and tablets. UK-based\u000acomputer manufacturer Novatech is all\u000atoo aware of the shifting needs of consumers as they transition from desktop\u000acomputing to something more portable.

VRunning is one of the best things you can do for your health. In fact, a recent study found that running for just a few minutes a day lowers the risk of an untimely demise by 30 percent. That said, there is a good way to run and a better way to run. So make the most of your run with these cool and new technologies.  Image courtesy of Shutterstock  Like many other headphones designed with athleticism in mind, these are wireless, waterproof and sand and dust resistant. But what sets these apart is the inbuilt heart rate monitor which delivers stats at clinical-grade accuracy.  For anyone serious about running, heart rate monitors are pretty important. If you\u2019re heart rate is not in the right zone, it can be hard to achieve your fitness, strength or weight-loss goals. This is where the Sports Pulse earbuds really shine \u2014 they come with a companion app and together these tools can help you make sure that you\u2019re training in the correct heart rate zone. They also help you track and evaluate your progress. It\u2019s also worth noting that these Jabra headphones won an Innovation Award at this year\u2019s CES.  You can have all the fitness gadgets in the world, but let\u2019s face it, if you have the wrong runners, you\u2019re gonna have a bad time. Ill-fitting shoes cannot only hinder your fitness progress but they can straight up hurt you! For real.  The Athlete\u2019s Foot have a nifty little walk-on device called FITZI® that combines video and pressure mapping. FITZI has more than 4000 sensors to analyse the pressure points on your foot, while the video footage helps determine the level of support required. The result is a shoe that is tailored to your specific foot and running requirements.  If you\u2019re one of the 66 percent of Australians that experience aching feet every month, then it\u2019s totally worth giving this a go. And if you\u2019re not, try it anyway for funzies.  Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you would have heard about this recent release of the Apple Watch. We all know what it is, we all know the basics of what it can do. But \u2014 now that some of the best fitness apps have developed versions for the Apple Watch \u2014 it is now a pretty good piece of technology for all the runners out there. Top rated running apps like Runtastic, Nike+Running and Strava are available on Watch OS and there are only more to come. These apps will help you track your speed, distance, time and calories burned, so you can make the absolute most of every run. Just in case you want another reason to get an Apple Watch, Beyoncé has one. She wore it to Coachella.  Once again Skins are changing the realm of sportswear. The pioneers of compression wear, Skins garments allow more oxygen into the muscle for an overall better performance and faster recovery when exercising.  Recently, they\u2019ve redesigned their A400 line for men and women and included a number of technological innovations. The new construction of the Skins A400 is designed to deliver the most precise compression possible and to ensure that compression levels are tailored for the active body. In addition to compression, the A400 wear now use muscle wrapping and temperature control technologies that help reduce muscle soreness, fatigue and injury. 	 If you\u2019re serious about running, then you\u2019ll want to at least take a look at the new designs. This interactive tool will show you everything you need to know.   Ain\u2019t nobody got time for sore, achy feet. Especially runners. Which is why Saucony has developed their ISOFIT technology. ISOFIT technology works through the integration of stretchable air-mesh sleeve and floating support cage into the shoe. Together, the sleeve and cage allow the shoe to have a dynamic fit \u2014 unceasingly adapting and morphing to the shape of your foot.  ISOFIT also means that the shoe is pretty damn comfy. The shoe feels more like a sock than anything else. And the 20 percent more cushioning makes you feel like you\u2019re walking on a cloud! If you\u2019re serious about running, you should probably check these out!  For those who like to run with company, sometimes holding a leash in your hand can interrupt your flow and just generally make your run a hassle. Fortunately enough, one dog lover out there invented the hands free dog lead. This one by DOOG is a great option.  The Dog Walkie belt sits securely and firmly around the waist and is suitable for dogs of all sizes. One testimonial says that it was secure enough to use with a 35 kilo German Sheppard. Along with a carabineer for attaching your lead, it includes an iPod/iPhone clip, tennis baller holder and several secure pouches for storing keys and cash. What gadgets help you with your exercise routine? Let us know in the comments.

VVisual Studio 11 adds a stack of new and helpful features to Microsoft\u2019s flagship development environment. You can download a free trial copy of the beta right now; here are five reasons why you should. Metro-style apps for Windows 8 bring a whole new approach to the desktop, offering a beautiful interface which maximises the experience of each individual app and takes advantage of modern processing power and Windows 8\u2019s feature set. Visual Studio 11 offers the easiest path into Windows 8 development via Visual Studio Express for Windows 8. The Visual Studio interface has cut back on the number of default toolbar commands, and only uses colour for notifications and status changes. By de-emphasising the development environment, you can focus on your own application, rather than being distracted by the environment itself. Preview Tabs also let you access debugging information and other documents without needing large numbers of unwanted documents open. Visual Studio 11 includes tools for the entire development process, from designing the overall architecture to creating the user interface and testing and deployment. Application lifecycle management via Team Foundation Server allows large teams to collaborate seamlessly across complex projects. Modern applications increasingly rely on pervasive network connections. The enhanced .NET 4.5 networking libraries fully support WebSockets and the full HTTP standard, ensuring you can make the most of networked environments. Whether you want to work in JavaScript, C++, C#, Visual Basic, Visual F#, Python or Ruby, Visual Studio can help. Make your choice based on the language that meets your needs, not the restrictions of your development environment. If you like what you try, there\u2019s never been a better time to sign up for MSDN, locking in your full copy of the final version (and a host of other developer resources) for a great price.  Didn't realise VS11 was going to be Eclipse! Pft, Eclipse, i unfortunately had to use that for uni, and thankfully, im now onto VS. Eclipse just was a pain to get working. Does intellisense work yet? No? Screw it then. the  intellisense does work

VWhat\u2019s better than doing the whole tourist thing? Travelling like you know the place. Here\u2019s our pick of the top quirky destinations and travel hacks to have you exploring the United Kingdom like you\u2019ve been there a thousand times \u2014 even if it\u2019s your first time. Travel Tips with Lifehacker is presented in partnership with Visa, the easier and more secure way to take your money overseas. With Visa you can behave like a traveller, #notatourist.  There are the usual suspects when it comes to travel destinations (castles, formal gardens, more castles, rocky beaches), and then there are these quirky spots that you really should be adding to your itinerary. The people who run The Forbidden Corner reckon it\u2019s the strangest place in the world. They might be right. Underground chambers, tunnels, giant carved boulders, maze-like gardens, a pyramid of molten glass and weird statues make up this property in the Yorkshire Dales. Even the locals think it is bizarre. You could walk around slack-jawed in confusion and still no one would know you are a tourist.  The Crooked House is, well, crooked because of mining in the 1800s. One side of the building is a full four feet lower than the other, but the floors are level. It makes for some great optical illusions. Grab a pint, bring a ping pong ball, and watch the former slide across your table and the latter roll uphill.\u000a Discovered in the 18th century, no one knows how old it is, who made it, or why. Royston Cave is a man-made cavern with a huge range of medieval style wall carvings featuring the crucifixion, saints and pagan symbols. Theories for who used it range from the Knights Templar to the Freemasons. Avoid local school holidays, as it gets pretty packed with kids.\u000a Depending on who you speak to, Mother Shipton was either a legitimate Nostradamus-like figure predicting the future, or just a reclusive old woman who told people stories that they believed. One thing that can be agreed on is that the cave where she lived for much of her 73 years is amazing. The well has natural petrifying properties that turn ordinary object to stone, and is the only one of it\u2019s kind in England.  Do as the locals do and pack a picnic. There\u2019s some lovely spots by the river, parking is cheap, and the pub food is probably best avoided.\u000a It\u2019s the place with the longest name in the world. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s in Wales.  Pop into one of the local cafes for a good meal, and if you really want to blend in (or just impress some people), watch the video below so you can pronounce the name!\u000a You know where to go, now here\u2019s how to not stand out as a wide eyed tourist.\u000a\u000a1. Learn The Lingo\u000a\u000aAh, the beauty of the English language. Take \u201cdo\u201d. It can mean a party (I\u2019m going to a do, I need to get some shoes), to sell something (Do you do shoes? I\u2019m going to a do) or it can describe if you\u2019re being arrested (The cops are gonna do you for those shoes and you\u2019re gonna miss the do). It\u2019s pretty close to Aussie, you should be fine.   \u000a2. Layer Your Clothes\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not always cold and grey in the UK, but it\u2019s definitely not always sunny. Be prepared for any weather by layering your clothing. Invest in some thermals before you leave.   \u000a3. Pick Up An Oyster Card\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s like the Opal card in Sydney, or they Myki in Melbourne, except it works. An Oyster card is the cheapest way to get around London on public transport, and has a cap for how much each day can cost you. Be sure to stand to the right on the escalators for the tube \u2013 walkers go to the left in the UK.  \u000a4. Stay At A B&B\u000a\u000aWe recommend staying at a B&B, they do excellent full English breakfasts and it\u2019s a great chance to get to know the local hosts and hotspots. If you\u2019re travelling with a Visa card, you can use it at a local ATM (there are millions worldwide) to get cash out for your stay, so your money is safe and your accommodation easily paid for \u2014 even if they don\u2019t take card.  \u000a5. Don\u2019t Go To Stonehenge\u000a\u000aI know, I know, it\u2019s on your bucket list. But what used to be a great place to walk among the stones is now a disappointing photo opportunity from behind a fence. And you can\u2019t get more touristy than that.   Travel Tips with Lifehacker is presented in partnership with Visa, the easier and more secure way to take your money overseas. With Visa you can behave like a traveller, #notatourist.

V Motorola is shaking up the smartphone market with the drop of two new MOTOBLUR handsets \u2013 DEXT and BACKFLIP \u2013 built on the Android mobile OS. But just what exactly is MOTOBLUR, how does it work, and why should we care? What is it? MOTOBLUR is \u201cthe first and only mobile experience to deliver your social life straight to your mobile phone, in the one handy stream.\u201d Powered by Android and developed in-house by Motorola, MOTOBLUR features a multi-layered, personalised home screen that houses customisable widgets. How does it work? When you purchase a MOTOBLUR handset for the first time, the phone will prompt you to create a MOTOBLUR account, which you log in to just once for the life of the phone after you\u2019ve added all your social networking services, such as Twitter, Facebook, Picasa, etc. Your MOTOBLUR account automatically syncs contacts and streams status updates, tweets, emails and messages to your handset, which can then be accessed directly from the home screen. MOTOBLUR even links contacts together by proactively looking for \u201chandles\u201d or data that may suggest that two separate contacts are the one and same person. Kinda like Xobni. But what happens if you lose the phone? Or it gets stolen? MOTOBLUR backs up contacts, customisations, emails, tweets and messages on its secure server. So if you happen to lose your phone, or it gets stolen, you just jump onto the owner\u2019s online portal, locate the phone with aGPS trackers, and do a remote wipe of the phone if necessary. When you move to another MOTOBLUR phone, simply enter your login details, and all your personal information and customisations will sync up exactly the way you had it. Why should we care? MOTOBLUR mashes with Android to equip users with the ideal platform for both content creating and content consuming. If you\u2019re looking for a smartphone that can handle all your social networking demands, DEXT and BACKFLIP have a lot to offer, and they\u2019re available now exclusively through Optus on a range of new plans.

For IT managers, it means a quantum shift in how IT systems and infrastructure are designed, implemented and maintained. And that means a thirst for skilled IT practitioners that can look at how current systems work, look at how they could work in a virtualised, cloud environment and then provide advice to management on how to make the transition. Just to be clear, what we\u2019re talking about is using hosted services that deploy virtual servers. Microsoft\u2019s solution, Azure, delivers the physical infrastructure, virtual infrastructure and development platform to support businesses that want to run key applications in the cloud. You can easily try out Azure free for 90 days \u2014 click here to get started. The IT business doesn\u2019t stay still. Whether you\u2019re an infrastructure specialist or developer, it\u2019s important to continue to build new skills so that you\u2019re ready for the next course correction. Until the 80s, IT systems were centralised: it was all about mainframes and dumb terminals. The PC revolution put processing power on the desk with servers providing centralised storage. Today, we\u2019re in the middle of a shift that sees processing distributed across both centralised and decentralised systems. So why do you need to learn Azure skills? After all, you could hit the books and do courses on other virtualisation and cloud solutions. Microsoft\u2019s Azure solution includes the data centres, virtualised environments and developer tools. That means it has the capacity to become a one-stop-shop for businesses rate than having to piece together hardware, hypervisor and development solutions form multiple vendors. To be able to capitalise on that opportunity, businesses will be looking for cloud-savvy staff. If you\u2019ve got the skills, you\u2019ll be able to ride that wave rather than getting dumped because you weren\u2019t ready. Let\u2019s not forget that Microsoft\u2019s global market share for operating systems is the largest and that Hyper-V is showing faster growth than other hypervisors: recent research suggests that Hyper-V penetration is growing at about three times the rate of VMware. Microsoft offers the Windows Azure Platform Training Kit that provides labs, demos and presentations for using each part of the Azure platform including Windows Azure, SQL Azure and the Windows Azure AppFabric.  The kit is free and updated regularly. To work through the labs, set up a free Windows Azure Platform trial. What certifications can I get to demonstrate my skills? If you\u2019ve worked through the Windows Azure Platform Training Kit you\u2019ll probably want to ensure that your new skills are recognised. Microsoft offers exams and certification for professionals that are Azure-savvy. If you head over to the Windows Azure Training centre you can find a bunch of resources including online training, exams, learning plans and books. Microsoft have promised to answer questions from readers, so if there\u2019s something else you want to know about any aspect of the platform, pop it in the comments and we\u2019ll have the answers in a future post. Picture by Timothy Allena  The article could do with a proof read instead of a spell check.\u000aEven in my current sleep deprived state "rate" should be "rather" and "form" should be "from". If you didn't want this to read like an add, you could mention one of the many competitors to azure, like AWS which is more mature and more flexible.

V Motorola\u2019s popped back up on the smartphone radar in a big way \u2013 they\u2019ve recently announced that there\u2019ll be no less than 20 new handsets released worldwide this year, and two have just been launched in Australia. One of them is BACKFLIP, and it\u2019s set to give the smartphone market a run for its money. BACKFLIP has the goods inside and out, with a top-notch list of specs hidden inside a graceful chassis: super-fast 3G, Wi-Fi connectivity, stereo Bluetooth, a 5MP camera with LED flash, aGPS, 2GB memory expandable to 32GB and a high-res, 3.1-inch touchscreen. BACKFLIP also features a QWERTY keyboard with backlight, which is welcome in a market where physical keyboards are fast being overtaken by touchscreen-only phones. You don\u2019t have to be a texting addict to know that there\u2019s a big difference. Where the handset really comes into its own is in the form factor. As you may have worked out, BACKFLIP backflips into table-top mode, letting you watch videos or view photos with the screen comfortably propped up. The handset also brings a unique BACKTRACK touch panel behind the screen, so you can scroll and have your fingers out of the bloody way. BACKFLIP runs on a mash-up of MOTOBLUR and Android, which means customisation, customisation, customisation! It also means access to over 20,000 apps on the Android Market, and live streaming of whatever you want straight to the home screen \u2013 status updates, emails, Facebook wall posts, news feeds, whatever you like. It also means you\u2019ve run out of excuses for not updating your status often enough\u2026 BACKFLIP and its sister phone DEXT are leading the charge for Motorola in Australia this year, and they\u2019ve partnered up exclusively with Optus to make it happen.

VSetting up a home theatre used to be hard work. It used to involve professional installers, metres of cabling and hours of working out where to plug in your different devices. But those days are gone with the Bose Lifestyle 135.  Offering uncompromised audio quality in a single 1.1 solution, Bose has developed a series of patented technologies to create one of the most advanced soundbars on the market. By leveraging its advanced PhaseGuide array and TrueSpace technologies, Bose is able to deliver wide, sweeping audio from a single visible speaker. With an emphasis on simplicity, Bose\u2019s Lifestyle 135 is friendly enough for anybody to install, let alone use. The Unify intelligent integration system holds the users\u2019 hand as they connect the different elements of their home theatre setup, with the Lifestyle system recommending the best connectors using on-screen messages, and then confirming when the connections have been made correctly.   There\u2019s no fiddling with pesky menus to discover different components \u2013 the Lifestyle 135 intelligently knows when you\u2019ve connected a Blu-ray player to the device. When selecting which input to watch, it will only show you devices that are plugged in, rather than making you cycle through every connection on the back. The Unify technology on board will even let the Lifestyle system control your different devices using the Bose RF remote. A single HDMI cable connects the soundbar to the control console, but more impressive is the fact that the tiny Acoustimass subwoofer connects to the system wirelessly, allowing you to place it away out of sight while still enjoying the rich, deep bass it delivers from its deceptively small body.  Once the system is plugged in and the sources are connected, Bose\u2019s AdaptiQ calibration system intelligently analyses the dimensions of your room, including things like furniture that absorb sound, and intelligently adjusts the speaker\u2019s output to best deliver surround sound to everybody. The soundbar itself comes with one more big surprise. While it can be wall mounted like traditional soundbars, delivering immersive sound by pushing sound forward towards the listener, the advanced technologies introduced by Bose in this system allows it to be laid on a cabinet, flat on its back, and still deliver a truly breathtaking surround sound experience for an entire room.  The groundbreaking Bose Soundbar solution is available in two options. Firstly, the Cinemate 1 SR, which includes the slim speaker unit and the Acoustimass subwoofer module, is available to users just wanting to boost the sound quality of their current home theatre setup.  For users who want a more immersive experience, the Lifestyle 135 includes a control console for connecting up to six different devices, including four HDMI connections and two HD audio ports. It also bundles in an iPod dock and can handle 3D video playback.  For $3,699 including GST, the Lifestyle 135 system is a groundbreaking piece of technology capable of turning any room into an immersive home theatre, without messy cables or complicated setups.

VWith the holidays fast approaching, it\u2019s important to start to plan your trip. If you\u2019re thinking of travelling domestically, a portable GPS device can be your best friend on the road in an unfamiliar town.   With so many portable GPS devices on the market often the major difference is the maker of the maps inside. Whereis® maps cover more than 99 per cent of the places people live in Australia. Before travelling you can program your final destination as well as log and pre-plan stop-overs along the way. Your portable navigation device will also help you find the landmark, such as local tourist information centre, hotel, service station or bank you may need along the way.   Selected devices also allow you to search business listings to find the business or place, such as a hotel in that coastal town that you\u2019d like to travel to, and use their device to call and book before arrival. So make sure you choose a device with Whereis® maps, who knows where it will take you this summer? Footnote: Garmin, TomTom and Uniden all feature Whereis® maps. Make sure you keep an eye out for their devices.

V\u000a Sponsored post Forewarned is forearmed when it comes to protection against\u000aonline security threats. This is why Symantec Website Security\u000aSolutions has created an easy-to-follow Malware Infographic\u000ato raise awareness about the hazards posed by malicious software; and to\u000aprovide tips to avoid the pitfalls.  Online threats Malware is malicious software which damages, disables or\u000adisrupts computers and computer systems, usually to gain access to sensitive\u000amaterial such as passwords and financial details; or even to gain control of\u000athe computer itself. It is a wide term that\u000acovers not only computer viruses like Trojan horses (which pretend to be useful\u000asoftware until after installation), worms (which replicate themselves and can\u000aspread through people\u2019s email address books) and spyware (which secretly records\u000aand transmits the activities of a computer back to fraudsters). Unfortunately, the number of malware attacks is increasing,\u000awith Symantec\u2019s Internet Security Threat Report in April 2012 revealing it had\u000ablocked more than 5.5 billion malware attacks in 2011, an 81% increase compared\u000ato 2010. Be informed, stay safe and share the knowledge It also identified 403 million new variants of malware in\u000a2011, a 41% increase on 2010.    Be informed, stay\u000asafe and share the knowledge According to the Malware  Infographic, 61% of malicious sites\u000awhich spread malware are just regular websites that have been compromised while\u000a36% of websites scanned by Symantec are vulnerable to the risk of malware. This\u000amakes the threats to businesses both difficult to identify and numerous.  However, the infographic also shows where the majority of\u000athese malware threats come from as well as gives advice about how to exercise\u000aprecaution when online and receiving unsolicited emails; making it an\u000aindispensible guide to help the savvy web user keep their computer and website malware-free.  One piece of advice outlined is to only share sensitive\u000ainformation online where there is a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) padlock in the\u000abrowser\u2019s address bar. The padlock means that a web user can be confident that\u000athe website has up-to-date SSL Certificates, is\u000aalso protected with a strong encryption, assessed for vulnerability and scanned\u000adaily for malware.

VSponsored post Like the computers and mobile phones in earlier days, the Internet of Things (IoT) is the next big hype creating expectations in the business world today.  As is known, the IoT connects devices/things with chips through transmitters, sensors, wireless networks, actuators and the Cloud, while making them traceable thus re-engineering all electronic commodities in order to make them suitable for the latest computing arena. Here is where protocols like Zigbee, CIP, Ethernet/IP and TCP/IP come in, however, the purview for 6LoWPAN-IPv6 is greater due to its capacity of large space and its ability to monitor capabilities while increasing efficiency. With standard protocols emerging for the interchanging of data among sensors and IoT having recently emerged, standard systems, networks, or interfaces haven\u2019t been agreed upon yet. Therefore more research needs to be done while development is in progress, thus making sure that all devices will be IoT enabled with great potentials in the near future. The IoT can be broadly classified into: User Experience in IoT- With Necessity is the root of innovation, it is better understood when looked at in terms of a product/device/service having appealing UX. In the IoT, UX can definitely be a value added on both for industrial and consumer domains by making it more user-friendly. Good UX helps IoT reach its full potential as it enables user-machine interaction possible.  3 main features offered by UX- Clear proposition \u2013 While UX giving a good start to IoT it is a perfect place for end users to define their problem. Good UI helps people understand the usefulness of design/product.  Clear conceptual model \u2013 With programming coming into the picture based on UI design (Visual/Graphical) of the system model, static designs can be made into dynamic ones. By acquiring a clear model people will be able to understand the product sooner, thereby gaining the market faster. Interusability \u2013 While using Service-oriented approach for UX design, implementing interusability can help aid the model synchronize across multiple functionalities, thus making it suitable for the market.  Layers of IoT \u2013 UX: By placing the problem solving approach between the user and the business models UX design are seen as having multiple faces in IoT , however, its layers may vary depending on the device/product\u2018s functionality. Thus with a diverse scope spanning food processing, agriculture, transport, utility and security in both businesses as well as for consumers, IoT is seen as a trickling brink for innovation reaching larger audiences.                                   To know more about User Experience Engineering click here.

VThe camera on the HTC One and new HTC One mini isn\u2019t just about great specs \u2014 HTC\u2019s clever software makes it easy to achieve quality photos, and to make sure your shots aren\u2019t ruined by bad timing.  If you\u2019re snapping someone\u2019s portrait, the worst thing that can happen is your photo recording them with closed eyes or a wonky grin. Take a photo on most smartphones and you\u2019re stuck with just the single frame you took \u2014 but the HTC One and new HTC One mini work differently. Always Smile is built into the HTC One and HTC One mini\u2019s photo and gallery apps. It uses the One\u2019s unique Zoe mode to capture up to 20 photos within 3 seconds. Simply select the Zoe mode, and tap the photo button once you\u2019ve got your photo lined up.  Once your Zoe photo is recorded, you can edit it by entering the gallery, selecting the Retouch option, and choosing the Always Smile feature. The app intelligently selects the face or faces within your photo, and lets you choose the best frame for each \u2014 just tap or swipe through the options captured by Zoe, and select your favourite. You can even choose different faces for each member of a group and stitch them together into your original photo.  When you\u2019re taking group photos with your camera, you want to have a clean background that doesn\u2019t distract from the people you\u2019re photographing. Zoe mode has another nifty feature that solves that conundrum: Object Removal. Object Removal works just like Always Smile \u2013 once you\u2019ve captured a Zoe photo with your One\u2019s camera, choose Object Removal from the editing menu in the gallery. Software picks out moving objects in your photos, and lets you remove them or keep them as you wish to get the best-looking photo possible. Object Removal works seamlessly to blend in the background from other frames of your Zoe photo, so you won\u2019t be left with an ugly cut-out or blurry mess \u2013 and you choose when and how to use it. With Object Removal and Always Smile, thanks to Zoe mode, your portraits and group shots will look great, and you\u2019ll never have to compromise on your favourite photo. \u000aLearn about Zoe mode on the HTC one and HTC One mini at HTC Australia\u2019s website.

V Picking a smartphone with a good camera is important. You might be snapping a picture of your friends at a party, taking an arty photo for Instagram or Flickr, or recording a quick video of an amazing sunset. You use your phone\u2019s camera all the time. That\u2019s why the UltraPixel camera inside the HTC One and HTC One mini is such a revelation. HTC\u2019s UltraPixel technology is different to other smartphone cameras. Other cameras cram megapixels by the dozen onto their imaging sensors, making each pixel incredibly tiny \u2014 and not very sensitive to light.  The UltraPixel camera on the HTC One and HTC One mini has just as large an imaging sensor as other smartphone cameras, but its large pixels \u2014 twice as large as most competitors \u2014 mean much better performance in low light, as well as capturing more detail in the darker areas of even well-lit photos. Despite this extra detail, the HTC One\u2019s photos take up less space on your phone. HTC\u2019s ImageChip 2 keeps file sizes small while maintaining excellent quality. There\u2019s room for over 30,000 photos, or three hours of Full HD video, on the 32GB HTC One. And you can automatically upload your photos to HTC Share or Dropbox to save space. The HTC One and HTC One mini have some of the biggest smartphone lens aperture on the market, with a f/2.0 lens that lets in 44 per cent more light than the f/2.4 lens of the iPhone 5 and other smartphones. This means that in equal lighting, the HTC One captures pictures quicker than its competitors, with a faster shutter speed that means less camera shake and no blurry photos. If you do find yourself in bad lighting, though, the larger HTC One\u2019s optical image stabilisation means you can capture a photo where other phones just can\u2019t. OIS makes it easier to take a clear photo in dim light, using a gyroscope to hold the lens still when you\u2019re taking a photo \u2014 even if your hands are shaky. The combination of UltraPixel sensor, super-fast lens and optical image stabilisation means the HTC One\u2019s camera is leagues ahead of its competitors for taking photos in all kinds of lighting conditions. A good smartphone camera isn\u2019t great without an app that lets it perform its best. HTC\u2019s camera app on the HTC One and HTC One mini lets you take photos, film videos and edit them all in one place. With the HTC One\u2019s camera app, there\u2019s no need to switch between photo and video modes, or to hunt through a list of settings to change between cameras. Simply swipe across the screen to switch between the rear UltraPixel and the front 2.1-megapixel camera, and tap either the photo or video button whenever you want.  If you do want to change settings, it\u2019s easy. There\u2019s a list of scene modes to choose, different photo crop styles, manual controls, and a huge range of live filters so you can see what your photo will look like before you take it.  The HTC One has an HDR mode for dramatic, super-detailed photos, a burst mode that can snap eight full photos per second, and a Sequence Shot that lets you stitch multiple action photos into one frame \u2014 everything you could need in one app.  If we had to pick a favourite, we\u2019d say the killer feature of the HTC One is Zoe.  Zoe is a 3-second photo hybrid, where about 20 photos are captured in quick succession and stitched together into a video clip. After you\u2019ve made your Zoe, you can watch it as a looping movie, share it, or scroll through and save your favourite moment as its own photo.

V\u000a Sponsored post Businesses are always looking for ways to adapt their organisations in a way that integrates new and developing technologies into their business plans.Due to the demands of fast paced and volatile markets, businesses need to be ready and prepared for any eventuality. The main means of ensuring this is through the development of a well-designed and comprehensive system that utilises the newest and most useful technologies.One such technology is IP telephony, which is now being used by a huge number of businesses as an efficient replacement for traditional communication systems.Here we take a look at exactly what IP telephony is and what it can do for you and your business. What Is IP Telephony?\u000aIP telephony is essentially a means of communicating over a network system. By converting your conversations into packets of data and transporting them across LAN or internet connections, users are able to talk in real time more efficiently than over the phone. IP telephony, also often referred to as VOIP (Voice Over IP) fulfills one need in particular, replacing the use of traditional phones and phone networks, with an internet based system. IP Telephony works as an outbound service for making calls and works in conjunction with non geos like 0845 numbers which you may already have in place to handle your incoming calls. BenefitsWhile the quality of voice communications was historically poor, in recent years these technological hurdles have been overcome and the quality of communications are now incredibly high. IP telephony proves to be a brilliantly inexpensive option for businesses, largely due to lower installation fees and reduced monthly rental charges. Now that high levels of bandwidth are no longer required to transmit voice communications, the implementation and use of IP telephony is incredibly beneficial. Though the exact savings will depend on the specific circumstances surrounding your business, savings can be made by moving away from traditional forms of communication.Businesses can also benefit from the increased mobility allowed with the use of IP telephony. Thanks to the increasing amount of smartphones and mobile devices being used, IP telephony services can be accessed from almost anywhere at any time, giving your employees a greater amount of freedom and independence. Using IP telephony also gears your business towards those technologies which may emerge in the future, ensuring that you\u2019re not left behind in the coming years. Is It Right For You?IP telephony is now considered a hugely important part of most businesses and is an integral part of business communication, through call centre staff, homeworkers and mobile workers. IP telephony is right for nearly all businesses especially those with multiple sites. When combined with easy to set up 0845 numbers, your inbound and outbound telecoms are likely to be in good shape as a business for years to come.\u000a

V var noskim = 'true';  \u000a Sponsored post The talk of the electronic world over the last year or so has been the rise of the tablet computer. Characterised by pared-down simplicity and a deft ability to display text and graphics, tablets are said to be a great option for people who want a simple-to-use e-reader, media sharing platform, or portable games machine. In addition to their entertainment capabilities, tablets are increasingly being billed as important learning tools for the future. In fact, some schools and universities are already embracing the benefits of tablet technology, with one school in Kent aiming to provide each of its pupils with the device at the start of this academic year.  For many of us, the idea of packing an iPad in a satchel may forever be a foreign concept, but for a generation of children brought up with digital technology, they could be a fine classroom complement to bring learning to life. Appy learning At the time of writing, the iPad is seen to be the most popular tablet platform, and is predicted to hold this position in the market for the next few years at least. Here we take a look at some of the learning apps available for it. In addition to a range of apps for young children designed to stimulate language and numeracy abilities through games \u2013 for example ABC Animals, or Math Bingo \u2013 there are also more specialised experiences for older learners.  Science: Chemists may well enjoy the popular The Elements: A Visual Exploration \u2013 which is said to bring the periodic table to life \u2013 while Pocket Heart aims to get under the skin of biology students, showing the workings of the organ. Other apps focus on bringing the universe to life, while if you need more in-depth research, there are e-readers for new articles published by scientific journals.  Literature: One of the main benefits of the tablet is said to be its ability to bring to life things that may usually be considered inaccessible. The Waste Land app is an example of this, with various readings of the famous TS Eliot poem \u2013 supported by notes, video commentaries and pictures. Similarly, Shakespeare in Bits: Romeo and Juliet is an interactive study guide which breaks the play down into digestible sections, and includes in depth character biographies and a translation feature which helps explain some of the more obscure words and phrases. There is also an animation of the play voiced by household names such as Michael Sheen and Kate Beckinsale. History and geography: Another feature of the device is its ability to recreate a world more explicitly than a book can, an example being Virtual History \u2013 Roma, which recreates the capital of the Roman World, promising a \u201c\u2018full immersion\u2019 panoramic experience\u201d. Meanwhile, History: Maps of the World helps provide a context to historical events with high-resolution maps from back in the day. A tablet computer \u2013 whether an iPad or a Google Android-based device \u2013 could be a useful learning tool for your child, and could possibly help to broaden their learning experience. But with tablets typically costing from £400, it could be a good idea to do plenty of research in advance before deciding to buy, making sure you get the best price and package for you or your child\u2019s needs. A convenient way to pay could be by credit card, especially if you\u2019ve got a credit card that offers a 0% period on purchases or rewards your spending.

VYou know how to test out Azure\u2019s cloud capabilities and how it can help your career. But how can you ensure your cloud apps reach their full potential? Here are some useful best-practice guidelines.\u000a Developing an app to run either locally on a machine or within the LAN is pretty well understood \u2014 after all it\u2019s been the dominant application development and deployment model of the last 25 years. But the cloud changes the rules. Should we take advantage of local processing capability or offload everything to a remote server and just use the computer as a presentation layer? What are the best tools? Are there specific methodologies that work best? Those of us with a few grey hairs might recall the Waterfall and Spiralmodels of application development. However, today the buzzword is agile. In the old days, there were long phases of planning and testing before new application versions were released. Today, new features are developed, tested and deployed in days rather than months. However, that rapid turnaround time isn\u2019t an excuse to deploy slipshod work. The rules of best practice still apply. Delivering functional applications depends on where you\u2019re coming from. If you\u2019re developing an entirely new application for your business then it\u2019s likely that the application requirements will be tied down and you\u2019re looking at an application port to the cloud. To help you along the way there\u2019s Moving Applications to the Cloud on the Microsoft Windows Azure Platform published by Microsoft Press. That will guide through the basics through to using storage, automating deployment and application tuning. As a starting point, Microsoft employee Simon J Ince has produced a handy checklist to assist with the planning process for migrating applications to Azure. One of the great advantages of Azure over running everything in your own data centre is that Azure makes it it easy to add storage and processing capacity quickly. With your own data centre, the procurement and deployment cycle is far longer that Azure\u2019s point and click model of expansion. However, with that capacity to easily beef up your architecture, there\u2019s a need to ensure that applications are able to use the expanded system capability. Fortunately, Microsoft is working to simplify application scaling for developers through the cleverly-named WASABi \u2013 the Windows Azure Auto-Scaling Application Block. It\u2019s now a beta release and it allows developers and IT professionals to add and manage automatic scaling capabilities for Windows Azure hosted apps and services. Sample code is like gold to developers. Rather than having to start with a blank slate, you can leverage the work of others to get you going.  A great place to start is the open-source community CodePlex. There you\u2019ll find the Windows Azure SDK for PHP to support deploying PHP apps to Windows Azure. Microsoft also provides samples as part of their online learning service. Those Azure code samples cover a variety of platform technologies and programming languages.

V Not all running shoes are created equal, and over the years the tech making sure your feet are comfortable while they pound the pavement has advanced significantly. Manufacturers have certainly been working on it long enough, as evidenced by this wonderfully old school Discovery Channel special with hilarious egg-dropping experiment sequences (check out the computer monitors for an indication of how ancient this is!). But what exactly is going on inside our shoes these days?  We got the lowdown on two technologies you\u2019d probably never paid any attention to, that have been keeping your feet protected this whole time, from The Athlete\u2019s Foot. These guys know that people run for all different reasons and motivations, and that everyone\u2019s fit is different, unique and special. Here\u2019s just two features that may end up in your next pair of runners. The ASICS GEL Cushioning System has been the core technology of ASICS\u2019 footwear for nearly two decades. Placed within the shoe\u2019s midsole at key impact areas, the GEL Cushioning System works in conjunction with the midsole material to attenuate the shock experienced by the foot from vertical forces in all sporting activities. ASICS footwear meets the particular biomechanical needs of athletes. The GEL Cushioning System is a key component in meeting these needs and is developed in many densities and shapes to best fit the impact requirements of these athletes.  Rearfoot GEL\u000aDuring a standard run, the foot encounters vertical impact forces normally 3 to 5 times an athlete\u2019s body weight during heelstrike. The GEL Cushioning System in the heel attenuates the shock from this. The Rearfoot GEL Cushioning System stabilises the foot during the first phase of the Impact Guidance System (I.G.S.). Forefoot GEL\u000aThe GEL Cushioning System in the forefoot reduces the loading forces that would normally be applied as the foot moves in propulsion. The Forefoot GEL Cushioning System works in conjunction with the midsole material to reduce the shear forces and the forefoot flex grooves to accommodate the pressure as the foot rolls through the \u201cline of progression\u201d to toe-off, the final phase of the I.G.S. Rearfoot GEL and Forefoot GEL often are found together in a shoe because of their separate functions within a shoe\u2019s construction. ASICS GEL-Kayano 21  ISOFIT is the new upper technology that Saucony have pioneered with the Triumph 12. ISOFIT creates a dynamic fit (sock-like feel) and adapts to the shape of the runner\u2019s foot. The open toe box design further enhances a plush feel and delivers superior comfort. A soft inner sleeve and floating support cage combine to create a dynamic fit system that adapts to the shape and motion of your foot \u2014 it basically morphs to the foot for a sock-like feel. See it in action here:  No matter if you\u2019re a tech runner, an office runner, or even an athlete \u2014 if you\u2019re in pain when you exercise, you shouldn\u2019t be. With expert advice from The Athlete\u2019s Foot you can find the perfect fit, and LOVE THE RUN®.

VWindows Azure represents a radical and efficient new way to develop and deploy applications for business, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s hard to get started. Here\u2019s what you need to do to set it up, plus your chance to have questions about Azure answered directly by Microsoft.  Talk to the current generation of IT managers and execs and you\u2019ll hear the same thing \u2014 the cloud represents as big a shift in technology use and management as the PC did in the 80s and the Internet in the 90s and 00s. While Microsoft was at the forefront of the PC revolution in the 80s, it required a significant course correction with the Internet. There was no chance that Microsoft was going to be caught napping at the cloud revolution and so Azure was born. Azure is Microsoft\u2019s online server, software and developer platform. It\u2019s important to recognise that Azure isn\u2019t a product per se. It\u2019s an online platform for building, hosting and scaling applications to meet a business\u2019s needs. Although Microsoft has its own Azure product information, Lifehacker\u2019s guide to Windows Azure 101 is a great primer to learn the basics. But how can you get hands-on experience? Microsoft offers a try-before-you-buy option with Azure. This is a free 90-day trial that lets you get your head around the capability of Azure without having to outlay lots of money up-front. However, the 90-day does have some limits. It offers 750 hours of a Small Compute Instance. A Compute Instance is a virtual server. A Small Compute Instance is a virtual server with a 1.6GHz processor, 1.75GB of memory and 220GB of storage. If you\u2019re interested in seeing what options Microsoft has for Compute Instances, there\u2019s a list of the relevant specs at the Azure Compute site. The trial includes 1GB of database storage, 20GB of outbound data, unlimited inbound data and up to 100,000 transactions. Getting into the trial is straightforward. Go to the Azure Free Trial site and log in with a Live account. The fill in your name, address and other contact information and follow the prompts. At the end, you\u2019ll have an Azure account ready for your testing pleasure. It might seem like a pain but you\u2019ll need to provide some credit card information in order to sign up for the Azure 90-day trial. There\u2019s a simple reason for this \u2014 if you exceed the usage limits of the trial, you\u2019ll need to stump up for them. The charges are clearly laid out at the Azure special rates site. Microsoft provides lots of tools for getting started with Azure. The first port of call are the Windows Azure Tools for Visual Studio. So that you\u2019re not left holding the tools with no clue as to what to do next, there are also code samples, tutorials, technical articles and a vigourous online forum for asking questions and sharing what you\u2019ve learned. All of that is available from the Azure Developer Services site, and there are additional resources you can access as well.

The problem: Detecting childhood Pneumonia in developing nations\u000aTeam StethoCloud: Hon Wen Chong, Andrew Lin, Kim Ramchen, Masha Salehi\u000a(University of Melbourne) Pneumonia has been labelled as the \u201cforgotten killer of children\u201d due to the lack of attention and exposure in developing nations. This project aims to provide an innovative solution to detect pneumonia ealry. By connecting a stethoscope to a Windows Phone 7 smart phone \u2013 a community health worker or unskilled administrator is able to transit diagnostic information into a cloud service that analyses a patients breathing sounds for patterns that represent the earliest stages of pneumonia.  Stethocloud reproduces the diagnostic capability of a trained medical doctor and is able to detect, alert, and advise those with little or no awareness of pneumatic or respiratory illness as to the seriousness of a child\u2019s condition and force intervention much earlier, and in effect, save millions of lives a year The problem: Improving childhood learning engagement during key developmental years\u000aTeam Awesome: Vu Pham, Monish Parajuli, Stuart Anderson, Anh Pham The Kinect device is now being used in new and exciting contexts. Inspired by this, \u201cKinect Academy\u201d aims to fill the gap with an educational application for children aged four to ten years (a critical childhood development period) which is filled with activities. A NUI interface allow s users to answer sets of quiz questions covering any topic imaginable, with the aim that using body movement and voice commands will be more engaging than traditional learning methods.  The problem: Challenges of food distribution in developing nations\u000aTeam Confufish: Brad Lorge, Aimee Lowth\u000a(University of NSW) Team Confufish has created a flexible and open distribution and logistics system that is simple and cheap enough to be deployed in developing countries. The Project is a distribution and logistics system that uses Windows Phone 7 and Windows Azure to improve food distribution. To minimise costs, Confufish will use schools as food distribution centres, creating a sense of community and facilitating a \u2018Food for Learning\u2019 program that helps children attend school feeling healthy and well fed. The system plans optimal travel paths for deliveries based on variables including topology, seasonal restrictions natural disaster alerts and conflict zones. Confufish aims to integrate with existing transport companies, with all delivery vehicles tracked via GPS to maximize delivery efficiency, accountability and driver safety.  The problem: Preventing food wastage\u000aTeam Food4Thought: Xharmagne Carandang, Paul Du\u000a(University of Canberra) Food 4 Thought tackles food waste by attempting to change critical behaviors that normally result in food wastage \u2013 a major issue contributing to global poverty and hunger.

VGreat news for busy Australian small offices \u2014 or if find yourself working from home regularly. It now only takes a small investment of just a couple of hundred dollars to ensure you benefit from the latest print, copy, scan and fast fax technology. Here\u2019s what you need to look for. Multifunction printers \u2014 those with the ability to print, copy, scan and fax \u2014 have become so popular because they\u2019re more versatile and space-saving than finding room for a bunch of individual machines. Compared to laser models, inkjet all-in-ones generally cost less to buy up-front and tend to produce superior colour prints. Though lasers are well regarded for their low cost-per-page running cost, new multifunction printers like Brother\u2019s flagship $299 MFC-J5720DW (pictured) turn the market on its head. With super high yield ink cartridges, the MFC-J5720DW produces black and white prints at an incredible 2.3 cents per page (LC-239XL BK ink: 2400 pages using ISO/IEC 24711 test standards). Perfect for small business. From legal, marketing and accounting firms to retail and real estate offices.  Of course, a low-printing cost means nothing if you\u2019re forever lining up to grab your print-out. Inkjet or laser, you should demand at least 18 pages per minute (ppm) output for your workplace. The same Brother MFC-J5720DW has laser-like speeds of up to 22/20ppm monochrome/colour. Having to constantly place new paper in your printer is frustrating and a waste of time. Carefully consider your device\u2019s capacity and look for advanced paper handling: two sided printing, automatic document feeding (ADF) and more. The MFC-J5720DW has time-saving functions such as automatic 2-sided scanning / up to A4, and an up to 50-sheet automatic document feeder. It also introduces a multi-purpose tray that handles up to 80 sheets in A4, or 5 sheets in A3. Dual trays offer 500-sheet capacity for paper up to A3 size and switch easily between printing envelopes, labels and paper of varied thickness. Removing hassle means getting more done.  In addition to an old-school Ethernet connection, you definitely want your new multifunction printer to include Wi-Fi for wireless printing from laptops, etc. The Brother MFC-J5720DW can print from Apple, Android and Windows smartphones or tablets (via AirPrint/Wi-Fi Direct/Brother\u2019s iPrint&Scan app) and has built-in slots for printing from or scanning to USB drives and media cards.  A multifunction printer with direct connection to cloud services and mobile devices offers easy collaboration both in and away from the office. Simply put, the Brother MFC-J5720DW can print documents directly from popular online storage services such as Google Docs/Drive, DropBox, OneDrive, Evernote, Box, OneNote, Facebook and Flickr. You can also scan documents and photos directly to these same services.  With an easy-to-use 9.3cm touchscreen LCD, innovative landscape printing technology for an unobtrusive space-saving design and 2-year limited warranty with free phone support for its lifetime, the surprising $299 MFC-J5720DW sets the benchmark to compare any new small office/home office multifunction inkjet against.

V Sometimes it\u2019s hard to let go of a great game\u2026particularly if it\u2019s a killer title like Mass Effect. But there are times when you just need the cash, right?  More at Game TV\u2019s YouTube channel and game.com.au. Final Fantasy XIII Collector's Edition. Because it's shit. I've never traded a game. Still got the NES games, SNES, N64, PS2, PS3 and 360 games. Although I think current games will have less replay value in 10 -20 years than the NES and SNES classics.

V Did you see it? The popular ABC gaming show was interrupted by some dude who made this strange statement: \u201cI think I\u2019m party to a crime in progress and it will affect us all if it goes ahead, so let me explain my dilemma. I\u2019ve been working for privately funded laboratories specifically researching geoengineering solutions. What\u2019s geoengineering\u2026\u201d What the hell does that mean?  Who was he? Who has he been working for? And what are they up to? Well, we\u2019ve done some sniffing around, and we reckon it\u2019s this guy. His name is Kyle Vandercamp. But what was he on about?  We\u2019re not quite sure ourselves at this stage, but it looks like a campaign of some sort. We\u2019re checking out his blog and also this blog now. Stay tuned, we\u2019ll keep you updated.

VThe end of financial year is great time to buy new tech gear. If you use your computer at home for work \u2014 you may be able to claim your PC as a tax deduction. That applies to some students, too. Further, small businesses with total incomes less than $2 million can write off purchases valued under $6500 immediately in the year the cost occurred. So what new laptops/tablets are best for work or play? Here are some ideas.  For further information on deductions, click on the Australian Tax Office links above. ASUS encourages all individuals and businesses to visit your tax professional for advice tailored to your specific situation. If productivity matters most, the ASUS Zenbook UX301/302 delivers high performance in a stylish, lightweight design. Premium specs include an Intel Core i7 processor, Windows 8, solid state hard disks and a 13.3-inch multi-touch screen protected with Corning Gorilla Glass. The higher spec Zenbooks are available from sSpecialist Australian retailers such as CentreCom, BCC Computers and Sorptec. In general, you should be wary of\u000abuying laptops from overseas vendors or grey importers as the warranty may not be valid.   The top-selling ASUS Transformer Book T100 is an ideal choice. The 2-in-1 ultraportable has a 10.1-inch multi-touch display that can detach from the keyboard \u2014 you get the productivity of a laptop and the convenience of a tablet.  The T100 packs a speed Intel quad-core processor and up to 11 hours battery life. Perfect for running around university campuses. At just $599, the ASUS Transformer Book T100 is cheaper than an iPad, more versatile, and includes Microsoft Office Home and Student.   Looking out for deals around tax time is important. The T100 can be bought through all the big retailers, so it\u2019s worth shopping around the likes of\u000aJB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman and Dick Smith for best prices.    \u000aTransform your computing life. .\u000a I know this is an advertisement but I have a tax related question. I have a Surface Pro that I have used for minor work purposes (Checking email, meeting note taking, video conversion for work colleagues presentation and making my own presentation) If I had to split it up in a percentage, I'd say it's no more than 15%-20% work related. How do I go about claiming this on my tax? I have only had a very simple tax return in the past (PAYG statements, that's it) As it's purchase price is over $300, you would need to depreciate it at 3 years/ 66.66% (life of a laptop per ATO) under D5. Definitely Google depreciation on the ATO though! Also issue with the article, the $6,500.00 instant write-off was reduced back to $1,000.00 in the budget. Does the budget effect this years returns or only start with next years? The item was only around $700 at the time. I'd just like to get the most back, so even if I can only claim $50-$100 I'd be happy If you use etax, it works it all out automatically for you... I've got two computers and a DSLR that are automatically populated when I first load up etax, with relevant depreciation values already calculated.  IIRC it even allows you to add a work-related usage percentage when entering the product details. Ahh great! Thank you Remember that if you bought the laptop/tablet partway through the year you can only claim depreciation for that part of the year after you bought it. So for a $700 laptop bought on December 31st, you would only claim half of the amount otherwise depreciated. Using the Prime cost method (flat claim per year), assuming a 3 year lifetime, you would claim $700x0.2x0.5/3 or $23.33 for your first year, $46.67 ($700x0.2x1.0/3) for the second and third years, and $23.33 (the residue) in the fourth year. Also make sure you keep proof of percentage of work proof, ATO are targeting phone and computer work related use this year. This is what I'm worried about, I have my receipt of purchase. But how do I prove my "work time"? Really you'll just most likely have to explain why you need to use it for work, that would stump plenty of people who would have no work to do at home and just claim it anyway. Yeah fair enough. The surface was not suppose to be for work related stuff, but since I never got a laptop and I can work anywhere From Brisbane to Noosa. I have had to make use of my own gear. And if that make it tax deductible then I will want to claim it. Really if you're not sure, go to an accountant. It only costs the first year as ever year after that you claim the previous as a tax deduction. Don't EVER take advice from the ATO hotline, the one time I did that, I was audited and screwed on the exact advice they gave me. To quote the ATO web site: "You must apportion the amount of your claim if the computer, laptop or internet has been used in part for private purposes. You need to keep a diary to record the amount of time you use your home computer and internet for work and private purposes. The diary must include a representative period of at least four weeks to establish a pattern of use for the whole year." Reference: https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Income-and-deductions/In-detail/Deductions-for-specific-industries-and-occupations/IT-professionals---claiming-work-related-expenses/?page=21 BTW remember that if you do any work from home some of your electricity bill can also be claimed, but it may not be enough to bother calculating. If you work from home for 2 hours/week then you can expense 2/168 part of your electricity bill (as far as I know). \u000a									Last edited June 16, 2014 11:33 pm								 JB is selling the Asus T100 for $448 tomorrow only. http://www.jbhifi.com.au/tax-time-madness/?utm_medium=Email&utm_source=ExactTarget&utm_campaign=JB-AU-20140616-Tax-Time-Madness

VWhen you buy a phone, you want it to last. You don\u2019t want it to get scratched or scuffed easily, and you don\u2019t want it to break if (and when) you drop it. Thanks to its full metal body, machined from a single piece of aluminium, the HTC One and new HTC One mini will outlast and outperform its competitors where it matters.  Because they\u2019re built from a single piece of aluminium, the HTC One / HTC One mini feel solid and sturdy in your hand \u2014 there\u2019s no creaking or flexing when you\u2019re holding it, and every physical button has a satisfying, solid click. The anodized aluminium in a stealthy black or stylish silver is scratch- and fingerprint-resistant, so your new phone will stay looking new for a long time. A row of tiny holes on the top and bottom front face of either phone hide HTC BoomSound stereo speakers, keeping out dust while still letting rich and full sound through. Even the microUSB cable fits perfectly in the machine-cut port at the bottom of the phone \u2014 the precision in HTC\u2019s construction is impressive.  The HTC One and HTC One mini\u2019s UltraPixel camera and large f/2.0 aperture lens are integrated into the design \u2014 there\u2019s no unsightly bulge or hump on the camera\u2019s rear. The smooth, curved shell also means each sits easily in your hand, while the embossed HTC logo adds a touch of class to an already stylish design. There\u2019s just enough bezel on the edges, top and bottom to let you grip easily, without adding unnecessary bulk or weight. The HTC One and HTC One mini are designed to be deceptively simple and sturdy. Almost elegant. \u000aSee what a difference the HTC One and HTC One mini\u2019s full metal body and design makes at\u000aHTC Australia\u2019s website.\u000a

You can get it by simply scheduling you bill payments with BPAY®, and we can show you how.  Your insurance premiums fluctuate very occasionally (if you\u2019re lucky!), making it perfect to schedule. If it does go up, simply jump in and update it. Too easy! Missing a rental payment has probably one of the biggest consequences of any bill you may have. Having it sorted to be automatically paid every month1will keep your track record with your landlord in the best possible shape.

You won\u2019t miss it and it\u2019ll protect you against major bill blow outs when you\u2019ve been cranking the air con or heater. You know what sucks? Getting to the pointy end of the month and realising there was a bill you probably should have taken care of weeks ago. Organise a payment to be scheduled the day after your pay hits so you feel it less.

VNo matter what business you\u2019re in, the cost of running an office hurts. Ongoing costs like stationary, paper and electricity may not raise eyebrows day-to-day, but in the long run will detract significantly from the bottom line. And that\u2019s not even counting your time. That\u2019s why it pays to implement the right technology. Smart lights and thermometers can cut down on your electric bill.  The right computers or printer can reduce the time you spend fiddling with paper, dealing with breakdowns \u2014 and picking up more supplies. More efficient technologies often cost more up-front than their less efficient counterparts. But the differences over the life of the product can be considerable. As we\u2019ve written about before a 60 watt LED bulb can cost up to seven times more than a traditional bulb, but can last up to five times longer and cost less per hour to run. A laptop, with its smaller screen can use half the wattage of much bigger desktop computers.  This premise extends across devices. The Epson Workforce Pro WF-R8590TC, for example, uses up to 80 per cent less power less power than a laster printer because it doesn\u2019t produce heat. No heat means no cooling, which equals lower power consumption. Ignoring up-front costs only works if you are very selective with what you buy. You have to consider all of the running costs, and whether the gadget will always be fit for purpose.  If you are choosing a printer, look for something that reliably does it all: print, scan, copy and fax. Look for something like the Epson Workforce Pro, that is built for business, with built-in Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and a Replaceable Ink Pack System (RIPS) that delivers 75,000 printed pages before changing ink packs. Remember, wasted time is also a cost. With the Workforce Pro you\u2019ll be able to get more done thanks to print speeds up to 34ppm (monochrome) and 30ppm in colour, plus a massive 1,831 sheet paper capacity. That means less time-wasting interruptions and fiddling around.  Epson RIPS machines also come with PaperCut print manager software tools to help you monitor and evaluate your office printers, allowing you to avoid wasteful printing.  The right technology will empower your business. It will save you time. And boost productivity.

VSponsored post With commercial database growing at unprecedented rates, data mining is the new buzzword in the business world. It is a powerful mechanism that helps to automatically evaluate huge data to discover patterns and trends that helps the companies to focus on the most important information in their database and make proactive informed decisions.  It saves time and also predicts unexpected facts that help the businesses to explore newer ways to generate more revenue. The key properties of this technology include automatic discovery of patterns, prediction of likely outcomes, creation of useful information and focus on large data sets and databases. This easy to implement solution is instrumental in predicting trends and behaviors that helps in target marketing to identify the most potential promotional strategies and even forecast future predicaments like bankruptcy. It also helps to trace unnoticed patterns for example evaluating retail sales to find out products that are purchased together. Data mining uses a technique called modeling to predict these trends where in a model is developed in one situation where the outcome is known and then putting the same model into another situation to predict the outcome of that situation. The software scans all the data in the computers and extracts characteristics of the data that should go into the model. Once the model is built, it can be applied to similar situations to predict the outcome. Data mining also identifies natural grouping with in the data. The companies require fully integrated data warehouse as well as flexible interactive business analysis tools. The process starts with data warehouse that contains information about the entire customer base as well as market updates about the competitors. On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a tool that used for analyzing shared multidimensional data such as cost allocation, data summarization, time series analysis, what-if analysis and full support for hierarchies. The difference with data mining lies in the fact that data mining does not have the concept of dimensions and hierarchies. Data mining software should be integrated with data warehouse and OLAP to bring out ROI-focused business analysis. Through the process of integration with the data warehouse, operational decisions can be directly implemented and tracked. As the warehouse grows with new decisions and results, the organization can continually mine the best practices and apply them to future decisions. There is an explosion of information pertaining to customer, supplier and market information. The need of the hour is timely and sophisticated analysis of this unfathomable bulk of information. There is a gap between the data storage, retrieval systems and the users\u2019 ability to analyze and act on the information. Data mining tools have proven to be useful to businesses by bridging this gap and opening up new ways to get the sales figure shoot higher. To know more about data mining click here.

VPlanning a date? You probably shouldn\u2019t choose one of these conversation starters. Love them or hate them, they are the films that have thrilled, shocked and divided audiences \u2014 and now thanks to Stan you can stream them anytime, anywhere you have internet access.  Line up the most uncomfortable movie marathon. Ever. Here are ten of the ultimate controversial films on  Stan, and why they got audiences talking \u2014 or walking out of the cinema. NSFW, depending on how interesting your workplace is.  2006\u000aA group of New Yorkers caught up in their romantic-sexual milieu converge at an underground salon infamous for its blend of art, music, politics, and carnality. The actors actually have sex in this film. Proper, full on, not acting but actually having real sex, sex. Maybe don\u2019t watch this with your parents in the room.   2013\u000aA documentary on BDSM fetish porn website Kink.com. Produced by James Franco (yes, the James Franco), Kink is an exploration of the lives of people who work in BDSM porn. Save this one for the third date, at least.   2004\u000aLove blooms between an American college student and a British glaciologist, where over the next few months in between attending rock concerts, the two lovers have intense sexual encounters. Okay, this is pretty much as close to porn as you can get without it being hosted on PornHub. The soundtrack is awesome, with Franz Ferdinand, Primal Scream and Black Rebel Motorcycle club.   1972\u000aA woman with an unusual birth defect (her clitoris is in her throat) comes to a doctor who has an unorthodox solution (use your imagination) to make the best of her situation. Deep Throat reportedly earned as much as $600 million, a figure that may have been inflated by gangsters in money laundering schemes.  2013\u000aA self-diagnosed nymphomaniac recounts her erotic experiences to the man who saved her after a beating. This is that movie that Shia LaBeouf was asked to send dick pics to score a role in, and he responded with graphic sex tapes of him and his girlfriend doing the deed. He got the gig.   2002 \u000aEvents over the course of one traumatic night in Paris unfold in reverse-chronological order as the beautiful Alex is brutally raped and beaten by a stranger in the underpass. Of the 2,400 people at the film\u2019s Cannes premiere, 200 walked out. Enough said.  2009\u000aA grieving couple retreat to their cabin in the woods, hoping to repair their broken hearts and troubled marriage. But nature takes its course and things go from bad to worse. Surprisingly, a video game based on the film was originally in development before the company behind the game went out of business.  2000\u000aIn the future, the Japanese government captures a class of ninth-grade students and forces them to kill each other under the revolutionary \u201cBattle Royale\u201d act. This is the film that The Hunger Games will forever be compared to, albeit a much, much more graphic version. It is Quentin Tarantino\u2019s favourite movie, after all.  2000\u000aTwo young women, marginalised by society, go on a destructive tour of sex and violence. Breaking norms and killing men \u2013 and shattering the complacency of polite cinema audiences. Heavy on the sex, violence and sexual violence, Baise Moi was the first filmed to be banned in France in 28 years. It\u2019s been banned twice in Australia. And the lighting is terrible.   2010\u000aA writer who is brutalized during her cabin retreat seeks revenge on her attackers, who left her for dead. A remake of the controversial 1978 film,  both versions received zero stars from film critic Roger Ebert.

Here\u2019s our pick of the top quirky destinations and travel hacks to have you exploring New Zealand like you\u2019ve been there a thousand times \u2014 even if it\u2019s your first time. Travel Tips with Lifehacker is presented in partnership with Visa, the easier and more secure way to take your money overseas. With Visa you can behave like a traveller, #notatourist.  There are the usual suspects when it comes to travel destinations (anywhere you can ski or snowboard or bungee jump or skydive), and then there are these quirky spots you really should be adding to your itinerary. Hey so you know how New Zealand has hills and mountains? The town planners for Dunedin, from their town planning room in London, didn\u2019t. The resulting Guinness World Record Holding Baldwin Street takes full advantage of its status, having locals run up it for charity events and roll Jaffas down it for fun.  To get the true local experience, either sit on the footpath and cheer people on the way up, or jump on a drift bike and make yourself a viral YouTube video.   Mawardi Bahar / Shutterstock.com\u000aFor most of us now, New Zealand is a place that existed only before it was Middle Earth. Now the whole country is pretty much a realisation of Tolkien\u2019s universe, just with a few less Orcs. So it will come as no surprise you can visit \u201cThe Shire\u201d in the form of Hobbiton, which is one of the sets from Peter Jackson\u2019s Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film adaptations.  The tourist way is to catch the shuttle bus, but to see it like a local grab your GPS and go for a road trip.\u000a Castle Hill / Shutterstock.com\u000aThe Dalai Lama named this ruined castle shaped quarry the \u201cSpiritual Centre of the Universe\u201d. Locals use the area for climbing and \u201cbouldering\u201d which isn\u2019t as violent as it sounds. In true tradition of New Zealand being basically a giant fantasy film set, Castle Hill is also the location for battle scenes from Narnia.  Do as the locals do, and climb the rocks. There\u2019s plenty of livestock keep you company, since the whole place is on a sheep station.\u000a Okay, so this isn\u2019t indicative of all of New Zealand\u2019s public toilets. They are definitely something special. Designed by artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser, this project was his swan song before passing away in 2000. Recycled tiles and bottles adorn the walls, while a tree grows through the centre of the building. There\u2019s even grass on the roof. It\u2019s a rare insight into what daily life for Keith Richards must be like \u2014 and well worth a stop on your way to The Shire or Narnia.   There are some stunning hot springs in New Zealand. This one is a little different. Because it is filled with sulphur and looks like the result of an accident involving Springfield\u2019s nuclear power plant and resulting in a three eyed fish called Blinky. Do as the locals do and don\u2019t swim in it. It smells pretty bad.\u000a You know where to go, now here\u2019s how to not stand out as a wide eyed tourist.\u000a\u000a1. Know Your Rugby Players\u000a\u000aFollow these steps, and you\u2019ll be able to bluff your way through any footy conversations.\u000a1. Learn these names: Dan Carter, Richie McCaw, Sonny Bill.\u000a2. Drop them into conversation.\u000a3. Relax with a pint of Speights.\u000a\u000a2. Track Down Free WiFi\u000a\u000aThe best places to get online and share your top pics from your trip? McDonalds, and public libraries.\u000a\u000a3. Hide Your Glee At The Exchange Rate\u000a\u000aYou\u2019ll get a pretty sweet deal for your Aussie dollars across the pond these days. Don\u2019t rub it in.\u000a\u000a4. Learn The Lingo\u000a\u000aThose aren\u2019t your thongs, they are your jandals. You\u2019re grabbing a beer from the chilly bin, not an esky. And this whole country is pretty mint. Got it? Sweet as.\u000a\u000a5. Travel With A Toilet  \u000a\u000aSeriously. If you\u2019re road tripping around New Zealand in a campervan with a toilet on board, you can park for free on most public land. They call it \u201cFreedom Camping\u201d, and it\u2019s a great idea to avoid those super-touristy toilet stops every few hours.

p362
VBuilding for Windows Azure gives a wide choice of programming languages, from PHP to Java to Ruby to .Net. We chatted with Tim Buntel, Microsoft\u2019s Windows Azure Platform Product Manager, about how Windows Azure fits into the overall development scene. Why is Microsoft so committed to offering Windows Azure to people who haven\u2019t chosen to use a Microsoft development environment?\u000aTIM BUNTEL: Let\u2019s roll the calendar back a decade or so. In the beginning web application days, your choice of hosting operating system was somewhat separate from your choice of application server or programming language. You could run PHP, Java, ASP classic or whatever and you could choose to run it on a range of different platforms. An awful lot of people were hosting web apps on Windows even if they weren\u2019t Microsoft developers. For instance, Cold Fusion ran on Windows Server even though the programming environment was very different. Now, if you think about the Azure platform as an operating system in the cloud, then you still want to bring that same flexibility of implementation \u2014 you\u2019re just running it in the cloud instead. If you\u2019re a PHP developer, you could choose to run PHP inside the firewall or up inside the cloud. What\u2019s happening if you make the cloud choice is you\u2019re getting the benefits of the Azure platforms \u2014 the elasticity of the cloud, and the availability and reliability that comes as being part of MS\u2019 global data infrastructure. But you still have the opportunity to develop with the languages and tools you want to use locally. Use Visual Studio, use Eclipse, use anything that suits. Does that logic apply to other technologies as well?\u000aTB: Very much so in the case of SQL developers. SQL Azure is really valuable for a lot of people coming from other development approaches, because SQL Server is so common.  There are heaps of businesses writing Java apps using SQL Server, and SQL Azure is SQL Server \u2014 you use the exact same approach and the exact same tools to manage those databases. A lot of people who are more experienced with working with traditional relational database systems have been somewhat nervous about moving to the cloud and being forced to go with a noSQL approach. There haven\u2019t been a lot of really good options for people who want to stick to a traditional relational database, but with Azure  its  right there. What features does Microsoft offer to help users of non-Microsoft languages take advantage of Windows Azure?\u000aTB: For some of these specific languages \u2014 and PHP is a particularly great example \u2014 you can absolutely just use PHP the way you have previously. We do have some projects that allow you to use PHP and take advantage of some of the special benefits you can get in the cloud, such as Azure\u2019s table storage. We provide a PHP SDK that will give you a really simple PHP native library for interacting with some of those specific features. Just as you would when working with Microsoft\u2019s languages, you\u2019ll discover that the languages are the same but some of the techniques used will be different. How much effort does it take to adapt to the new platform?\u000aTB: I think it\u2019s pretty minimal. Take storage for example. You\u2019ve got blob storage as an option, and there\u2019s no concept of that if I\u2019m writing a PHP app locally. I need to understand  what are these new containers I want to use. I have to learn a couple of functions to read and write to those different storage containers, but that\u2019s really it. Once you\u2019ve retrieved something from an Azure cloud, you\u2019re still going to operate programmatically. Some things are going to be different \u2014 things like how you want to handle user authentication. Maybe you want to run the application in the cloud but base the authentication of users on a local LDAP server or Active Directory or other third-party services. That\u2019s also possible. The combinations vary. A good analogy for me has been imagine web developers going from a single server to deploying in a clustered environment. The basics are the same in how they implement the application, but you do have to take some new elements into consideration when you consider how to architect it. It\u2019s very similar to that. And Azure as a platform adds a lot of services that make that task easier. Compared to some other PaaS offerings out there, it does a really nice job of bridging those gaps. What resources are available for developers coming from a non-.NET development background?\u000aTB: MSDN is clearly the best place to start. Traditionally that has been about Microsoft technologies, but in the Azure context we have a lot of other language content there. The big one for PHP is the PHP Azure SDK which we have up on Codeplex. And since it\u2019s an open source project, developers should feel free to get involved and contribute to that library. There\u2019s also a great starter kit for Java.

V  Let\u2019s face it, understanding how much gas and electricity you are using \u2013 and most importantly how much it is all costing you \u2013 isn\u2019t an easy process. Usually you have to climb up on a ladder or go down into the cellar to find the latest meter readings, submit them to your energy company, only to get a nasty shock when you get a bill for hundreds of pounds a few days later. \u000aThankfully the days of having to read your own meter are nearing an end. The Government has signalled its intention for all homes to have smart meters installed by 2019 and some energy companies, like British Gas, are getting ahead of the game and installing them in people\u2019s homes right now. Billed as the biggest infrastructure programme since the 1970s when we switched from coal to natural gas as our main fuel, smart meters will fundamentally change the relationship we have with our energy provider by putting us in control of our usage. \u000aAs part its vision for a Smart Energy Future, British Gas commissioned Oxford Economics to investigate the value of smart metering to Britain. It found that, while the national roll out will cost £11.5 billion, the benefits of smart meters could total £25.3 billion \u2013 a gain for the country of nearly £14 billion. For more information, see the infographic (right)  for a visual summary of the money that could be saved by switching from analogue to smart meters. \u000aAs with a conventional meter, there is no upfront cost for the user. You simply pay for the meters (one for gas and one for electricity) through your energy bills, just as you do right now. However, the key is that smart meters allow you to monitor usage in real time much more effectively via a handheld device known as a smart energy monitor.  With a smart energy monitor you can see how much energy you are using at any given moment in time \u2013 even how much it costs you to boil a kettle if you so wish! \u000aYou can also set daily, weekly or monthly budgets depending on the kind of user you are and receive \u2018traffic light\u2019 based information to help you plan your usage \u2013 ie. red lights show if you are exceeding your limits, amber if you are close to the limit and green if you are below the limit. It\u2019s even possible to bring up the actual meter readings on the smart energy monitor\u2019s display to save you ever having to visit the meter in the cellar or that cupboard at the top of the stairs. Importanly smart meter readings are sent back wirelssly to British Gas which means no more estimated bills. You\u2019re only paying for the electricity and gas you use, making it easier to budget. \u000aSo how do you get a smart meter? When your home is ready for an upgrade, British Gas will contact you and their highly trained Smart Energy Experts will change your meters, explain how to use your Smart Energy Monitor and even show you how to save on your bills by providing Energy Efficiency advice. If you want to pre-register for a smart meter you can do so by entering your details here.  Want to know more about smart meters?

VBreak out the Doc Martens \u2014 you can take now take a trip back to the best decade of them all, the 90\u2019s, anytime, anywhere on Stan.   Here\u2019s 10 of the most defining TV shows and movies of the grunge era, for your viewing pleasure.   Frontline came from Working Dog, the comedy geniuses behind The D Generation, The Late Show and The Castle. It\u2019s a satire of current affairs news reporting that is frighteningly relevant.   16 Emmys and praise from Joe Biden on the treatment of LGBT issues, Will and Grace was a staple of the sitcom genre in the late nineties into the 2000s. Most of us will never forget Karen (Megan Mullaly\u2019s) squeal.    The first one hour drama series that was produced by HBO, it\u2019s dark and often brutal viewing and acted as a forefather for some of your favourite HBO shows. \u000aArnie\u2019s finest hour. If you\u2019ve not seen Terminator 2 you should fix that as soon as possible.    A fascinating doco that investigates the circumstances surrounding Cobain\u2019s death. Love refused to license any of Nirvana\u2019s music and threatened to sue Sundance if they played it at the festival. Compelling stuff.   Nanny Fine, Mr Sheffield and co. were staples of 90s TV. Going back to it is nostalgia filled and it\u2019s worth keeping an eye out for a very young Madeline Zima who went on to star in Californiacation, Heroes and Betas. \u000aThe catch phrase filled, cameo laden James Bond spoof was a box office smash and pop culture phenomenon that even grabbed an Oscar and Grammy nomination.  \u000aJudd Apatow, Paul Feig, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, James Fanco, Martin Starr, Busy Phillips. That\u2019s a pretty impressive list no matter how you look at it. Deserved more than the one season it got. \u000aOne of the defining series of the nineties, Dawson\u2019s Creek shaped teenage culture across its five season run, launching the careers of its young cast, a meme that is arguably as famous and introducing American television to its first gay kiss.  Put this firmly in the so bad it\u2019s great category. Tank Girl is a cult favourite in the truest sense of the word. Keep an eye out for a young Naomi Watts and Ice-T with some fantastic SFX makeup.

VNeed an action movie fix? You\u2019re in luck, because now you can catch John Wick anytime, anywhere on Stan.   Still not convinced? Here\u2019s 10 reasons you should be adding this sweet shooty-punchy-vroom flick to your regular action film marathon lineup. You do have a regular action film marathon, don\u2019t you? \u000aHe\u2019s playing an emotionless, stone faced assassin. It\u2019s a role that\u2019s perfect for Keanu and it shows, his performance is exceptional. You may know Alfie better as Theon Greyjoy from Game of Thrones (or as Lily Allen\u2019s little brother). Turns out he\u2019s equally unlikeable as a Russian gangster\u2019s son.   It\u2019s essentially martial arts with firearms rather than traditional weapons. John Wick is 101 minutes of gun fu magnificence.  \u000aKeanu reportedly did 90% of his own stunts. Once you\u2019ve seen the sheer number of stunts and how intense they are, you\u2019ll realise why that\u2019s impressive Keanu is the obvious link, but directors David Leitch and Chad Stahleski were both stunt coordinators and both acted with Keanu in The Matrix trilogy. 2 days before it\u2019s cinema release John Wick popped up as a playable character in Payday 2. 85% on Rotten Tomatoes with quotes like: \u201cFor a movie in which a dozen people are violently shot in the head John Wick is an awful lot of fun\u201d.   Such was the success of the original that a sequel is in progress with Keanu and the directing team all on board.  The action scenes and stunts are all the more impressive when you find out this was produced on a $20 million budget, more than modest for a movie of this scale.  \u000aJohn Wick (and the Matrix trilogy) are on Stan right now.

V The Galaxy S III has a beautifully large 4.8-inch (720 x 1280) display, crisp 8-megapixel camera, quad-core processor and long-lasting 2100mA h battery. And the speedy new 4G-equipped Galaxy S III model hits Australia on October 9th, complete with Android 4.1 Jellybean. Yet Samsung\u2019s best smartphone also gets the little things right, like nudging you when you\u2019ve missed something. Let\u2019s take a closer look.  As you can see in this video, the Galaxy S III can automatically take a burst of eight shots and select the best one for you. It sees your best side. When you pick up your phone, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if it let you know what you\u2019ve missed while you\u2019ve been gone? The Galaxy S III gives you a vibrating nudge to let you know that you\u2019ve missed a call or message.   When you stare directly at the screen, the Galaxy S III\u2019s 1.9-megapixel front camera looks deep into your eyes and can maintain a bright display for your continued viewing pleasure. The result: auto screen dimming, the way it should be. Another smart Samsung touch: The Galaxy S III knows when you want to talk. When you\u2019re messaging someone and decide to call them instead, simply lift your phone to your ear and Direct Call will dial their number for you. Tell your internet-connected Samsung Galaxy S III to turn off the alarm for a few minutes and let you sleep a bit more, answer or reject calls, turn your music up (or down), and even tell the camera when to shoot##. No more off-kilter shots while moving your thumb to the shoot button!  Speaking of photos, the Galaxy S III can recognise faces using your group profiles, and if you\u2019re online, link them to your friends. Social Tag lets you link the faces in your photo album with your friends\u2019 social media streams*. Once it\u2019s set, all you have to do is look at pictures of your friends while connected and you\u2019ll see their current status appear.   AllShare Play makes it easy to send photos or videos to compatible tablets,\u000aPCs and TVs.

There are the usual suspects when it comes to travel destinations (diners, Hollywood, giant canyons), and then there are these quirky spots you really should be adding to your itinerary. hxdbzxy / Shutterstock.com\u000aWhile the United States isn\u2019t the only country with big trees, it\u2019s the only one with big trees and Master Tree Climbing Instructor Tim Kovar \u2014 an all-round tree enthusiast who wants to introduce you to them, up close and personal.  These locals, like a \u2018gentle\u2019 Oregon White Oak named Pagoda, have been here for longer than any of Oregon\u2019s human inhabitants \u2014 and you\u2019ll probably want to be even closer and more personal with them once you\u2019re 70 feet in the air, swinging from one of Pagoda\u2019s lateral branches.\u000a Doug Kerr / Shutterstock.com\u000a\u201cWe are gathered here today to say goodbye to the dearly de-pinted\u2026\u201c  Yes, that\u2019s right, Ben and Jerry\u2019s flavour graveyard is not just an online list of retired flavours, but an actual, real-life graveyard for varieties ranging from Crème Brûlée, to Turtle Soup, to the beloved Oatmeal Cookie Chunk.  Pay respects to your most sweetly missed pints on this picturesque, gravestone-strewn hill behind the Ben n\u2019 Jerry\u2019s factory \u2014 and why not stop in for a taste of the still-living flavours while you\u2019re there?   Jeffreyw / Flickr.com\u000aCole\u2019s P.E. Buffet is a historic restaurant in Los Angeles, squatting beneath a neon sign that loudly boasts \u2018French-Dipped Sandwiches Since 1908\u2019! The French dip is a LA curiosity, and where better to experience the glory of a meat-filled sandwich dipped in its own juices than at the restaurant that (or so they claim) invented it.  After your deliciously greasy, soggy, meaty sandwich, you can even meander back through the building to a secret Prohibition-era speakeasy for a hand-crafted cocktail.  dalvenjah / Flickr.com\u000aIf you inherited a fortune from your rifle-manufacturing family, what would you spend it on? A house seems like the obvious answer \u2014 but you\u2019ve never seen one like this. Supposedly haunted by the spirits of all those killed by her family\u2019s famous rifles, Sarah Winchester was instructed by a medium to build this home to appease their angry ghosts. Keep an eye out for spirits as you wander through the Mystery House, but don\u2019t lose sight of your group. The house lives up to its name, with baffling staircases, secret passages and doors that open onto blank walls, and visitors have been known to get lost in its winding corridors.  Matt Snodderly / Shutterstock.com\u000aIf you can\u2019t decide on any one destination, why not travel in classic American style and spend your days out on the road instead? California\u2019s State Route 1, or the Pacific Coast Highway, is the USA\u2019s answer to our Great Ocean Road. And it\u2019s every bit as breathtaking.  Whether you\u2019re travelling from LA to San Francisco or the other way around it doesn\u2019t make a difference, just hire a car and join the local population in their sun-kissed summer pilgrimage.  You know where to go, now here\u2019s how to not stand out as a wide eyed tourist.\u000a\u000a1. Drink Local\u000a\u000aAmericans are well known internationally for liking a cold Bud Light \u2014 but did you know that the country is also home to a huge craft beer scene? Pick up an IPA \u2014 a California favourite, or celebrate all things American with a smoked lager, which is the closest thing you can get to bacon-flavoured beer.\u000a\u000a2. Order From The Secret Menu\u000a\u000aCalifornia\u2019s In-N-Out burger chain is iconic \u2014 but did you know they have an extensive secret menu? The menu board may only show five items, however if you ask for a \u2018grilled cheese\u2019 (a cheeseburger without the meat patty), a \u20184 x 4\u2019 (a burger with four meat patties and four slices of cheese) or a burger done \u2018animal style\u2019 (a mustard-cooked patty with extra spread, pickles and onion), then your server will always know what you\u2019re after.\u000a\u000a3. Turning Right Isn\u2019t Wrong\u000a\u000aIn America it\u2019s legal to turn right at any red light after stopping \u2014 just make sure to check on the right side of the road for oncoming traffic!\u000a\u000a4. Leave a Tip\u000a\u000aIn Australia, a 10 per cent tip is considered standard \u2014 but for most places in America, that will be seen as the minimum. Tip 25 per cent of the bill for excellent service, 20 per cent for good service, and 10 per cent for passable service. Some places will add an automatic 20 per cent service charge to the bill \u2014 you don\u2019t have to leave any more than this.\u000a\u000a5. Soup Or Salad?  \u000a\u000aSometimes it seems that Americans have a practiced ritual to dining out, and this baffles most foreigners. Don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re asked \u2018soup or salad\u2019 with every meal. If you pick the salad, you\u2019ll also be asked what dressing you want.

VTwo-thirds of all communication is non-verbal in nature. Get back to face-to-face communication and see the benefits \u2014 for you, your team and the business. Here are just five of the powerful ways video conferencing will improve your workplace. Face-to-face communication increases understanding and helps with faster decision making. Participants in video meetings are more likely to stay alert and focused on what is being discussed. A global survey of 1300 managers published in 2013 found 87% of respondents believed video had a significant and positive organisational impact.  Video collaboration allows you to maintain quality relationships with clients and stay in touch with remote experts at a moment\u2019s notice, without costly travel or delays. You can also save on office space, costly recruiting, and retraining by empowering valuable employees who need to relocate or work from home for a few days.  James R. Brogan of Kohn Pederson Fox Associates, says that because of video conferencing, \u201cTravel is no longer a bottleneck in carrying out our projects. Our clients know that we can maintain frequent contact with them without time or distance being a barrier.\u201d Teams in different offices can stay connected, making decisions in real time via video conference. Telecommuters and remote employees can stay on track, whether mobile, at their desk, or in a team room, and add insights into day-to-day operations and new policies. 68% of HR professionals believe adopting a flexible, mobile work model delivers a competitive advantage (Connected World Technology Report, Cisco, 2014). Participants in video conferences are able to see each other\u2019s facial expressions and body language. This can help meetings feel more personal and build relationships and trust with colleagues, clients and partners. Excessive business travel can burn employees out. Stay connected in a dynamic work environment without having to sacrifice work-life balance. Connect from wherever you are to whomever you need. You\u2019ll lower stress and increase business performance levels. For more information about video conferencing, and a free 30 day trial, visit Cisco.

VThese guys will give you serious career envy. Brought to you by Deakin University\u2019s This. To uncover more unique stories on contemporary topics, visit this.deakin.edu.au Just a few decades ago, video games graphics were simple, one-dimensional box-shaped items that chugged and sputtered across our screens, providing little sensory inspiration. Fast forward to 2015 and video games are cinematic masterpieces that a handful of talented animators are diligently whipping up so that kids and adults alike can experience the ultimate child\u2019s play. Melbourne-based illustrator Simon Boxer was drawn into video games as a child and still inhabits these worlds daily. \u201cMy father and grandfather were both into technology and would download new games for me to play in the early 90s, so I grew up on games like Commander Keen, Crystal Caves, Cosmo\u2019s Cosmic Adventure,\u201d he recalls.  He does have to drop the console for his drawing tools from time-to-time, but at least he\u2019s turned his passion into a money-spinner. As a seven-year-old, Boxer was already developing the skills he\u2019d need to make a living creating video game characters. With a pencil in his tiny hand, he\u2019d draw and draw. By the late 90s, the then teenager had developed intricate skills to emulate the fighter robots in a game called One Must Fall. He describes developing his ability as, \u201can all-consuming, multi-year pursuit.\u201d His precision and flair are not the result of a couple of years of training, but constant development. Although video game illustrations are highly technical, his ideas are always sketched on paper first. He is one of the many cogs turning the still image into moving art. It takes a team including a 3D modeller, a technical artist, an animator and an art director to manage the process. Once he is clear on his initial drawing, he will use Photoshop and an interactive pen and pad known as a Wacom tablet, to create a digital file. He says there are few differences between working as a paper artist and a digital concept artist. In 2015, Boxer has been working on a game called Armello for Australian game studio League of Geeks. \u201cNot all of the tasks are glamorous,\u201d he admits. \u201cSometimes you need to be motivated to get everything done in a timely fashion. Other times it\u2019s easy to get into the workflow and the day will flash by.\u201d Another challenge is the ongoing shifts in hardware and software. Consumer desires change too. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to speculate on what kind of project could be successful,\u201d he points out. On the other side of the globe, 34-year-old Erwin Kho is at his desk in the Netherlands learning computer programming language so that he can illustrate video games and build them, too. He studied visual communications in the Netherlands and went on to work in Amsterdam-based studios as a graphic and motion designer. Berlin-based illustrator Mark Verhaagen nudged Kho into illustration after he saw some of his 3D work and encouraged him to send it to some agencies. Today he\u2019s working as a freelancer and he splits his time working from home, cafes and friends\u2019 studios. He designs in 3D low poly. This is a technique that is used to make 3D models. \u201cThe geometry of the 3D game\u2019s objects needs to be defined enough, but not so detailed that they slow down the processor,\u201d he explains. He\u2019s worked on games for an educational publisher and an independent game studio and uses software called Cinema 4D. \u201cI\u2019d start with pencil sketches based on the game concept. After discussing it with the developers, the sketches would be turned into 3D artwork.\u201d Since Kho started learning game programming, he\u2019s become better equipped to understand how the designs impact the game player\u2019s experience. He created a game called Noodles so he could learn 3D game engine Unity and programming tool C#, but it\u2019s also helped him refine his game illustration, \u201cIt\u2019s been a great way to learn what works, what doesn\u2019t, what makes sense to a player and how you convey the information.\u201d The process is complex. A change in the game\u2019s mechanics during the development will mean re-creating the animation and hours of extra 3D modelling. The other key is the programming, where the visual elements must be integrated with the code. Although it\u2019s complex, Kho says seeing his creations come to life in a game is extremely rewarding. \u201cIt makes the work come alive in new ways and the fact that people can interact with the work is really exciting.\u201d He says the fact that his work is being recognised as art is a bonus. According to Kho, the days of video games being labelled as \u201ckids\u201d entertainment is long gone. However, US-based illustrator Aaron Limonick says that although his job requires considerable skills and dedication, the profession is not always given the respect it deserves. \u201cIt\u2019s this self-fulfilling prophecy where the general public thinks that artists aren\u2019t typically successful for some reason, so kids never go into learning it with the necessary level of seriousness to ultimately be successful.\u201d He encourages young people to treat their professions with the same respect an academic or businessperson would. Thanks to technological advances, the industry\u2019s credibility is on the rise. The ability to use multiple skills to bring a video game\u2019s graphics to life is increasingly valuable. Deakin University motion capture supervisor, Peter Divers, says \u201cEvery next generation console has less restrictions so we can put more and more detail into our characters which gives us more creative freedom.\u201d Divers has had experience working as a motion capture animator on sports games including Rugby League Live 2 and AFL Live. \u201cWhen you know all aspects of the pipeline it makes you a very valuable asset to a team,\u201d he points out. So, you want to be a video game animator too? Many game companies offer internships and there\u2019s a booming indie scene where qualified artists can find work.

V Buying a new phone is often a complicated process. You\u2019ve got hundreds of contacts, photos, videos, music and calendar entries on your old phone, and there\u2019s usually no easy way to get them onto your new handset. If you buy an HTC One, One Mini, or other HTC handset, you can use HTC Switch to simplify the process. HTC Switch lets you upgrade to a new HTC phone from any other Android phone, from an iPhone, or from a range of other Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones.   \u000aSwitching from an iPhone is incredibly simple.  All you have to do is download the HTC Sync Manager software on your PC or Mac, and plug your iPhone in. The Sync Manager software asks you what files, contacts and other media you want to save. HTC\u2019s software takes care of the rest, and tells you when it\u2019s ready to transfer your data and settings to your new phone.  Even easier is switching from another Android device.  If you already have an Android phone and you\u2019re switching to a HTC One or HTC One mini, you can just install the HTC Transfer Tool app from the Google Play Store.  With the app installed on both phones, you follow a simple pairing process to connect the two over Wi-Fi. Follow the instructions in the app to select what you want to transfer \u2014 contacts, messages, calendar appointments, and so on \u2014 then hit the button to migrate your settings to your new HTC phone quickly and easily. If you\u2019ve got an older or non-Android or iOS phone, you can still transfer some or most of your data to your new HTC One or HTC One mini. HTC\u2019s Setup app lets you connect an older phone over Bluetooth and transfer its data, with instructions tailored to the existing handset you\u2019re using. HTC Switch isn\u2019t just about getting settings and data from your old phone, though. It helps you set up your new HTC phone with a personalised wallpaper and ringtone, configure your email account, and find new apps you might be interested in.  HTC Switch makes sure your phone\u2019s configuration and new data is safe from any accidents, by enabling an optional daily backup service that syncs your new HTC phone with Dropbox over Wi-Fi. Once you\u2019ve got your new phone set up with HTC Switch, you won\u2019t have to do it ever again \u2014 it\u2019s as simple as set and forget. Learn how HTC Switch makes upgrading to the HTC One and HTC One mini easy at\u000aHTC Australia\u2019s website.

It also helps that your HTC smartphone can replace your TV remote control.

VSponsored post The BlackBerry Z10 is the first smartphone to run the new BlackBerry 10 operating system, and the device has been met with a good reception following its launch at the end of January. BlackBerry had a tough time in 2012, and reports of redundancies and flagging sales led some to believe BlackBerry had had its day. That was until the Canadian manufacturer unveiled the BlackBerry Z10, the mobile that has the potential to revive the company\u2019s fortunes. BlackBerry has always been known for devices that allow users to communicate quickly and easily, but what\u2019s new about the BlackBerry Z10? Read on for the lowdown on the handset\u2019s features and what they can do for you\u2026 BlackBerry Hub keeps you connected to your conversations at all times  BlackBerry Hub is a handy feature of BlackBerry 10 that collects together message notifications in one area. The hub can be easily accessed via an upward and to the right swipe from within any app or feature of the phone, allowing you to \u2018peek\u2019 in to check for new messages. This functionality is known as BlackBerry Peek, and it basically means you can be playing a game, surfing the web, or doing anything else on your mobile, and view the hub without having to leave any of those things completely. BlackBerry Peek allows you to keep on top of all your conversations while multitasking, and only respond immediately to the messages which are most important to you. BlackBerry Keyboard makes typing texts and emails speedy BlackBerry is famous for its QWERTY phones, and it\u2019s these devices that have been popular with text, email and BBM junkies such as business folk and chatty teenagers. Although BlackBerry has done away with the QWERTY in favour of a touchscreen keyboard on the BlackBerry Z10, typing out messages is still speedy thanks to the keyboard\u2019s intuitive functionality. It learns how you type and figures out which letters you repeatedly hit off-centre, correcting them so you don\u2019t make as many mistakes. Predictive text is on board too, and suggested words appear above the first letter of the word you begin typing so it can be easily \u2018flicked\u2019 into where the message is being composed with an upward swipe gesture. So, no matter whether you\u2019re writing a text, an email, or a social networking message, the BlackBerry Keyboard will allow you to do it quickly and accurately. BBM Video and Screen Share keeps you in visual contact As it\u2019s the 21st century, we\u2019re not just content with keeping in contact via words on a screen. That\u2019s why BlackBerry has seen fit to add video calling functionality to its BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) instant messaging service. Not only that, but the Screen Share feature also on board, which allows you to share whatever is on your screen with the person you\u2019re calling, without stopping the conversation.  For example, you could be chatting to a friend about a new house that has become available to buy. With Screen Share, you can show them pictures of the house from the internet whilst you continue to talk.  No matter what your preferred method of keeping in contact with your friends, family and colleagues, the BlackBerry Z10 really does excel in making keeping in touch as easy as possible. So if you\u2019re a communication junkie, you may want to get a BlackBerry Z10 in your life. To find out more about the BlackBerry Z10 and see the device in action, take a look at our hands-on video review. This guest post was written by  Abbi Cox of Phones 4u, who offer amazing mobile phone deals on handsets such as the BlackBerry Z10 in white and black variants.

V\u000a \u000aThis is a sponsored post on behalf of British Gas The days of estimated bills and letting a man into your house to read the meter are nearing an end. British Gas is starting to roll out Smart Meters which will revolutionise the way we consume energy \u2013 and save us money to boot! Whereas traditionally meters sit in remote places such as under your stairs or in the garage and are only disturbed when the meter reader comes along to take a reading, smart meters aren't even disturbed by the meter reader. Instead, these clever smart meters \u2013 which can  be located in remote locations like their less smart cousins \u2013 communicate wirelessly to an in home display unit, known as a smart energy monitor (see picture). In turn, the Smart Energy Monitor gives you an instant view of your energy consumption for both gas and electricity.  This includes near real-time on energy usage, cost and greenhouse gas generation. You can keep an eye on your energy usage in kwH, CO2 and pounds and pence as well as access historical usage to see how your consumption is changing over time. Unlike traditional meters, with smart readers you can also control your energy usage via a smart phone app or online via a PC. Smart meter readings are sent back to British Gas once a day which means an end to having to submit your own meter readings and also an end to estimated bills. Already there are 160,000 British Gas homes in the UK with a Smart Meter with the company committed to providing Smart Meters in all homes by 2019. Watch the YouTube video below for more information.

Many devices on the market are powered by Android, but the Motorola Xoom will grab headlines for being the first to run Honeycomb, which has been tailor-made for tablets. Honeycomb allows users to customise their Motorola Xoom\u2019s home screen on its 10.1\u2033 HD widescreen display and offers a sleek interface, with neater notifications and clever widgets. Motorola Xoom will be among the most powerful tablets available, packing a dual core processor, with each core running at 1Ghz, to produce sharp images at incredible speed. Graphics, videos and other rich content on the web are central to the joy tablets bring to their owners. Motorola Xoom users will be able to enjoy the best of the web using Adobe Flash Player, whereas Apple\u2019s iPad appears unlikely to include the program any time soon. With a battery life supporting up to 10 hours of video playback, the Motorola Xoom is ideal for watching HD movies on a long journey. It charges in half the time of comparable tablets on the market, so could appeal to people who use their tablet on the go. Its 3D Graphics Engine delivers films the way the director intended, while the Xoom\u2019s built-in stereo speakers complete an immersive viewing experience. Once you\u2019ve exhausted your movie library, you can shoot your own films using the Motorola Xoom\u2019s HD camcorder. The built-in 5MP camera eliminates the need for connector kits which other tablets require. The Motorola Xoom was named Best in Show at this year\u2019s CES and with such an impressive range of features, it is likely to be one of 2011\u2019s biggest gadgets.  Motorola Xoom

The Santa SMS service lets you schedule an SMS from Santa to surprise your loved ones. The site is very straightforward to use: just enter the number, a message of up to 160 characters and a suggested time when you want the message to arrive. (You can also schedule it to be sent immediately, but having it show up first thing on Christmas morning is much more impressive.) If you can\u2019t think of something witty to say, there are also preset messages available you can copy from the site. The sender of the message will be identified as Santa, so no-one will know your involvement. The service costs $3.00 per message, which you can pay for via PayPal. Santa SMS was built by Omnissient, the same team which created Fyels, a Lifehacker favourite for easy file sharing. Fyels has fans in other places as well \u2014 it is used by the Nepalese government and was favourably reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.

The quality is guaranteed to be consistent no matter the environment, since the system is intelligent enough to both assess your chosen room\u2019s unique size, shape and furnishings then adjust accordingly. This is best 5.1 surround sound system Bose has to offer, and that means a premium theatre-like performance you can enjoy from your own couch. Those great moments in entertainment are always immersed in sound. A subtle soundtrack to a film, a nostalgic TV theme, the roar of the crowd at a sporting match, the screeching jump-scare of a video game or that moment you hear your favourite song and can\u2019t help but dance.  The Bose Unify system allows you to effortlessly connect up to 6 HD video and music sources \u2013- like 3D Blu-ray, Pay TV and your gaming console -\u2013 without getting lost. There is a clear, step-by-step, on-screen setup to guide you through the process. It even tells you when you\u2019ve made the right connection. Fully compatible with the SoundTouch adaptor, it\u2019s also simple to use your home\u2019s Wi-Fi to wirelessly stream music from your personal library, internet radio or streaming services like Spotify. The Lifestyle 535 Series III looks fantastic as well. Keeping up with the trend in televisions, the new Jewel Cube Series II speakers have been redesigned with a slimmer profile, are available in black or white, and can be mounted flush to the wall for a sleek look.  If you have a minimalist aesthetic it\u2019s not a problem to hide all of the components including the bass module out of sight, since the universal remote control (with a handy LCD screen to view system information) works even through walls.

VSo who\u2019s unsure about using apps in the workplace? We\u2019re not talking about your public transport or wine app, but apps designed to help your business improve productivity and reduce costs. There is an app for almost every business need, and if you ignore them you risk being left behind while your competitors surge ahead.  Telstra research shows a whopping 75 per cent of small businesses are still reliant on traditional paper-based tools, spending an estimated $608 million a year on paper. And although there are many business apps for smartphones and tablets, only 24 per cent of small businesses are using them in the workplace. Yet business apps can bring huge benefits. They can help you automate manual processes, support document sharing for greater collaboration, electronically sign documents, track tasks, create digital invoices, replace paper forms, gather information in the field, and much more. Woman using smartphone from Shutterstock One of the main benefits of business apps is reducing the amount of paper we use. For example, a common glitch in automated digital processes is stopping everything to print a document for signing, then filing and mailing or faxing it. This can be a waste of time and money. DocuSign is an example of a business app that allows people to easily produce an electronic signature (eSignature) by signing documents on a compatible mobile device with their finger. Electronic signatures speed up business processes by eliminating paper, and reducing employee time spent sending, tracking and handling documents. Not to mention reducing paper, ink, printing, faxing, postage and courier costs. For example, if you are signing up a new customer using an application form or contract, the customer can sign with their finger on a tablet, and return it to you electronically within minutes. Without an eSignature, this process could take days posting, faxing, and chasing signatures. Electronic signatures also create an audit history; they are an easy way to keep track of who authorised a document, and when.  But business apps can also help digitise your paper documents for easy storage and access. For example, the Shoeboxed app scans photos of receipts and invoices then extracts relevant information to sort into common tax categories such as transport and amenities. And once everything is online, it\u2019s easy to generate expense reports. All your records and reports are easily accessible on the go and can be easily shared with your accountant and financial planner. Business apps are taking advantage of cloud computing, making it easier and quicker for small businesses to access and share information as they need it. For example, the Box app stores documents online in the cloud, allowing information and ideas to be shared more quickly. This improves collaboration among your staff, which might give your business the edge over your competitors. Apps on mobile devices allow you to access information \u2013- so you can respond to queries or make decisions \u2013- while you\u2019re on the go. You can make better use of time that would otherwise be unproductive, such as waiting for meetings to start or sitting around in airports. Best of all, it\u2019s easy to start using apps to help your business boost productivity and cut costs. Many apps let you just install and go. Telstra\u2019s making this easy by launching an app store called the Telstra Apps Marketplace, a one-stop shop for business apps.

V var noskimwords = 'true'; Sponsored post  Finding the right home CCTV System for your home or business can be a difficult task. There is a lot to take on board if you want to ensure that you have purchased the best product for your requirements.  CCTV and video surveillance systems are proven to reduce crime, protect people and property. Typical CCTV systems and Home Alarm Systems will consist of a number of cameras and more often than not a digital video recording device (DVR) and viewing monitors, too. While any form of CCTV system that you have in place is better than not having anything in place at all, for peace of mind when it comes to purchasing the best and most effective CCTV equipment it always pays to ensure that you have the right elements in place.  Before purchasing the right CCTV and video surveillance equipment there is plenty to think about. Below we have listed some questions to ask yourself when it comes to buying surveillance equipment.\u000a\u000a1). What do I need it for?\u000aIf you are looking for a CCTV camera system for a large office space, or work area, your exact requirements will be completely different to what you would want for your home surveillance. A top tip is to think about what you are going to actually need your surveillance camera for. 2). High or Low Risk?\u000aYou may be able to answer this question from the first, but not always. For example, you may want a CCTV system for a shop installed, but how high a risk is the shop to fall victim to burglary after hours? Or is it more likely that your CCTV system is being installed to track pick-pockets and petty theft. If so, you may require a different type of surveillance system. Likewise, for your home you may feel fairly secure and live in an area where you think the chances of being robbed or broken into are low. While you can never be 100% sure that you will not become the victim of a robbery or theft, you may not want to invest in buying everything you can for what you perceive to be a low risk.  3). What extras do I need?\u000aCCTV technology has advanced considerably in recent years. Improvements in technology, cheaper costs and more expertise in terms of deployment mean that the days of installing a single camera hooked up to a video recorder are well and truly in the past. So a question to ask yourself when looking in to CCTV systems is \u2013 what extras do I need exactly?  For example you can today choose from a whole range of security measures. These include items such as fast alarm response, perimeter protection, personal attack monitoring and even devices such as anti-theft fog deterrents (fog released into an area to deter any intruders). Meanwhile when it comes to your home you may feel more secure by installing a door entry system. The benefits for a door entry system means that you will be able to view and speak to visitors before you let them into your home.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a There\u2019s a reason why the Motorola ATRIX is considered to be one of the best Android phones around. It comes with some impressive specs that essentially gives you access to a mobile computer inside your pocket. Let\u2019s take a closer look.   The Motorola ATRIX is built around a dual-core processor that pumps out 2GHz of processing power and super fast speeds with 1GB RAM. Web pages load twice as fast as single-core phones. It also comes with a huge 16GB of internal memory, plus room for a 32GB microSD card, so removing apps and content to make more space can be a thing of the past.  One of the most exciting features about the Motorola ATRIX is its beautiful 4-inch qHD display with Gorilla Glass, and a beautiful 960×540 resolution for sharper, smoother images. It\u2019s one of the highest resolution screens around. You can capture full HD video and take stunning photos thanks to a 5MP camera with dual LED flash, and it\u2019s all supported by a large 1930mAh battery for longer battery life. The Motorola ATRIX also has something that no other smartphone has: biometric fingerprint recognition technology. That means only you can access your phone and its contents, making it faster and more secure than PINs and pattern locks.  This clever technology is available only on the Motorola ATRIX, right now. See more at Telstra\u2019s website. What has something changed? Was looking into this phone couple months ago and the specs were only a 1ghz dual core not 2ghz... It may be smart but I cant add a contact. The phone only sends contact information to a motoblur account or a gail account and then downloads the information to the sim card. No good at all if the nearest tower is 200 Km away.\u000aWould you believe that I have to carry a small notebook to write down contact information (just like the old days).\u000aI do not have a motoblur account or a gmail account I just want to add a contact to the sim card. HOw hard can that be.\u000aSo maybe the Atrix isn't so smart afterall.\u000aBill

Your physical location and private messages, for instance, are not necessarily things you want to broadcast.  Yet every time you enter your address on the internet, you leave yourself open for exploitation. Especially if the service is hacked. And your devices themselves possess a lot of information about who you are and what you do. There are simple strategies for you to try and claw back some of your privacy in the internet age. Configure your devices to stop them giving away your information, ask services to stop sharing your data, and try out some of the numerous services that stop scripts and trackers. But what may be the best strategy to protect your location online is also an old school one \u2014 get a Post Office Box. Your location can\u2019t be compromised if you never give it out in the first place \u2014 if you list your local post office box to accept deliveries. With a PO Box, your mailbox becomes a screen between you and the internet, rather than a gap in your defenses.  Even better, a PO Box defends your mail. Instead of being readily accessible to neighbours and passers-by, a PO Box puts your mail behind lock and key away from prying eyes. And it protects it all from the elements \u2014 rain and shine. This is especially useful if you\u2019re going to be away for any stretch of time. You can also get alerts to let you know when you have mail to collect. With Mail2Day alerts, you can receive a delivery notifications on your smartphone, tablet or computer. Don\u2019t let your mail hang around for a second longer than it needs.  And with even more parcels flying around every day, a PO Box provides the perfect solution for when you shop online \u2014 a delivery without giving out your home address. To sign up for a PO Box for you or your business, download an application form or pick one up at your nearest participating Post Office.\u000a\u000aThis article is provided for general information purposes only and is not intended to be specific advice for your needs.

VOne of the most popular sitcoms of all time, Friends ran for 10 seasons from the mid-90\u2019s and the adventures of Monica, Chandler, Rachel, Ross, Joey and Phoebe were a huge part of our lives. Now you can take a trip down memory lane anytime, anywhere on Stan.   Here are 10 of our favourite episodes from the much-loved series.  Season 5, Episode 8\u000aEvery Episode Of Friends Is Now On Stan! Here Are Our 10 Favourites\u000aAlthough the Thanksgiving meal is great, Chandler and Ross are both moody over divorce. The group reminisces about their worst Thanksgivings in order to cheer them up, and Monica\u2019s worst memory is revealed. Taking a trip down \u201cworst thanksgivings\u201d lane has never been so comical. From Phoebe\u2019s past lives to Joey\u2019s close encounter with a turkey, we\u2019ll never look at toes diced carrots the same again.  Season 5, Episode 14 When Phoebe finds out about Monica and Chandler, she and Rachel start messing with them and attempt to get them to confess their relationship. Watching Monica and Chandler keep their secret romance hidden provided lots of LOLs, but watching them try to outwit Phoebe in a game of fake seduction gives us as many laughs as #relationshipgoals  Season 2, Episode 14 The gang watch a home video from the night of Monica and Rachel\u2019s prom. Joey gives Chandler a hideous bracelet. It doesn\u2019t do it often, but when Friends gets sentimental we all weep. Plus, flashback hair!  Season 4 Episode 8 Chandler desperately tries to earn Joey\u2019s forgiveness. Monica accidentally gets ice in her eye and her doctor turns out to be Richard\u2019s son. Chandler spends the episode in a box. Need we say more?!  Season 6, Episode 17 Rachel and Phoebe take self-defense classes. Chandler and Monica agree to give each other homemade presents for Valentine\u2019s Day. Joey tries to get money through medical research. We can\u2019t decide what\u2019s better: a surprise audio cameo from Janice, or Ross trying to teach Phoebe and Rachel the art of karaté. Ahhh\u2026 Unagi.  Season 5, Episode 16 Joey has a dream about Monica and becomes convinced he is in love with her. Meanwhile, Phoebe finds a police badge in Central Perk, and Ross tries to get his new sofa into his apartment. We\u2019ve all been Ross trying to PIVOT a couch up the stairs.  Season 4, Episode 24 Phoebe tries to warn the gang that Rachel is coming to London to tell Ross she still loves him. Ross and Emily\u2019s parents get into an argument over the bill for the wedding. HE SAID RACHEL!!!  Season 2, Episodes 12 and 13 The gang follow Ross to California while he tries to visit Marcel, who is now working in commercials. Whilst there Chandler runs into a former class mate and the girls only have eyes for human star Jean-Claude Van Damme. OK this is a two-parter, but this pinpoints the exact moment in time that Friends proved it was a bona fide hit. What other show could get Julia Roberts, Chris Isaak, Brook Shields and Jean-Claude Van Damme in the same episode(s) at the height of their fame?  Season 3, Episode 3 Monica tries to get over Richard by using her free time to make jam and considers artificial insemination through a sperm bank. Phoebe is stalked by a man who mistakes her for Ursula. The one where Phoebe gets recognised as her porn-famous twin sister, Ursula. Anyone know where we can get a copy of Buffay: The Vampire Layer? Seriously.  Season 1, Episode 16 Phoebe feels neglected when Joey falls for her twin sister. Chandler struggles to fire an attractive co-worker. Ross attends Lamaze classes with Carol and Susan. Early on in the show\u2019s run, this episode proved nothing was too outrageous by having Lisa Kudrow play Phoebe\u2019s \u201cevil\u201d twin sister, Ursula. Later on we\u2019d also see David Schwimmer transform into Rachel\u2019s new dope of a boyfriend, Russ.

VFew people consider the role a portable GPS device can play in assisting a driver\u2019s safety on the road. Lack of concentration and stress behind the wheel are common causes of road accidents. Portable GPS devices can help give a driver greater situational awareness enabling them to make smarter safer decisions on the road.  It\u2019s important that your in-car navigation device is equipped with the basics, like red light camera alerts, speed limit information, speed camera alerts, school zones, lane guidance and railway crossing alerts. While most devices offer these features, the size of the database that houses these features is important.   Whereis® maps provide a massive, database of road guidance and alerts, plus extras like photo-realistic views of junctions and road signs. In an Australian first Whereis® maps also provide 3D views of cities.  You just need to ensure that the device you\u2019re considering supports Whereis® maps.  Footnote: Garmin, TomTom and Uniden all feature Whereis® maps. Make sure you keep an eye out for their devices.

Did you ever play Lunar Lander on a PDP-11 with the VR-17 vector graphics display and the  light pen to control attitude and thrust? That was before 1979. This was a machine with 64K of core memory. Specifically, the system I was using was a PDP-11/40 with VR-17 vector graphics - packaged as a "GT-40" system running RT-11. If you landed successfully close enough to the proper landing point, an astonaut would descend the ladder from the LEM, and walk a short distance across the lunar surface to the McDonalds store. The graphics even had dust kicking up as you came close to the lunar surface. 50,798 before I got bored...

VIf you build web sites and apps, you need to be at Microsoft\u2019s REMIX conference in Sydney in early June. Amongst the topics you can master? Windows Azure. One of the many presentations taking place at REMIX is on \u201cTen (ish) things you didn\u2019t know you could do with the Windows Azure Platform\u201d. The presenter, Steven Nagy, is a Windows Azure MVP and a Senior Consultant with Readify. Here\u2019s the official brief on his session: \u000aThe Windows Azure platform offers more than just the scale out PaaS features you are familiar with. In this session we\u2019ll explore some of the less well known features of the platform and new ways to leverage existing features to build highly scalable applications in the cloud and hybrid scenarios.\u000a Eagle-eyed readers will also recall that consulting time with Steven is part of the prize in our awesome My Concept Rules competition to build an app based on Windows Azure technology. Other sessions at REMIX will cover Silverlight, HTML5, CSS3, Windows Phone 7 and WebMatrix. Whatever your role in building sites, there\u2019ll be something new to learn. REMIX runs at the Seymour Centre in Sydney on June 1 and 2; there\u2019s a preliminary keynote and party to kick things off on June 1, and then a full day of sessions on Day 2. Right now, there\u2019s an early bird special of $210 which is available online. (The full price is $310; REMIX has sold out for the last four years, so get in quick.) The other way to get there?

VSponsored post Currently top of the list of trends in video game genre we all thought had died: the me-too kart racing game. Between SEGA & All-Stars Racing Transformed, Little Big Planet Karting and the bizarre bobble-heads of F1 Race Stars, we\u2019re pretty sure that every single base has been covered. Well, unless they go with these:\u000a Mass Effect Karting\u000aA galaxy-spanning kart game with circuits on a large variety of planets, featuring a cast of playable drivers drawn from the story of the main trilogy. The chief gimmick of the game is the branching nature of the circuits: after every second turn, the player must choose the \u201cParagon\u201d and \u201cRenegade\u201d route. The former is often fraught with less danger, whereas the latter is usually quicker and more direct.\u000aOf course, despite the thousands of routes available through each course, the driver always ends up in the same final straight. À la Karte\u000aFrom the blurb: \u201cÀ la Karte is a new interactive experience crafted by a team of professional game artists, featuring the finest characters and abstract concepts from the indie art game scene on its driving roster. Players will actuate through seven environments dense with atmosphere and metaphor: petty jubilation will not be the only emotion elicited from the player when the chequered flag falls.\u201d\u000aIn À la Karte, you\u2019d likely be able to choose from the following famous characters:\u000a\u2022 Julian Luxemburg, the protagonist from \u201cDinner Date\u201d\u2022 The Narrator from \u201cDear Esther\u201d\u000a\u2022 The Elderly Woman from \u201cThe Graveyard\u201d\u000a\u2022 The Gust of Wind from \u201cFlower\u201d\u000a\u2022 The eight pixel high protagonist from \u201cPassage\u201d\u000a\u2022 The Concept of \u201cCuriosity\u201d from the Peter Molyneux game of the same name\u000a\u2022 The Weight of Society\u2019s Expectations Regarding the Performance of Gender in both Public and Personal Spaces, from \u201cDys4ia\u201d. Kart of Duty\u000aWith falling sales and stagnant critical reception, Activision makes a welcome announcement: Black Ops and Modern Warfare titles will alternate with a release every year. But what of the profits to be reaped from the COD faithful? The answer is obvious: Call of Bejewelled. Then somebody remembers that EA owns Pop Cap (and Peggle of Honor was a failure). Upping their game, somebody puns \u201cKart of Duty\u201d onto a whiteboard, an executive greenlights the project, and an easily jettisoned development studio begins work.\u000aBut imagine all of Call of Duty\u2019s memorable characters in one place. You know, like that dudebro who crawls about in a nuclear explosion. Or the non-dudebro scientist who gets blown up in space by a nuclear explosion. Tracks include explosions in the vein of Split Second: Velocity, including a track where you race on an explosion, in an explosion, against explosions. Final Fantasy Dewey Decimal Karting\u000aOnce upon a time, a Final Fantasy character was put into retirement after staring in a sixty hour RPG. They didn\u2019t owe us anything. Then nostalgia and creative bankruptcy happened (also, actual looming real bankruptcy, thank you very much Spirits Within) and Final Fantasy characters ended up inserted sideways into everything. Sequels, Disney Action RPGs, fighting games, rhythm action games \u2013 but never a racing game.\u000aNo, Chocobo Racing doesn\u2019t count. Where are the uncomfortable cameos, the dense \u201ctime and space are ending\u201d storyline and the ill-fitting RPG elements? This isn\u2019t just any old karting game: it\u2019s Final Fantasy Dewey Decimal Karting, and you can file it in section 125 because the fun doesn\u2019t stop. PC Gaming Kart\u000aWhen a platform holder comes of age, it starts making crossover games: Nintendo has Smash Bros, the SEGA Superstars series, Sony has Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale, and even someone like SNK has a crossover with Capcom. I can\u2019t think of a Microsoft equivalent, but then they barely into their second decade \u2013 Sony really seemed to struggle to include characters, having to loan in all kinds of non-Playstation exclusives (Big Daddy\u2019s inclusion is especially odd when you remember that Bioshock was a year late to the PS3).\u000aThe PC on the other hand, has been around a lot longer, and has a range of iconic characters you can stick in a kart, licensing issues be damned. Some of them would even look kind of appropriate. Candidates include:\u000a\u2022 Commander Keen\u000a\u2022 The Avatar (Ultima)\u000a\u2022 Elaine Marley (Monkey Island)\u000a\u2022 Jazz Jackrabbit\u000a\u2022 The Doom Marine\u000a\u2022 SHODAN (System Shock)\u000a\u2022 Duke Nukem\u000a\u2022 Gordon Freeman (Half-Life)\u000a\u2022 Boo the Space Hamster (Baldur\u2019s Gate)\u000a\u2022 Cate Archer (No One Lives Forever)\u000a\u2022 Alice Liddell (Alice: Madness Returns)\u000a\u2022 Sarah Kerrigan (Starcraft)\u000a\u2022 The Heavy (Team Fortress 2)\u000a\u2022 Minecraft Steve This is definitely the least terrible of the ideas on this page. \u000a Steph Woor is a\u000acontent writer for Nationwide Vehicle Contracts, a car leasing company based in the UK

V Your phone is the one piece of technology that you always carry with you. It\u2019s also your music player and your video viewer, but you don\u2019t always have headphones or a portable speaker handy. That\u2019s why it makes sense to pick the phone that has the best sound built in \u2014 and that\u2019s the HTC One and new HTC One mini. Plenty of phones have speakers on their rear or base, firing away from you when you\u2019re looking at the screen. This means sound is muffled, indistinct, and quiet. The HTC One and HTC One mini are different \u2014 both boast speakers on the front; above and below the screen.  These \u2018BoomSound\u2019 forward-firing speakers direct the sound right at you, meaning better audio with clearer quality. If you\u2019re going to be using your phone\u2019s speakers at all, having a front-facing setup is the way to go. Having speakers facing towards the front of the screen also allows the BoomSound tech to provide louder sound \u2014 giving you a better listening experience if you\u2019re in a noisy environment, or if you\u2019re sharing your music or videos with friends. Front-facing speakers also mean you can keep the volume lower without losing clarity if you don\u2019t want to disturb anyone around you. Within the HTC One and HTC One mini, a Beats Audio amplifier and equaliser helps music sound richer and fuller. The built-in amplifier also allows the stereo speakers to perform at louder, crowd-pleasing volumes.  Audio professionals mix music and movies to sound better in stereo, giving different effects to the left and right channels \u2014 it\u2019s part of what makes the music in your headphones sound more exciting, and what makes a movie seem so immersive. Listening to music or watching a movie on your phone shouldn\u2019t be any different. Yet plenty of phones only have a single speaker, muddling all these complex stereo effects together. HTC\u2019s BoomSound stereo speakers let you enjoy music as the producers intended. With two speakers, BoomSound on the HTC One and HTC One mini is made for sharing music with your friends. The speakers surround the screen when you\u2019re holding it sideways to watch a video, giving you proper stereo sound for your movies or YouTube clips. Stereo speakers mean clearer, more detailed sound that sounds less muddled and more musical. HTC worked with Beats Audio on its speakers and amplifier tech to get the best sound possible, and the results can certainly be heard. \u000aListen to the difference that HTC BoomSound makes on the HTC One at HTC Australia\u2019s website.\u000a

VDeveloping for Windows 8 lets you build quickly for phone, PC and cloud platforms \u2014 and the forthcoming #Appfest event in Sydney from Friday 15 February to Sunday 17 February will help you super-charge your app ambitions. We chatted to Vaughan Knight, developer relations manager for Nokia Australia, for his perspective on how #Appfest can help developers build a successful future. Knight sees multiple benefits in an event like #Appfest. \u201cYou get to be surrounded for three days by experts \u2014 people who understand not just the technical aspects of app development but the logistical elements you need to make the apps a success.\u201d Presenters include Microsoft\u2019s chief experience evangelist Chris Bernard and Shane Morris from Automatic Studios. Outside the presentations, the focus is on hacking and designing prototypes. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge benefit to setting aside and really dedicating that time,\u201d Knight said. \u201cYou have no distractions so you can go head down and really give yourself that focus. By setting that challenge, it throws the gauntlet down. You\u2019ve got a weekend. Prove what you can do. Giving that confidence to the developer community is great.\u201d Knight also highlighted the networking benefit of spending time with like-minded developers. \u201cThat community aspect of a group of like-minded people is so important. You often meet other people working on similar projects. Twitter and forums just don\u2019t help build that community in the same way. Appfest is a great place to get motivated.\u201d \u201cA lot of the time developers tend to work in their own little shell They don\u2019t always collaborate with a diverse group of people. That cross-pollination is always helpful.\u201d \u201cYou can often hit a barrier and it can be demotivating. What you want to be able to do is be in an environment where keep that momentum. For every app that\u2019s built and submitted, there are probably 20 that are created but not submitted. It\u2019s about getting over that last hurdle.\u201d\u201d One huge advantage of Windows 8 development is the ability to target Windows 8 Phone devices such as the Nokia Lumia 920, Windows 8 PCs and tablets and Windows Azure cloud services with the same well-established Microsoft developer tools. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on a lot of platforms, and the Windows 8 family has the strongest developer story,\u201d Knight said. \u201cYou can build and prototype so quickly, which allows you to iterate your prototypes effectively over short periods of time. We\u2019re seeing developers preferring to start in Windows Phone 8. While they\u2019re iterating, the costs are low and the time frames are short. You can turn around prototypes in a couple of hours versus a couple of weeks. The tools are rich and the development platform is very mature.\u201d The ultimate goal for all attendees is creating a successful app. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about coding and building apps, it\u2019s about making apps that succeed. Developers need to understand that this can be the future for them. You don\u2019t need to be Rovio to be successful. You can have your own indie games studio and being successful. You need to define what success looks like. Is success working full time or having 100,000 downloads?\u201d \u201cWindows Phone is really making it easy for developers to build apps, but it also allows Nokia to reach out to the vast audience of Microsoft developers. There\u2019s this army of developers who have been waiting for a phone they can develop for. When you start seeing projects that have 90% reuse between different platforms, you start seeing very impressive ROI.\u201d Knight\u2019s focus for #Appfest will be in helping developers move quickly from concept to a shipping product. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen one day events where people have built apps and submitted to store on that day. In a three-day event, they\u2019ll be able to build everything. My challenge to developers is going to be: you can submit to store.\u201d

VModelled after the animal kingdom\u2019s fiercest predator to give you maximum efficiency with your run, the Mobium Elite has opened up a whole new movement with adaptive running.\u000a As you run, your foot expands in three directions: longitudinally, laterally and vertically. PUMA\u2019s new Adaptive Running technology takes the body in motion into account to encourage a more natural and efficient mid-foot strike, while taking these principles of movement into account. It does this by leveraging on three main features: Expansion Pods, Mobium Band and Windlass Chassis. The shoe is inspired by the cat, the planet\u2019s most efficient running machine. Designers looked at what makes cats so efficient and fast, and how the human foot moves in similar ways. The adaptive Mobium features are designed to work with the natural rhythm of your foot to improve movement.   Mobium Elite\u2019s cushioning, protection and flexibility encourages a more efficient stride and offers runners a smoother transition. The Mobium Elite has been subjected to rigorous and intensive testing for two years to ensure that it is a dynamic product for runners of all levels. The Mobium Elite is aimed at neutral runners who enjoy a cushioned shoe and train longer distances and are mid-foot strikers. Mid-foot striking is widely known to be a more efficient way of running, versus a hard heel strike. Mobium Elite provides the runner cushioning and protection not always found in minimal and \u2018barefoot\u2019 products, making it the perfect balance for runners.

VStan has landed on Playstation and to celebrate, here are 10 comedies available to view anytime, anywhere, on Stan that will keep the good mood keeping on. A range of side-splitters from the US, UK and Australia make the cut, and there\u2019s a sneaky little bonus at the end. Go forth and laugh.  We shouldn\u2019t really need to say this because you really should have watched Community by now. Six seasons of Dan Harmon lunacy (well five technically, but still) have created one of the best comedies of the 2000s. Still waiting on that movie\u2026.  Matt Parker and Trey Stone\u2019s masterpiece is perfect binge viewing. Special shout out to Obama Wins (S16 EP14) as a perfect way to finish off a binge.   Featuring some of your favourite actors (Adam Scott, Lizzy Caplan, Martin Starr, Jane Lynch, Megan Mullally amongst plenty of others) and from the writer of Veronica Mars and iZombie, Party Down should have lasted longer than two seasons. Enjoy those two seasons. Treasure them.    David Mitchell and Robert Webb created eight seasons of uncomfortable, awkward brilliance. Cringe, squirm and cry with laughter at Jez, Mark, Super Hans and the gang.   Frontline was created in the mid 90s and it (somewhat worryingly) still holds true more than 20 years later. This satire of news and current affairs teams is an absolute must watch.   The boy\u2019s adventures have taken them through the UK and Ireland, USA, Australia and New Zealand, Asia, Europe, India, South America and Christmas. There are nine seasons of antics and belly laughs from two of Australia\u2019s most loved comedians.   The most serious title on this list, UnREAL is dark, twisted and wickedly funny in parts. A reality dating show was never so damn interesting\u2026.   If you\u2019ve ever worked in IT you\u2019ll understand the struggles of Roy and Moss better than most, for the rest of us it\u2019s four seasons of utter genius. Moss is the role Richard Ayoade was born to play.   A charming UK series about a supermarket and the characters who work in it and pass through it. It boasts that it finds \u2018funny in the familiar\u2019 and that\u2019s actually a fairly accurate representation.   There will never be anything else like The Mighty Boosh and we\u2019d love to live inside Noel Fielding\u2019s head for a day. That is all.  Stan\u2019s very own original comedy series drops on the platform this Thursday. From the makers of The Moody\u2019s, The Elegant Gentleman\u2019s Guide To Knife Fighting and Review with Myles Barlow and featuring some of Australia\u2019s best comedic talent (plus some huge guest stars) this is one to look out for!

VWhat\u2019s better than doing the whole tourist thing? Travelling like you know the place. Here\u2019s our pick of the top quirky destinations and travel hacks to have you exploring Indonesia like you\u2019ve been there a thousand times \u2014 even if it\u2019s your first time.\u000aMawardi Bahar / Shutterstock.com Travel Tips with Lifehacker is presented in partnership with Visa, the easier and more secure way to take your money overseas. With Visa you can behave like a traveller, #notatourist.  There are the usual suspects when it comes to exploring Indonesia (bars, beaches and too many bogans), and then there are these quirky spots you really should be adding to your itinerary. Pius Lee / Shutterstock.com These \u2018Holy Hot Springs\u2019 in the north of Bali are a little out of the way, but well worth the visit for a few hours of pure relaxation. With three pools of natural hot spring water, you can relax under the flow of water from a carved stone naga\u2019s mouth, or paddle in the largest pool to cool off. Don\u2019t let the touristy shops that crowd the way in fool you \u2014 Banjar Hot Springs is mainly visited by locals. They even claim the warm, mineral-rich waters can cure any skin condition.   Cybervelvet / Shutterstock.com Indonesia is a blessed country with beautiful beaches around every corner, but Blue Point Beach \u2014 also known as Suluban \u2014 is a little different. To get there you will have to descend a narrow concrete staircase, because this beach is nestled inside a natural cave.\u000aBring a board and join the locals at this surfer\u2019s paradise, or just take a dip in gentler waters next to the wall of the cave. Either way, it\u2019s likely this Pecatu favourite will make for your favourite beach day in Bali.  While Indonesia is full of galleries, none have quite the personality or the pop of this little gem in Ubud \u2014 and most of that that can be attributed to the eccentric artist Symon himself. Filled to the brim with colourful Indonesian pop art, the so-called \u2018Art Zoo\u2019 is the very definition of quirky.  Hang around and have a chat with Symon, or simply browse the many pieces of art on display. You might even find the perfect piece for your wall at home.  Vladislav T. Jirousek / Shutterstock.com\u000aAlthough it\u2019s only a few kilometres off the coast of Kuta, Bali\u2019s party central, Nusa Penida gives you the chance to get away from the rush of tourists. Instead of joining the crowds, take a day out to explore Penida\u2019s dramatic and beautiful cliffs. One of the most breathtaking spots on the island is the so-called \u2018broken beach,\u2019 a place where the sea has carved out a circular lagoon through a single breach in the cliff face.\u000aIf you\u2019re visiting Nusa Penida, why not dive with the locals \u2014 in this case, the huge manta rays that live in the waters around the island.  Edmund Lowe Photography / Shutterstock.com Although you might find yourself a victim of temple fatigue by this point in your Indonesian holiday, Gunung Kawi mountain temple is still worth a visit. This ancient temple is far lesser known than crowded attractions like Tanah Lot, as well as being one of the most historically rich sites in Bali. Carved out of the rock of the mountain itself are shrines to ancient Balinese kings, where locals still leave offerings to this day.\u000aWander down to this temple from the busy main street of Tampaksiring, passing through lush rice paddies as you enter the sacred valley.  You know where to go, now here\u2019s how to not stand out as a wide eyed tourist. \u000a1. Pick The Right Drink\u000a\u000aWhile relaxing at the beachside bar at sunset, you\u2019re best to pass up the wine list and go for a beer or a cocktail instead. Wine is expensive to import and although you\u2019ll find most alcohol will be cheaper than it would be here, you\u2019ll probably end up paying more for a bottle of wine than it\u2019s worth.\u000a\u000a2. Learn The Language\u000a\u000aBahasa Indonesia is an easy language to learn, with simple grammar rules and straightforward pronunciation, so why not try and throw in a few local phrases here and there?\u000a\u201cApa kabar\u201d is one to remember, basically meaning \u201chow are you?\u201d. Generally you would respond with a \u201cbaik\u201d or \u201cbaik-baik\u201d for a positive response. \u201cTolong\u201d means please and \u201cterima kasih\u201d means thank you, while the proper toast to say when drinking is \u201csanti!\u201d\u000a\u000a3. Become A Millionaire\u000a\u000aIndonesia\u2019s currency is the Indonesian Rupiah, and currently 1 Australian dollar will buy you more than 10,000 of them \u2014 so don\u2019t freak out when you see prices in rupiah going into the millions!\u000a\u000a4. You\u2019ve Got To Haggle!\u000a\u000aBargaining is a way of life in Indonesia, so never pay the first price quoted to you! If you\u2019re unsure, asking if they can do a better price is a good way to open negotiations. Making a first offer of half of what you\u2019d like to eventually spend can be a good rule of thumb when bartering.\u000a\u000a5. Treat Yourself  \u000a\u000aWhether you want the full royal treatment or just a quick massage after a beach day, don\u2019t be afraid to visit one of Indonesia\u2019s many spas for a cheaper and oftentimes more luxurious spa experience than you could ever find in Australia. It\u2019s your holiday \u2013 you deserve it!      Travel Tips with Lifehacker is presented in partnership with Visa, the easier and more secure way to take your money overseas.

VSo you are in\u000athe market for a new phone. That old iPhone/Nokia/Samsung has served you well\u000abut it is time to move on to bigger and better things?  There are of course a\u000ahuge number of handsets on sale now ranging from the latest iPhone through to\u000athe Windows powered Nokia Lumix range, but the phone that stands apart from the\u000arest is the Samsung Galaxy S3. But don\u2019t just take our word for it. The phone has already won numerous awards from a variety of publications including phone of the year at the T3 Awards. Here then are\u000afive reasons why you should take a look at the S3. 1 Gestures  One of the smartest things about the S3 is that it takes Gestures \u2013 which have been\u000aavailable on a number of phones now to another level. Gestures enable you to control your phone simply by moving it. So for example if you want to make a call to a person whose number is on the\u000ascreen you can do this by moving the phone to you face. The phone automatically\u000arings them. There are other very useful Gestures too such as shaking to update\u000athe information on the screen or tilting the phone to zoom in on an image on\u000athe screen. A word of warning though. Most of the Gestures have to be activated\u000abefore they will work so take a look at your settings when you get the phone\u000aand tick the motion activation box. 2 The screen The Samsung Galaxy S3 boasts a real state of the art screen. For starters it is one of the biggest screens available. The HD Super AMOLED screen comes in at 4.8 inches,\u000awhich is a,lot bigger than its rival handsets.  So why would you want a bigger\u000ascreen? Well websites, books and images look so much bigger (and better) and\u000apersonally I think if you have used a phone with a big screen you won\u2019t go\u000aback. Secondly the screen has a maximum resolution of 720 x 1280. which is as bright and as\u000adetailed as almost all its rivals. It really looks crisp and clear. 3 The apps\u000a If you are worried that the apps you have on your current smartphone won\u2019t be available on the S3 think again. Almost all the new-ish apps developed for other major\u000aplatforms work on the S3 and there is a growing number that are unique to the\u000aplatform. The S3 uses the Android operating system \u2013 which is now the most popular smartphone platform in the world \u2013 and Google Play store \u2013 which as you might imagine is stacked out with games, apps and content. For a list of the ten apps to download first go here. 4 Battery  Battery life was something that Samsung was very keen to improve on with this phone. On the S3 the battery runs significantly longer than the S2. The S2 did have one of\u000athe longest battery running times of any smartphone and now the S3 has trumped\u000athat. 5 Performance  Samsung has included a quad-core 1.4GHz Exynos processor in the Galaxy S3, and added 1GB RAM. What that means is that the phone is very quick to process what you\u000arequest it to do. So it will fire up very swiftly and has no problems shifting\u000abetween the apps. As for storage the handset is available in 16, 32 and 64 GB guises and you can further add to that via its micro SD card slot. If you haven\u2019t bought a Samsung Galaxy S3 yet try Carphone Warehouse for some great deals.   Sponsored\u000aPost  First para\u2026\u201d..through to the Windows powered Nokia Lumix range..\u201d do you mean Lumia?

VWhen you\u2019re taking a photo with your camera, you can\u2019t always guarantee you\u2019ll hit the shutter button at just the right time. This happens most often with group photos \u2014 with so many faces to look at, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll end up with one or more closed eyes, odd expressions or other problems with your photo. The HTC One and new HTC One mini solve these problems by making it easy to take group photos.  They boast a host of features that can clean up your images and combine multiple frames into one to capture a single impressive group portrait.  All these features revolve around the HTC\u2019s Zoe camera mode. Zoe captures 20 photos and three seconds of video with a single press of the shutter button, and saves all these photos as a single batch for easy sorting. So all you\u2019ve got to do is select Zoe mode, frame your group shot and hit that camera button.  After you\u2019ve saved a Zoe, you can tweak it several different ways to get the best group shot. All you need to do is find the Zoe in your HTC One or HTC One mini photo gallery and hit the Edit button, and choose the Retouch menu. You can choose the Always Smile option, which lets you scroll through a list of photos for each face in your group photo and pick the most attractive one. You can use the Face Contour mode to slim down cheekbones and jaw lines, and touch up makeup with Skin Smoothing and Eye Enhancer. If you\u2019ve got intrusive movement in the background of your photo, use Object Removal to intelligently find and edit them out.  Taking group photos is incredibly easy. Zoe mode captures multiple photos and video with a single click, and lets you edit your images simply to get the best possible group shot. \u000aSee why the HTC One and new HTC One mini are perfect for group photos at\u000aHTC Australia\u2019s website.

V\u000a Sponsored post Banking has come a long way since the images of middle aged men in grey suits, bowler hats and drab coloured high street banks. It seems Virgin entrepreneur Richard Branson is not only planning to shake up the tarnished reputation of the banking industry \u2013 but actually make banking sexy. At least, that is, if last night\u2019s official launch of Virgin Money at central London\u2019s Senate House is anything to go by. In town to promote his new banking concept, Richard Branson himself kick-started the launch with a fantastic projection mapping display on the side of the iconic building.  Featuring 20 projectors throwing out a massive amount of light across the 200ft high building, the 270 degree display both looked and sounded amazing. The two and a half minute ad featured iconic images from the Virgin stable including hot air balloons, trains, planes, even space shuttles. And at the end of the dazzling display the Virgin Money logo appeared with the strapline: \u201c40 years of better. Now in a bank.\u201d Later Richard Branson told the BBC:  \u201cPeople are suspicious of banks and they have good reason to be after the last few years.  \u201cThe Virgin brand is well trusted and has always offered good products in a range of different businesses..We think we can come in and shake up the industry.\u201d Virgin bought Northern Rock at the end of last year and plans to turn all 75 branches into Virgin Money branches during 2012.

VSharp business wear is essential to make the right impression, but you need to be comfortable on the job.

It is a little bit off the beaten track, in a rural rice-farming region \u2014 but if you do make the pilgrimage up to the North of Thailand to witness this wonder, you certainly won\u2019t regret it. Make sure to keep your eyes peeled for the rare birds that call the lake and surrounding wetlands home.  Yep. It\u2019s a beach filled with monkeys. Lots and lots of monkeys. This small strip of sand is tucked into a cove of Ao Ling, Phi Phi Island. It is a common stop for the Phi Phi Island boat, if that\u2019s your preferred method of travel, but to avoid the tourists, it can also be reached by renting a water taxi or kayak from Phi Phi\u2019s Loh Dalum Bay. These monkeys are a rare treat, they\u2019re friendly and reasonably passive. They love people and will happily pose for photos or chill beside you on the beach. However, they\u2019re still monkeys. Keep physical interactions limited to passing food and maybe a handshake.    Temple of the Great Relic, Wat Mahathat of Bangkok was built to house a relic of Buddha in the 14th century. Despite some structural collapses over the years, it\u2019s one of the oldest standing sites in Thailand. The grounds of the temple are filled with ancient relics, structures and statues and it\u2019s also home to the Buddha head embedded in tree roots, one of the iconic images of Thailand. This ancient temple is now home to Thailand\u2019s largest monastic order, the Mahanikai school of Buddhism, and it\u2019s also a Vispassana Meditation centre  Surin Beach is the beach from the travel ads \u2014 think white sand and aquamarine water. If you\u2019re looking for tranquillity and a few killer photos, this is the place to go.\u000aIt\u2019s often missed by tourists vacationing on the Thai island of Phuket because it is about 20 minutes by car north of the main district of Patong. As a result it\u2019s one of the quieter and least populated beaches in Phuket, making it the ideal place to relax and chill out.  Don\u2019t bother heading here for nightlife \u2014 most of the nightclubs were all torn down during the 2014 coup.\u000a This stunning national park is home to awesome waterfalls, with the highest said to resemble the mythical three-headed white elephant Erawan. The rocks in the park are mostly limestone which, when eroded by the water has resulted in some truly spectacular rock formations and brightly coloured plunge pools.  Erawan is a great secluded place to swim, hike and explore.\u000a You know where to go, now here\u2019s how to not stand out as a wide eyed tourist.\u000a\u000a1. Tuk Tuks Vs Taxis\u000a\u000aTuk tuks are a popular tourist gimmick so they often try to charge the unsuspecting foreigner quite a bit more than a regular taxi. Always agree on a price with the driver before getting in \u2014 ask your hotel concierge or the information desk at the airport for an idea of prices. It should cost roughly 8000 baht from Phuket airport to the main district, Patong. For Bangkok, it should cost roughly 1000 baht from the airport to the centre of town.  In particularly touristy areas, tuk tuk drivers are also sometimes paid by stores to bring them customers. So while you might ask to be taken back to your hotel, you might find yourself on route to tailor or jewellery shop instead. If using a tuk tuk, try to always take one from a designated stand and be very clear about where you want to go. \u000a2. Eat Where The Locals Eat\u000a\u000aYou\u2019re not going to find the best Thai food at a beach side café chain visited only by tourists. Also, you\u2019ll look like a clueless foreigner. Sometimes the best food is found at the dodgy-looking, hole in the wall eatery packed to the brim with Thai people. You definitely won\u2019t accidentally be given tap water there, either.   \u000a3. Never Accept The First Price\u000a\u000aWhen perusing through the markets, it\u2019s important to know that the shopkeepers will expect you to barter with them. When you ask how much something is, the price they give you will be significantly more than they expect you to pay. You should try to negotiate the price as low as possible. They will never accept a price that leaves them unhappy so don\u2019t be concerned that you\u2019re driving too hard a bargain.  \u000a4. The good stuff is in the back\u000a\u000aIf you see a stall with a few things that you like, ask the shopkeeper: \u201cdo you have any more like this?\u201d. If they do, they\u2019ll signal you to follow them to the back room. Sometimes it\u2019s a little bit of a walk, but once you get there you\u2019ll be a in a lovely air-conditioned room with display cases full of all the good stuff they don\u2019t want to get dirty or stolen on the street.  \u000a5. A Little Bit of Thai Goes A Long Way\u000a\u000aSaying hello (swad-dee kha for women or swad-dee krub for men) and thank you (kop khun kha for women or kop khun krub for men) in Thai will not only get you a long way with locals, but it will make you sound like less of a tourist.

VHumans have long strived to create machines with heart and those at the forefront of robotics are edging closer to such a breakthrough. Whether the relationship we form with robots in the coming years is one way, or, eventually reciprocal, there is no doubt that these mechanical giants could become as integral to our lives as a beloved family animal or colleague. But will we ever be able to build authentic rapport? Brought to you by Deakin University\u2019s This. To uncover more unique stories on contemporary topics, visit this.deakin.edu.au When Big Hero 6\u2019s Baymax waddled his way onto screens in 2014, he did more than entertain children and adults alike, he helped to reset our perception of what robot friends might look like in the future. It\u2019s easy to assume that Disney used plenty of creative license to conjure up Baymax, yet this fictional animation reflects very real research into soft robotics. For many of us, cuddly characters don\u2019t usually spring to mind when we\u2019re asked to imagine the robots of our near future, but while conceiving Baymax, Disney director Don Hall was inspired by a real inflatable arm design created by researchers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While Baymax, with his artificial intelligence, is far more advanced than anything that currently exists in the field of robotics, he does provide a hint of what\u2019s to come. Appealing tactile qualities have always been a consideration in technology design so it makes sense that researchers will look to merge machinery with materials that don\u2019t make us recoil. In the coming years, robotic limbs made of balloon-style fabrics are plausible, but genuine companionship could be a lifetime away, according to Deakin University\u2019s expert in mechatronics, Dr Ben Horan.  We will see robots providing personal assistance, helping elderly people to get in and out of bed, for example. \u201cHelping someone out of bed might not be the most complex task, but it does require physical strength that a robot can provide,\u201d he says. In Japan, that robot could be coming to hospitals and aged care facilities soon. Robear was created by scientist Toshiharu Mukai as a tool to assist the ageing Japanese population. The cuteness was a consideration for Mukai. \u201cPatients, especially old people, don\u2019t like mechanical appearance. Patients need to feel that robots are their friends,\u201d he told The Verge in April 2015. Robear is still too expensive to be commercially available, but he could be present in the coming decades. Helpful robots are already stepping (and rolling!) into our everyday lives. Consider Roomba, the iRobot, which will vacuum your floors for you everyday. It\u2019ll set you back about US$600, but what price can you put on having your very own robotic vacuum cleaner gobbling the dirt and dust from your floors while you kick back and relax? Baxter, a manufacturing robot designed to work in factories, is among the most progressive of his kind. When we meet Baxter he\u2019s playing a casual game of Connect Four at Deakin\u2019s Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus. While Baxter was created in the US, it is possible for anyone to teach him a new trick by writing software. Dr Horan says there was a gap in the market for a robot that could work with humans and they\u2019re exploring the kinds of tasks they can assign him.  Baxter\u2019s low inertia, plastic- and foam-covered exterior and smiling face make him a gentle ally, but is he a threat to the workforce? Dr Horan is quick to point out that despite looking like a replacement for human factory workers, Baxter simply shifts the responsibility. \u201cWe still need humans to manage the robots. And a robot can be in a situation where it might get crushed, but we don\u2019t lose a life.\u201d Just don\u2019t mention that near Baxter. Rachael Oates, marketing and communications manager for Sage Automation, the Australian distributor of Baxter, says that the Haigh\u2019s Chocolate manufacturing facility in Australia was the first to apply Baxter\u2019s skills to the production line. At $35,000, Baxter costs about the same amount as a minimum wage factory worker and doesn\u2019t demand sick days, holiday pay, breaks or better conditions. However, he represents a shift in the way that humans might work in the future. Rather than being bogged down with repetitive tasks, humans are free to spend more time planning and evolving their businesses. Mortimer suggests that although movies like Chappie and Ex-Machina create a sense that the capacity for the human-robot relationship is not outside the realm of possibility, their ability to be our friends in a cognitive sense may never come to fruition.  \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make a robot do something, it\u2019s another thing to instil cognitive behaviour and human emotion in it,\u201d he says and explains that in the artificial intelligence space what really gives robots their edge is their memory and their ability to search for answers faster than humans do. He says the Hollywood take on artificial intelligence creates an illusion.  \u201cRobots and products with the capacity for artificial intelligence aren\u2019t really as sophisticated as one might be led to believe. In many instances searching a database looking for an answer can surpass current capabilities of onboard artificial intelligence,\u201d Mortimer adds. While robots don\u2019t have the capacity to feel a two-way empathetic relationship, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t feel empathy for them. When Google-owned robotics firm Boston Dynamics posted a YouTube video of their robotic dog, Spot, being kicked there was outcry. You can\u2019t kick a dog, even if it is a robot, people said.  Although the seemingly aggressive act was used to destabilise the dog only to highlight his ability to find his feet again, it raised a wider ethical technology dilemma \u2014 do we need to respect things that can\u2019t respect us back? Whether we\u2019ve taken the time to think about it or not, the fact that people gasp or cringe when this little robotic animal stumbles is a sign that we already have an unspoken respect for technology that makes our lives easier. At the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) robotics challenge in June 2015, robots created by tech companies competed to shut down a mock nuclear reactor in Pomona, California. Novelty aside, the crowd was audibly moved by the robots\u2019 falls and triumphs along the way.  The challenge organiser, Gill Pratt, said in a statement, \u201cWe heard groans of sympathy when those robots fell. And what did people do every time a robot scored a point? They cheered. It\u2019s an extraordinary thing.\u201d Dr Horan concurs, adding; \u201cIt\u2019s not good for us as a society if we start disrespecting the technologies that we rely on.\u201d The ethical code of conduct towards robots might not exist yet, but there\u2019s every chance that we\u2019ll come to give robots the same kind of quiet love we give our iPhones and our computers in return for their thankless commitment to making our days easier. Could humans be responsible for manufacturing their own enemy? If Avengers: The Age of Ultron is to be believed, the artificial intelligence we create in robots could in turn be humanity\u2019s undoing. In the Hollywood blockbuster, Ultron is programmed to believe that he must eradicate humanity. It\u2019s the kind of science fiction that\u2019s best served with popcorn, but it does raise concerns about the potential for autonomous killer robots to exist one day.  Are we really ready for robots to make their own decisions? In 2015, Defence Force personnel are trained to use armed drones \u2014 these flying robots are sophisticated enough to kill at the push of a button. Deakin University\u2019s mechatronics expert, Dr Ben Horan says you needn\u2019t run screaming through the streets for fear of killer robots just yet, though. Uncontrollable Terminator-style technology won\u2019t contribute to war efforts any time soon. However, robots are fast becoming far more capable than ever before. Google-owned Boston Dynamics has developed humanoid robots Atlas and Escher. With the US military pouring billions of dollars in to research and development of these eerily agile machines, it\u2019s no wonder people hold a genuine fear that autonomous robots could one day turn on us. When this sort of technology is owned by one of the world\u2019s most ubiquitous companies, there\u2019s no assured limit to how far they could take it. Indeed, there are already cases of robots causing fatal harm. In July 2015, a 22-year-old Volkswagen factory worker was killed after a robot crushed him. Although a spokesperson said human error was to blame, someone must be accountable. Reports indicate that prosecutors are considering whether criminal charges should be laid. International coalition, Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, is a pre-emptive attempt to have an international ban placed on autonomous weapons. In a statement on their website, the coalition argue, \u201cGiving machines the power to decide who lives and dies on the battlefield is an unacceptable application of technology. Human control over any combat robot is essential to ensuring both humanitarian protection and effective legal control.\u201d In 2014, they were present at a United Nations meeting in Geneva, arguing that there were important legal and moral considerations to make moving forward and pushed for human control. Not everyone agrees with their agenda, though. NBC News technology writer Keith Wagstaff said, \u201chysteria over the robopocalypse could hold back technology that would save human lives.\u201d Around the world, the Navy and other military organisations have been using automated weapons for years. Michael Mortimer, PhD student at Deakin University, says extensive advances in artificial intelligence would need to occur if we were going to see a true dawn of the killer robots. He argues that military robotics, like any technological advance, are intended to be used for good and killer robots inflicting mass destruction in the future is unlikely. But he does admit that while most robotic research is conducted with the intention of assisting humans, any technology in the wrong hands can become dangerous. \u201cWhatever tool you give people, how they use it comes down to human psyche.\u201d There\u2019s no need for Hollywood to over-dramatise the rise of drones. Semi-autonomous military aircraft are becoming increasingly prevalent, taking to the skies and battling through conflict on our behalves. In a time when robotic technology is fast becoming a war imperative, you\u2019d be right to feel a bit uneasy about these things hovering above you. Among the most advanced is the US Air Force\u2019s Global Hawk which can fly and spy for up to 30 hours non-stop.  However, Mortimier points out that drones like the Global Hawk ultimately have a human responsible for pressing the buttons. In fact, \u201cthey utilise a large number of operating staff to get it going\u201d. Dr Horan adds, \u201cthe processes surrounding the operation are far beyond what perhaps one fighter jet pilot would have. There are so many processes behind the scenes before any decisions are made.\u201d The Australian Army is now operating unmanned aerial vehicles in order to provide intelligence surveillance. Dr Horan says this is not a conspiracy. \u201cIn defence they\u2019re looking at how to reduce the danger for Australian military personnel,\u201d he points out. In addition, tools are also being developed to assist developing nations where, in some cases, people are using very basic tools like sticks to probe mines. Dr Horan says this shows that the military isn\u2019t the enemy. \u201cRobots can go into hazardous locations and deactivate mines.\u201d But even if military robots are intended to be used for good, it\u2019s doubtless that where wars are concerned robots could be used for ill-intended purposes. DARPA\u2019s advanced drone ARGUS- IS, a 1.8 gigapixel camera can watch targets across a 25-square kilometre stretch from 20,000 feet in the air \u2014 that\u2019s like monitoring all of Manhattan at once through one lens. In the wrong hands, it\u2019s not hard to imagine some worrying situations. In Australia, there are laws that protect a person\u2019s privacy to a point, but in many cases, the technology is developing faster than the legislation. Despite that, Dr Horan says paranoia is not warranted. \u201cThere have been satellites with cameras in them for quite a while. People were worried about being watched through Google glasses,\u201d he says. Even cameras in mobile phones give civilians their own surveillance capabilities, if they choose to use them. But that\u2019s hardly comparable to the rise of mass surveillance. \u201cWe do need to be conscious of the ethical considerations surrounding the use of robots. It falls under the umbrella of ethical considerations we apply to all technologies,\u201d Dr Horan cautions.   A better application for surveillance droids is in the field of search and rescue. In future, you can expect to see robots that look like BB-8 from the upcoming Star Wars film, rolling into dangerous situations. His real world purpose would be to use his floating head and small spherical body to get into tight spaces and collect data for humans to interpret. It\u2019s hard to be completely sure of what large tech companies and military groups are working towards when developments are so closely guarded so for now, we\u2019ll have to trust that there\u2019s nothing to fear unless we\u2019re given a reason to. A lot of what we\u2019re seeing in science fiction still remains just that. So it might be best to remain alert rather than alarmed. As aspects of the imagined futures we see in films begin to become reality, let\u2019s hope that any artificially intelligent robots that do come to exist are trained to suppress any appetite for destruction.

VDitching the ageing Windows Mobile OS and starting from scratch with a brand new operating system, Microsoft have unleashed Windows Phone 7 (WP7) upon the tech world. It\u2019s a slick new addition to the smartphone scene, with neat animations and integrated social features throughout. Several manufacturers have already taken up the challenge and produced Windows 7 phones including HTC, Samsung and LG (you can win an LG Optimus 7 Windows smartphone by clicking here). Take a look at our ten point guide (or watch the video) below for everything you need to know.  Live Tiles \u2013 WP7\u2019s Live Tiles are dynamic links to applications and features stored on Windows Phone 7 devices. Updated in real-time, Live Tiles can be set to offer info at a glance on specific contacts, social networks, email accounts or news feeds such as weather details or stocks. Like fancy shortcuts or widgets, they are fully customisable, to be arranged how you see fit across the phones homescreens, and are fully animated to boot.   People Hub \u2013 The People Hub is an area of the phone which collects all your contact details into one place. Whether it\u2019s info relating to people from your phone book, email accounts or social networks, you\u2019ll be able to communicate with any contact you have, wherever they may be, from the People Hub. Pictures Hub \u2013 Like the People Hub, the Pictures Hub aggregates images from multiple sources, collecting them into one easily searched place.

Xbox Live \u2013 Gaming fans will be pleased to hear that WP7 devices can be synced up with your Xbox 360\u2019s Live account, linking your phone to the online community. Gamertags, Gamerscores and achievements will carry over across both devices, meaning you\u2019re always rewarded when gaming on the go.  Mobile Office \u2013 When you\u2019re done playing, you can get some serious work done with WP7 too. Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents can all be edited on the go, with cloud sharing and back-up capable through Sharepoint. A very comfortable on-screen keyboard makes text entry a breeze too. Search \u2013 With so much to do and store possible on smartphones these days, you\u2019d better have a good way of searching the contents of your phone if you\u2019re hoping to get at the stuff you need fast. With Bing web search, the voice-powered TellMe search app and a hardware search button on every WP7 device, you\u2019ll find what you need in no time at all. Hardware \u2013 To make sure users get the best Windows Phone 7 experience possible, Microsoft have laid down strict hardware guidelines to handset manufacturers. Minimum requirements include a capacitive multi-touch screen, a 5MP camera and at least a 1GHz ARM v7 Cortex/Scorpion processor. This means you\u2019ll never have a shoddy bit of kit in your hand if it\u2019s marked with the WP7 seal of approval.   And what the makers added\u2026 \u2013 Each Windows 7 device has these basic specifications, what the manufacturer add is then up to them. So for example the Samsung\u2019s Windows & phones are noted for AMOLED display, while HTC are offering various phones at various price points.  The LG Optimus 7 has a host of additional features including Augmented Reality system ScanSeach that automatically detects any amenities up to a five-mile radius. The results including: restaurants, bars, hotels, public transit and banks, appear as icons, which you can then tap to reveal that specific amenities phone number and exact location. There\u2019s also the panorama app for the handset\u2019s camera which makes it easy to take snapshots of wide landscapes by lining up five images in a row, and automatically firing off the shutter when each image is aligned. According to LG all its Windows 7 devices are good for practical use and will be supported by excellent battery life (the Optimus 7 has the best battery life of any Windows 7 phone) and LG exclusive apps. Some handsets will also support qwerty keypads. Sponsored post from LG\u000a

VWhen you\u2019re choosing an in-car navigation device, it\u2019s important to consider the maps inside- who created them, how often are they updated and how much of Australia they cover. With so many devices on the market the choice can often be a difficult one. So, consider this, if you were lost in an unfamiliar city would you pull over and ask a local or a tourist for directions?  Whereis® maps are created by Australians for Australians. Every year a team of Australian navigational experts drive thousands of kilometres capturing the detail of the Australian roads. Using custom designed high-tech data capture vehicles, they are able to collect road change information, enriching maps and including more location data on safety  infrastructure like red and speed camera locations, school zones and railway crossings mapping Australian roads in detail.   The mapping teams also head out to rural, coastal and outback areas to map and refine the co-ordinates of remote roads and 4 Wheel Drive tracks, ensuring that as much of Australia as possible is covered accurately. If you want a local digital map that goes the extra mile, choose Whereis®. Footnote: Garmin, TomTom and Uniden all feature Whereis® maps. Make sure you keep an eye out for their devices.

V Motorola\u2019s making a comeback with the recent launch of two new handsets, DEXT and BACKFLIP. They\u2019re the first to feature Motorola\u2019s Android-powered MOTOBLUR interface, and it\u2019s a combination that brings endless possibilities for customisation. And apps. Lots of apps. Apps\u000aThere are endless possibilities for personalisation with one-tap access to over 20,000 apps in the Android Market. DEXT and BACKFLIP come pre-loaded with popular apps like Shazam and Google services we can\u2019t do without, like Maps, YouTube, GTalk and Gmail. You can add the apps you use the most onto the home screen, with just a single tap, and keep the rest tucked out of the way in a simple pull-out drawer on the side.  Email and Notifications\u000aMOTOBLUR syncs your POP3 and IMAP email accounts, and it even supports Microsoft Exchange for people that like to work outside of work hours. Notifications for new messages appear as icons in the top left corner, which can be expanded into a summary with a pull-down menu.  Neat feature: Emails are composed in rich text, because when text is less boring to look at, it\u2019s more likely to be read. Contacts\u000aAutomatically synced, just like everything else MOTOBLUR streams in real time. It handles all your contacts, including, interestingly, everyone on Facebook and Twitter, and when someone changes their photo, status or contact details, MOTOBLUR automatically updates that info on your phone. MOTOBLUR even looks for data that may indicate that two different contacts are, in fact, the same person and merges them together. Very handy if you have lots of online friends who are also friends IRL. Motorola\u2019s partnered up exclusively with Optus to offer the DEXT and BACKFLIP on new \u2018social\u2019 plans ranging between $19 and $99 per month.

V Sponsored post Richer Sounds explains how to choose a 3D TV that is right for your needs Christmas 2010 saw a boom in the sales of 3D TV bundles with a torrent of fantastic deals geared towards those buying for the holiday season. Luckily, this means that prices have stayed fairly competitive and you can still pick up a great deal on the latest models. Finding the cheapest 3D TV can often be a bit of a trawl; some online price comparison sites are so keen to have you pay for the click that you often find that the deal isn\u2019t quite as amazing as you first thought, and finding the right one can end up being as time consuming as physically travelling between shops and comparing the offers yourself. The cheapest is also rarely the best and understanding the differences in the technology, whether it be a Samsung or a Panasonic 3D TV, can be tricky. The aim of this article is to give you the basics on what to look for to find the 3D TV. Choose the right size TV The first thing to do is outline what specification would suit you best, starting with size. It can be easy to fall into the trap of wanting a 50-inch TV, but it\u2019s hardly worth the extra cost if it\u2019s going to dominate a tiny living room.  Take a tape measure to the area where you want your television to go and give it a quick assessment. Remember that the number of inches attributed to a screen is measured diagonally and not horizontally, otherwise you may believe that a smaller television is enough. If you want the television to sit on a wall, make allowances in cost for wall mounting kits. Some offers will bundle one with it, but you may find that they are a rather costly add on, especially if you are planning on buying a really large screen. Alternatively, if you are planning on investing in a new stand, the same applies. Once you have settled on what sort of size you\u2019re looking for, you will want to make sure you are getting the most out of your new television. 3D TV sets come with a variety of different settings and add-ons and these can be the difference between getting a truly great deal and not. Which type of display? The first thing you may want to decide on is which screen type you desire. There are generally three different choices; you can either choose a liquid crystal display (LCD), a plasma screen or a light emitting diode (LED) television. An LCD screen will last for a long time and generally omits a very clear picture, although these are generally a little more expensive than plasma screens. Plasmas do look sharp and will produce a high quality picture, but they may eventually need replacing and are susceptible to image burning when a still image is left on the television for an elongated period of time. The latest invention in television screens is LED technology. An LED television is actually fitted with an LCD screen but use LEDs as a backlight, which improves colour reproduction and contrast ratios. You will find that most of the latest televisions are using this technology, but it will add a few extra pounds to the price. For those looking for an all-round solution that will last, a standard LCD set should do, but if you want something with a little more clarity, then the LED may be what you need. Resolution is often something that those buying a new television set may miss out on; the higher the resolution, the clearer the image will be displayed. Resolution is the total number of different specks of colour (pixels) shown by a television set and a few extra hundred can really make the difference in an image. This is less important if you are planning on using the television for just watching, but for those who plan on gaming or connecting a computer screen, this can be a high priority. Multimedia functionality Another important thing to note is any extras that you may have built into the set. Some of the latest televisions can play digital media, such as MP3 files or movies, straight from a memory stick. Others even boast the ability to connect to the Internet, allowing you to check your email, Facebook or catch up with the latest in on-demand television using services such as the BBC iPlayer. These add-ons can be exceptionally useful and well worth a few extra quid in the long run.\u000a\u000a3D glasses  Finally, the cost of extra 3D glasses has to be built into the overall cost of the product. You may find a television at a discount price but find that you only receive one pair bundled with the set. If you can find a deal with a few more pairs bundled then it might be worthwhile, otherwise check out the cost of an extra pair as the standard price is normally around £50.\u000a\u000aRicher Sounds

V GPS phones are definitely all the rage these days, but that doesn\u2019t mean they actually make navigating easy. The Nokia 6710 Navigator does, though. And it\u2019s all thanks to the touch-sensitive zoom bar.  Tucked in below the display, this nifty little feature lets you zoom in and out of maps on the 2.6\u2033 screen. Just drag your finger in whatever direction you want. And if that little gem isn\u2019t enough to jump up and down like a goose, wait for it; the zoom panel also works in the web browser and media gallery.

V LG recently launched the Optimus 7 E900, their first venture into the Windows Phone 7 ring. It\u2019s a solid touchscreen phone with an easy to use interface. It has a good weight and feels well-built with its back cover constructed from a durable metal. Like other Windows 7 phones, the Optimus has three buttons on the front: Back, Home and Bing search. Unlike some handsets the LG model had proper physical clicking buttons, rather than the touch-sensitive ones, making it just a bit easier to use. High res screen The Optimus 7 has a 3.8-inch WVGA LCD display, with a resolution of 800×480 pixels. In other words there is no blurriness, users can clearly make out detail and the colours are incredibly vivid. Although the phone is fairly large it can still easily fit into your pocket and is good for watching videos and viewing pictures.  Powerful battery The phone also boasts a very efficient and powerful, battery which utilizes LG\u2019s own battery algorithm to maximize efficiency. By offering 1500 mAh, the largest battery capacity among WP7 devices, it delivers a reliable and stress-free experience for consumers. It also delivers the best talk and standy time of any Windows Mobile 7 handset \u2013 Talk time: 480 min / Standby: 416 hrs Due to Microsoft\u2019s strict minimum hardware specifications, most of the Windows Phone 7 devices have similar specs including approximately 8GB of memory, a 1GHz processor and at least a 5-megapixel camera. However, the Optimus differentiates itself here by packing 16GB of on-board storage. This is particularly useful for users as Windows Phone 7 does not support external memory cards.  Games and music Again all Windows Phone 7 handsets have the same user interface, which we will delve into further in our \u201ceverything you need to know about Windows Phone 7\u201d post. However, some of our favourite features include the integration with Xbox Live, Zune music and Office. The phone operates through six hubs: People, Games, Pictures, Music and Video, Market Place and Office. These hubs are some what interactive, for example your avatar in the Games hub will be supplied from your Xbox Live account. To launch a hub you simply flick the screen right to access the next screen. The screens are on a loop making it quick and simple to navigate through. Also on the home screen sit static tiles which you can set up to work as shortcuts to applications. Windows 7 also has its own dedicated app store called the The Marketplace. The number of apps is growing quickly as many developers already familiar with Window\u2019s platform have begun to develop apps for the new phones. Most apps start at 79p..  Fun stuff The Optimus 7 comes pre-loaded with a number of apps including a fun panorama app and the ScanSearch augmented-reality app. The panorama app makes it easy to take snapshots of wide landscapes by lining up five images in a row, and automatically firing off the shutter when each image is aligned. ScanSearch, which is unique to the phone, is an Augmented Reality app that automatically detects any amenities up to a five-mile radius. The results including: restaurants, bars, hotels, public transit and banks, appear as icons, which you can then tap to reveal that specific amenities phone number and exact location. The Optimus 7 has a 5-megapixel camera and comes with an LED flash, which is always useful if you are trying to take a picture in dimly lit rooms. The camera has a number of other noteworthy features including the automatic \u2018intelligent shot\u2019 which is useful if you want to quickly catch that snapshot. In addition to taking photos, it is also capable of capturing 720p high definition video. Or if you want to get that cinematic feel, you can even capture video in a 16:9 aspect ratio.  Sharing media from the Optimus 7 is made very simple through LG\u2019s DLNA sharing feature \u201cPlay To.\u201d This allows you to transfer your music, photos and video to any other DNLA-equipped device, such as your TV, provided that it is on the same Wi-Fi network. The LG Optimus 7 is a fast and easy to use phone with a number of great features.

V Photography is meant to be fun. Sometimes, though, cameras get in the way, delivering blurry photos ruined by shaky hands or a gust of wind. The Olympus OM-D EM-1 takes away that stress with an integrated image stabiliser that works continually to make sure your photos and video are crisp and clear \u2014 regardless of the lens you\u2019re using. \u000a Also: Olympus OM-D E-M1 Key Features Explained:\u000aEasy Long Exposures, Time Lapse, HDR, Built-In Wi-Fi And More Olympus\u2019 image stabilisation system is incredibly advanced. Some cameras and lenses from other brands have image stabilisation, but they usually only work to compensate for a bit of left-right or up-down camera shake or wobble. Olympus\u2019 solution goes much further \u2014 it eliminates vibration and camera shake across both the vertical and horizontal axes, neutralising accidental tilting, turning, shifting, and rolling.  Every image stabilising feature inside the OM-D E-M1 works automatically, so you don\u2019t even have to enable it \u2014 just half-press the camera\u2019s shutter button, and the rest is automatic. If you have shaky hands, the E-M1 compensates for it. If you drift off your target horizontally or vertically, the E-M1 will hold it still until you capture the photo. The OM-D E-M1\u2019s image stabilisation is smart, too. The camera\u2019s IS-AUTO mode knows when you\u2019re panning during video, and keeps vertical shake to a minimum without interrupting the horizontal movement you\u2019re trying to capture. You can even pan vertically or diagonally, and the E-M1 will make sure your video is smooth and blur-free.  Other brands might make you pay more for an optical image stabiliser in their lenses, but Olympus\u2019 in-body image stabiliser in the OM-D E-M1 means the company\u2019s lenses are smaller, lighter and cheaper. Because it\u2019s closer to your arms, in-body image stabilisation more effectively cuts down on blur from shaky hands or movement.  Even better than that, though, is that you can use any other lens you buy \u2014 like a beautiful classic Olympus Zuiko 100mm F2.0 from the 1980s, for example \u2014 on the Olympus OM-D E-M1 with an adapter. And when you\u2019re using that lens on the E-M1, you get every single benefit of image stabilisation that we\u2019ve mentioned, updating your old lenses with the absolute latest in camera technology. Because Olympus\u2019 Micro Four Thirds lens mount is so versatile, you can use thousands of legacy lenses from dozens of vintage cameras on the E-M1, all with smooth image stabilisation that lets you take creative photos or video, without any complicated accessories or searching through menus. Whether you\u2019re taking a quick photo or capturing a video segment, Olympus\u2019 5-axis image stabiliser in the OM-D E-M1 works tirelessly to help you out.

VTechnology holds the potential to seriously enhance businesses. For one gift delivery company in Adelaide it\u2019s been the difference between staying a startup and growing into a national success. Adelaide-based Kelly Jamieson dreamed to have the business she founded and loved \u2013 Edible Blooms \u2013 go national. The gift delivery service, which mimics flower delivery but replaces the flowers with fresh fruit and chocolate, was a proven success in her hometown, but the next step called. Image: supplied  Edible Blooms now has offices in Brisbane, Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Auckland. With a little help from the right partners and smart use of technology to keep her connected in the office and while she\u2019s on the go, the dream is well on its way to being realised \u2013 if not surpassed.  So how did Kelly take her business from simple idea to next-gen digital reality? These days, 70 to 80 per cent of Edible Blooms\u2019 orders come through its website, and the business has firmly established itself as an sales channel. \u201cIt made sense to create an eCommerce platform, with all the digital opportunities that were arising,\u201d explains Kelly. \u201cIt was so much more cost effective, and it meant that we could have 100 per cent control of our growth if we did it ourselves.\u201d Edible Blooms now uses Neto: an end-to-end solution for selling online, in order to run the business. The online store integrates with leading accounting platforms, payment gateways, shipping carriers and CRM solutions. When adopting the technology \u2013 which integrates with leading accounting platforms, payment gateways, shipping carriers and CRM solutions \u2013 Edible Blooms saw a 15 per cent increase in average shopping cart sales. Kelly attributes this to a better user experience, with less glitches than before and an easy-to-use interface. Because of Neto\u2019s ability to synchronise, report in real time and automate services such as a label printing system for couriers, it has streamlined processes that would have otherwise been labour intensive, such as accounting and shipping. \u201cWe felt we saved at least half of an administrative staff member for every location,\u201d says Kelly, adding that they\u2019ve \u201chad a 10 per cent productivity gain.\u201d The next step towards best practice for Edible Blooms was moving to the cloud \u2013 taking advantage of what many businesses are starting to see as a better way of doing business: both for the business\u2019 bottom line and its scope for streamlining. So in 2008, that\u2019s exactly what Edible Blooms did \u2013 becoming an early adopter and helping gain visibility over the growing operation. \u201cWe had to change every business process: from the way orders were dispatched to the way we communicated with our customers and the way orders came through the website into our back end. We had to look at that complete map.\u201d Nowadays Kelly spends most of her time working remotely from her farm, an hour\u2019s drive from Adelaide, only heading into the company\u2019s head office a couple of days a week.  \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself to be a technology expert, but with our partnership with Telstra that makes it possible for me to actually run my business on the go,\u201d she says. \u201cI never thought it would give me the amount of flexibility that it\u2019s given me. I mean I still work really hard but I can work where I want to work.\u201d By making the most of the cloud, Kelly can stay plugged in to her business without actually having to be there.  Most of the staff at Edible Blooms are florists. When an order is placed, construction of the bouquet begins. Due to the company\u2019s many locations and growing number of staff around the country, being able to manage the workforce and the workflow effectively while on the move is crucial to smooth operation and happy flower recipients.  Edible Blooms uses an app called Deputy to manage staff, giving the business the ability to remotely schedule employees, manage task delegation and log time and attendance. The app works on both desktop and mobile \u2013 meaning Kelly can keep an eye on her national workforce from wherever she is.  Clever digital solutions served as the building blocks for Kelly\u2019s initial idea, and hard work and enthusiasm have ensured the dream comes to fruition. Continuously developing its product offering through the use of technology is at the top of the agenda for Edible Blooms, and innovation is essential. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a strong focus on reinvesting into the business,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cEach new win can mean new technology or a new approach.\u201d

p540
VSo, quick and simple question for you guys and girls \u2014 what is most likely to make you pre-order a video game? \u000a I will be more interested in pre ordering a game if there is lots of details about its game play ill be very less likely if there is no game play details or footage of the ingame. also more likley to pre order a game if it is from a series or franchise i follow. I will not pre order a game if the predecessor was a flop. Where's the "Because I want the game on release day" option? This Thankee i cant find it either I haven't seen or heard of a release in years that has genuinely "sold out" on release day since the major retailers have started taking gaming seriously.. Where is the "Cheaper than expected RRP" option? That's the only reason I bother.. this "exclusive" pre-order bonus stuff is pretty much pointless these days. The only option that comes close to a reason I would pre-order is the "access to demo".. but it would have to be "access to beta testing" rather than just a demo.. demos are used to sell the game to people who aren't sure they want it in the first place.. they should be and usually are free for that very purpose.. tagged on as a pre-order "bonus" is just a cop-out. Agreed. Most of the time when I pre-order it's because I was planning to buy anyway (unless getting super-slammed by reviews) and I expect that pre-order will cheaper than 1-month-post-release eg. Starcraft II, Skyrim. Where is the " I dont buy pre-orders" option because 90% of the addons are rubish? I do like the props though. I sometimes preorder because the price is discounted from release price. Yeah maybe with the EB's SRP price.  But if you go to Big W within a week after release games are generally $30-$50 cheaper than EB or JB I have to say, Mass Effect 3 has stopped me ever pre-ordering anything again.\u000a$130 got me an 'art book' full of spoilers, an 'exclusive' character and mission that were actually available to all on day one and a fabric patch (yay).\u000aToo bad that the product was so under-cooked (the face import bug being the worst offender here).\u000aThis experience, plus the force multi-player and obligatory grinding mobile apps meant that I'll never be pre-ordering again, nor supporting anything EA. Last game I pre-ordered was Wind Waker and that was for Ocarina of Time and because I was genuinely worried that it may sell out on release day. I preorder a game if I want it on launch day and don't want it to sell out.

We also know that you won\u2019t see results overnight and no product on earth can turn you into Vin Diesel. What many of us don\u2019t know is the science behind building muscle and how you can help your body along. Quick breakdown of the facts:\u000a\u2022 Muscle building is a natural process and is your body\u2019s reaction to damage from strenuous activity \u000a\u2022 The body will overcompensate to reduce the risk of this damage happening again by building more muscle than needed \u000a\u2022 By gradually increasing the workload for your muscles through increased repetitions, heavier weights or frequency of exercise you can build your muscles up\u000a\u2022 Your body uses amino acids to build muscles\u000a\u2022 Amino acids are the structural units that make up protein\u000a\u2022 To give your body the amino acids it needs to build muscle you need to increase the amount of protein you take on board\u000a\u2022 The process of building muscle slows if you do not have sufficient protein The level of protein you require can be obtained through changing your diet to focus around eating turkey, chicken and fish. These have to be eaten in larger quantities and regularly. If you are like 90% of the population and not quite ready to relinquish potatoes, pasta and rice in favour of high protein foods, then you can supplement your intake with protein shakes. Protein shakes are often based around whey protein and this is because it contains high levels of all the essential fatty acids (amino acids) that your body cannot synthesise and must be added through diet. You will need to have 2 \u2013 4 protein shakes per day depending on the level of exercise you are doing. You will consume a 1kg bag of whey protein powder in 20 days if you have 2 a day, or 10 days if you have 4 per day. If we take a figure in the middle \u2013 15 days, you will be using 2kgs per month. This can begin to be expensive, but you don\u2019t want your hard work going to waste.\u000aPro-10 offers high quality whey protein, but they have reduced the price to only £12.99 per 1kg. Gram for gram that is the same price as organic chicken breast. Each week special offers enable you to try new supplements or bundle packs, and they are launching over 40 new products over the next 6 months. There is no witchcraft involved with protein shakes and if you want to see the best results from all your hard work then take advantage of our 10% discount to give it a try. Visit www.Pro-10.com and enter TECH10 at the checkout to receive your discount.
